        "content": "Pittsburgh Creche Endowment Fund | The Pittsburgh Foundation Skip to main content Return to CFWestmoreland.org Searching for a specific fund? Searching for a scholarship? Pittsburgh Creche Endowment Fund Established: 10/31/2006 Donate Now How the Cr√®che came to Pittsburgh is an example of how a diverse community joined together to accomplish a goal. In 1996, the Christian Leaders Fellowship displayed a Nativity scene near Gateway Center on city property. In 1998, the City of Pittsburgh decided such displays could no longer be erected on government property. Around this same time, Louis D. Astorino, a pre-eminent architect and member of the Christmas Festival Committee had visited the larger-than-life-sized Cr√®che at St. Peter‚Äôs Square in Rome‚Äôs Vatican City in 1993 and wanted to do something special for Pittsburgh‚Äôs Christmas Festival for the millennium. In 1997, the Festival Committee and the Christian Leaders Fellowship approved Astorino‚Äôs proposal to duplicate the Cr√®che in St. Peter‚Äôs Square at a new downtown Pittsburgh location where even more people could linger to appreciate it. Then, Catholic Diocesan Bishop Donald Wuerl contacted USX Chairman Thomas Usher, who arranged for the Cr√®che to be displayed on private property on the plaza outside of what is now the U.S. Steel Tower. Workers at the Civic Light Opera‚Äôs Construction Center built the stable and, in Rome, Umberto Mezzana who designed the original stable worked with Petro Simonelli who crafted the first nativity scene figures. Local foundations, businesses and unions contributed money, services and labor to the construction and assembly of the Cr√®che. The Sisters of the Holy Spirit now sew and maintain the clothes for all the life-sized figures. The new Cr√®che was dedicated on Dec. 6, 1999, and was displayed through Jan. 7, 2000. Every year since, volunteers and unions have donated their time and corporations have given services to help keep the Cr√®che a unique part of Pittsburgh‚Äôs holiday celebration. While much of the work on the Nativity is donated, not all the labor is free and other expenditures are necessary including truck rentals and police service. Because of winter weather conditions the nativity scene also suffers damage to the roof or to the plywood infrastructure and most years needs some repairs. It is for these additional labor and equipment costs and the as-needed restoration expenses that an endowment fund was created at The Pittsburgh Foundation. Despite all of the donated services, approximately $70,000 is needed annually to maintain the Cr√®che and to house it when it is not on display. When a shortage of funds presented the possibility that the Cr√®che might be discontinued, Christians of all denominations not only responded to address the need, but worked with The Pittsburgh Foundation to create this fund to endow The Pittsburgh Cr√®che so that it could be appreciated and enjoyed by future generations of Pittsburghers. The annual dedication of The Pittsburgh‚Äôs Cr√®che opens on Pittsburgh‚Äôs annual Light Up Night in November and remains open through Epiphany in early January. Each year an estimated 250,000 people stop to gaze at the life-like replicas and the manger scene that is the reason for the holiday celebration. The Cr√®che has become an attraction to downtown Pittsburgh allowing residents and out-of-towners to connect their beliefs with the joy of the season."

A Holiday Tradition for Over 30 Years! On Christmas Eve, Scrooge sits in his house with not a kind word for anyone; he just wants to be left alone until the \"humbug\" of Christmas is over. But four ghostly visitors - his former business partner, followed by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come - show him the error of his ways, and by the time Christmas Day dawns, Scrooge is a changed person. The entire family will enjoy this timeless classic and Pittsburgh tradition, featuring your favorite holiday carols!
