The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\" In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he‚Äôs somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

Acrisure Stadium Home of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, the stadium was designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group and opened in 2001. The horseshoe-shaped two-tiered stadium offers more intimacy than many NFL venues, with natural grass, great sight lines and a wide-open view of the football action set against the beautiful backdrop of downtown Pittsburgh. There is no such thing as a bad seat in this football-oriented stadium which was obviously designed to take football from a game to an experience. Reflecting Pittsburgh''s steel legacy, steel is a primary building material in Acrisure Stadium. The majority of the steel is silvery grey in color, except for the large gold-painted ''quad pods'' which support the upper deck. Large masonry anchors Acrisure Stadium, echoing the heavy stone bases of Pittsburgh''s downtown landmarks and bridges, such as the City-County Building and the Allegheny County Court House. Progressing up the stadium facade, the building gradually changes from steel and stone into walls of glass which reflect downtown skyscrapers such as PPG Place and Fifth Avenue Place, both of which are visible from inside the stadium. The 7,100 club seats tucked between the two levels on both sides of Acrisure Stadium offer a fantastic vantage point and access to the two three-story club lounges. These popular lounges feature a wall of glass from floor to ceiling for nearly the entire length of the building. PPG Paints Arena A multi-purpose indoor arena which is home to both the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins and the Area Football League's Pittsburgh Power. Construction was completed in 2010 and PPG Paints Arena is the first LEED¬Æ Gold certified major sports venue in the country. The venue seats 18,087 people in honor of Penguins team captain Sidney Crosby's No. 87. The Center uses 40% less water consumption by volume and thanks in part to natural lighting and high-efficiency ventilation, boasts a 31% reduction in energy consumption. As soon as the arena opened in 2010, it was lauded as one of the best in the world, winning both \"Best New Major Concert Venue\" in the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards and \"Best NHL Arena\" in the Sports Business Journal reader poll. Populous, formerly HOK Sport, designers of PNC Park and Acrisure Stadium, designed the building working with local architect Astorino and Oxford Development oversaw the building of the arena. More than a dozen buildings were razed in order to create CONSOL Energy Center. PNC Park PNC Park, home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, opened in spring 2001. It is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks-rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field-with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort. Its prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the Downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also oriented to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond. The facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. of Kansas City, Missouri. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh. PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line. PNC Park is named as America's Best Ballpark by TripAdvisor and ESPN.com and among the \"Top Ten Best Ballparks in the nation\" by FOX Sports.

Baseball in Pittsburgh The best time to visit Pittsburgh is during baseball season, and an evening in Pittsburgh is best spent at one of the most popular ballparks in all of baseball, PNC Park. With downtown Pittsburgh serving as a scenic backdrop and a dramatic entry via the Roberto Clemente Bridge along the Allegheny River, you'll see why Pittsburghers and visitors love to cheer for the Pittsburgh Pirates. ABC News, TripAdvisor, ESPN and more have named PNC Park as an ultimate site to catch a game with a spectacular view of the Downtown skyline.

Pittsburgh is a green city ‚Äì not just because of our environmentally friendly buildings and city programs, but because of our parks! Hike, bike, hunt, fish, canoe or ride through our beautiful backyard. City Parks The City of Pittsburgh is home to 176 parks, ranging from regional parks to small neighborhood parklets. Schenley Park contains 456 acres of trails, woods, and attractions. A daily destination for university students, professionals, and outdoor enthusiasts, the park also hosts major annual events such as the Vintage Grand Prix and the Pittsburgh Race for the Cure. Visitors of Schenley Park can enjoy lunch and a concert at the Schenley Park Caf√© and Visitor Center, relax on Flagstaff Hill, play a round at the Bob O‚ÄôConnor Golf Course, head to the Schenley Oval Sportsplex for ice skating or summer sports, or take a dip in the swimming pool. The trails offer a refreshing and convenient escape from the city. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy restored the Schenley Park Caf√© and Visitor Center in 2001 and operates the space today with event and culinary partners, Eat'n Park Hospitality Group. In 2005, the Parks Conservancy worked with the City of Pittsburgh to rehabilitate the Phipps Run stream channel that stretches from behind the Visitor Center down to Panther Hollow Lake. Restoration of the Panther Hollow Watershed is continuous, with the goal of restoring Panther Hollow Lake to a water quality that will once again allow for recreational use. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Workman (@sarahq987) Frick Park is known as Pittsburgh‚Äôs woodland park for its extensive trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes‚Äîit‚Äôs an ideal escape from the noise of the city. Enthusiasts love to visit Clayton Hill, where well over 100 species of birds have been recorded. Children flock to the famous Blue Slide Playground and learn about nature at the Frick Environmental Center. The park also features red clay tennis courts, baseball fields, and the only public lawn bowling green in Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed extensive ecological restoration work in Frick Park since the Conservancy‚Äôs first capital project in 2000, the restoration of Reynolds Street gatehouse entrance. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, opened the new Frick Environmental Center to the public in September 2016, and in 2018 it was certified as a Living Building, achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum status. Emerald View Park visitors can enjoy 257 acres of winding trails, wooded hillsides, and surprise vistas. Historic spaces within the park feature picnic areas, playgrounds, ballfields, overlooks, and Depression-era sandstone steps and walls. Thanks to the tireless efforts of groups like the Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, the City of Pittsburgh, and partners in the community, a master plan was created for Emerald View Park, as well as a plan for 19 miles of new trails. Through removal of dumpsites, habitat restoration, trail development and capital improvements, this land has been reclaimed as a park. Efforts outlined in the Master Implementation Plan (2005) and Master Trail Plan (2010) continue, along with beautification along the nearby Grand View Scenic Byway. Future planning efforts between the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, and the City of Pittsburgh ensures that Emerald View Park will continue to thrive and grow. Highland Park features a popular bike track, swimming pool, sand volleyball courts, and the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium. A water filtration plant cleans the water from the main reservoir, and waste water is naturally de-chlorinated in part by a brook which trickles into Lake Carnegie. Beginning with the creation of the Babbling Brook in 2003, the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed several major park improvement projects in Highland Park. The Entry Garden was restored in 2005. In 2006, the Conservancy worked with the City of Pittsburgh to create a series of seasonal pools along Washington Boulevard. These pools provide a unique urban wetland habitat while dramatically reducing the impact of stormwater runoff. Future plans for the park include work on Heth‚Äôs Run, which includes creating a new trail, adding athletic fields, and connecting the park to the Allegheny River. Riverview Park is a jewel of Pittsburgh‚Äôs North Side. Nestled between Perrysville Avenue, Woods Run and Marshall Avenue, the 259-acre park is known for its wooded trails and dramatically steep hillsides. The park‚Äôs extensive network of trails invites hikers, joggers, and the occasional horseback rider into the woods. The park is also home to the landmark Allegheny Observatory, a swimming pool and activities building, and the popular two-mile Riverview Loop. Residents enjoy the park's pool, playground, ball field, shelters and summertime concerts and movies. The Chapel Shelter, a historic picnic shelter that was once a Presbyterian church, was restored by the Parks Conservancy in 2008. Restoration of the building and the surrounding landscape included creation of a new trail, plantings of numerous native trees and shrubs, and clearing invasive species. Future plans for the park include restoring the historic Watson‚Äôs Cabin and continuing restoration of the Snyder‚Äôs Point natural area. Waterfront Parks Thirteen miles of Downtown Pittsburgh's riverfront park system interconnect to form Three Rivers Park, featuring more than 800 acres of open space for the general public to enjoy. Current boundaries are marked by the West End Bridge over the Ohio River, the 31st Street Bridge over the Allegheny River and the Hot Metal Bridge over the Monongahela River. North Shore Riverfront Park shows off one of the city's greatest examples of revitalization, attracting joggers, cyclists and boaters to the area surrounding the beauty of Heinz Field and PNC Park. On the other side of the Allegheny is the David L. Lawrence Convention Center Riverfront Plaza, which provides a passageway from Point State Park to the Strip District and gives people a place to gather in front of the largest \"green\" building in the world. A five-acre parking lot dating back to the days of Pittsburgh's heavy industrial age was replaced with flood-resistant plants, water-access steps and improved infrastructure to create the Mon Wharf Landing. Across the Monongahela is the South Shore Riverfront Park, located at the popular SouthSide Works complex. The park features a piazza, boat dock and concert stage and serves as an important connection for the Great Allegheny Passage and Three Rivers Heritage Trail.

Downtown Church of the Epiphany The Church of the Epiphany, a Roman Catholic church designed in 1902 by architect Edward Stotz, was designed in the form of an Italian Romanesque basilica, and built of redbrick with terra cotta trim. The interior decoration, which includes frescoes, was designed by John Comes, a principal designer of Catholic churches in the Pittsburgh area at the time. The church is the center of a complex of four buildings, including a parish house (1902), a school (1910), and the St. Regis Residence (1914). First Lutheran Church Designed by architect Andrew Peebles in 1887-88 and begun while the Allegheny County Courthouse was being completed, the Romanesque style First Lutheran Church reflects the design of the Courthouse with its rusticated stonework and vermilion-tinted mortar. The exterior is dominated by tall gabled roofs and a spire that rises 170 feet. The plan of the church is in the form of a Greek cross, which gives it a centralized character. The white plaster walls are broken with three tall windows; the window in the north transept (\"The Good Shepherd\") was designed by Frederick Wilson and fabricated by the Tiffany Studios in 1898. The altar, which was installed after 1892, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style, with mosaics. First Presbyterian Church Designed in 1903-1905 by architect Theophilus P. Chandler, the First Presbyterian Church stands on land that was donated to the church in 1787 by the Penn family for religious purposes. The church structure was designed by a Philadelphia architect who ended up designing three Presbyterian churches in Pittsburgh. The exterior design is in the English Gothic style, and its twin-towered facade is reminiscent of Gothic cathedral design. The interior was laid out as a single large rectangular space, with the pulpit at one end and galleries raised along the sides. In this way, the architecture emphasizes the preaching function of the service. There are no full-height piers in the space because the roof is carried on two massive arched wooden trusses that span the length of the church, above the fronts of the galleries. These structurally-daring trusses are encased in elaborately carved woodwork. The ceiling between the arches is borne on hammer truss beams. The curved paneled wall behind the stone pulpit opens to reveal a rear wing that is lined with three levels of Sunday-school classrooms. The rough stone walls on the interior are opened up by significant stained-glass windows. All of the nave windows, except one, were designed and produced by the Tiffany Studios in New York. The large east window, in the Sunday-school wing, is the work of Clayton & Bell, of London, and depicts a \"Jesse Tree\", or genealogy of Christ. The \"west\" window, in the facade of the church, was designed and built by William Willett of Boston. Smithfield United Church This Gothic-style building was designed and built in 1925-26 by one of Pittsburgh's premiere Classical architects, Henry Hornbostel. The mass of the building culminates in a square tower that is capped by an openwork aluminum spire, an early architectural use of aluminum. The Gothic ornament on the exterior is a surface treatment, limited to the exterior stone panels attached to the steel structural frame. The tall, relatively narrow sanctuary at the top of the building is focused on the 18-foot-diameter rose window. The side walls are lined with tall stained-glass windows that depict both the life and teachings of Christ, and the history of this congregation and of the city of Pittsburgh. The interior ornament, like the exterior, is surface ornament dominated by Gothic arches, with plaster fan and groin vaults in the ceiling. St. Mary of Mercy Roman Catholic Church St. Mary's is the newest and smallest of the churches in Downtown Pittsburgh. The church was designed by architect William P. Hutchins in 1936, and stands out by contrast with its neighbors, in its size and its red brick exterior, with Gothic details in stone. St. Mary's has been built out at the sidewalk line, with its entrance located under a simple square tower at its corner. The principal aisle inside the church follows the diagonal axis of the entry toward the altar. The interior is relatively plain and auditorium-like: a modern church interior built before the Second Vatican Council. Trinity Cathedral Designed by architect Gordon Lloyd in1870-71, the church's parish house was designed in 1907 by Crocker & Carpenter. The exterior was designed in the Early Decorated English Gothic Style that was favored by mid-Victorian Episcopalians, with a single central steeple and side transepts. The interior features a tall nave flanked by aisles and lit by clerestory windows. The plaster nave walls are supported by clustered stone columns, and the austere interior ornamentation, in which the pointed arch predominates, is reminiscent of the work of the American Gothicist Richard Upjohn. Some of the stained glass windows in the nave were destroyed in a fire in 1967, and were replaced by new ones in a medieval style. The rest of the windows date from 1872. The carved stone pulpit was built in 1922 to the design of the renowned American architect Bertram G. Goodhue. North Shore Calvary United Methodist Church An historic landmark in one of Pittsburgh's most charming neighborhoods, the Calvary Church is a stunning example of European-inspired architecture and features three magnificently restored, 30-foot Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows. Other features include delicate spires and friendly gargoyles, an elegant wooden ceiling, stunning decoration, and historic Farrand & Votey pipe organ. Emmanuel Episcopal Church Completed in 1886, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also on the North Side, is a classic example of the work of Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is built on property acquired in 1882 from Macher Warfield -- a cousin of Wallis Warfield, later the Duchess of Windsor. The church's decor includes a \"reredos\" an impressive ornamental screen behind the altar featuring stained glass angels, mosaics and marble statues. Oakland Heinz Memorial Chapel It is a place where people find serenity and discover the joy of celebration. Crafted of limestone and solid oak, this Neo-Gothic masterwork instantly captivates in a panorama of vaulted ceilings, soaring arches, and more than 250,000 individual pieces of exquisite stained glass. For over a century, Heinz Memorial Chapel has been the Pittsburgh destination for dream weddings, special concerts, guided tours and quiet reflection. Saint Paul's Cathedral Saint Paul's Cathedral was opened in 1906 at its present site on Fifth Avenue in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Designed by Egan and Prindeville of Chicago and built by Thomas Reilly, a general contractor from Philadelphia, Saint Paul's is an example of the Scholastic, or Decorated, Gothic style of the 14th Century. The building rises 247 feet with a statue of Saint Paul mounted on the center pediment. Other exterior statues depict the apostles and evangelists of the Eastern and Western Church. While the overall proportions of the structure are not true to the classic cathedrals of Europe, Saint Paul Cathedral fits the site and (as the cathedrals of old) reflects their spirit and historical significance.

There are multiple theaters and so much history to be seen at each one. Benedum Center for the Performing Arts Pittsburgh''s 2,885 seat Benedum Center is the result of a $42 million restoration and expansion of the Stanley Theatre, built in 1928 as \"a movie palace version of Versailles.\" This one-time vaudeville hall has been renovated with grand style. Every detail-from the 500,000-piece crystal chandelier to the gilded plasterwork-has been restored or replicated and after its two-year renovation, it looks as it did on opening night in 1928. The signature piece of the Benedum Center, the original main chandelier, weighs 4,700 pounds and measures 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The Grand Lobby mirrors, marble and woodwork are all original, and at the landing on each staircase in the Grand Lobby are 18-foot high original mirrors meant to be reminiscent of the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Byham Theater Originally built in 1903 as the Gayety Theater, the Byham Theater opened on Halloween night, 1904. It ran for many years as one of the country''s foremost stage and vaudeville houses, with appearances from such stars as Ethel Barrymore, Gertrude Lawrence and Helen Hayes. In the 1930s, the theater was renamed The Fulton and became a full-time movie theater. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust purchased the theater in 1990 and following the first of four planned phases of renovation, the Fulton was reopened in May 1991. It was later renamed the Byham Theater through a naming gift from the Byham family following the second phase of renovation in 1995. The Gayety boasted pressed copper cherubs painted with a bronze patina, imitation gold leaf, stained glass windows, plaster columns and wainscot of scagolia, an Italian faux marble technique. In the entry vestibule, note the original mosaic tile floor and the many bare light bulbs lining the ceiling, evidence of the advent of electrical lighting. The old lighted Fulton marquee was restored by the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. The second phase of renovations brought new restrooms, box office, marquee, an elevator, lobby improvements and facade changes. In 1997, the Cherub Lobby was restored to its original splendor. Heinz Hall This restored 1926 movie theater's architecture now serves as the backdrop for much of Pittsburgh's cultural activity. It's the crown jewel of venues in Pittsburgh's Cultural District and has an international reputation for grandeur and excellence as a concert hall and showplace. The 2,661-seat world-class venue is home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which performs 30 concerts in the Hall annually. Despite several renovations over the years, much of the basic architecture of the building has remained unchanged from its original French Court style. In the Hall's beautiful lobby, ornate Italian marble shines and baroque relief, shimmering crystal lights and exquisite chandeliers provide the allure for an evening of stage and show. Breche opal and Lavanto marble, plush red velvet and shimmering crystal are the main elements in the decoration of the interior of the Hall and 24-karat gold leaf detailing is seen throughout. O'Reilly Theater The O'Reilly is the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's only newly constructed theater. It was created with two purposes: to create a Downtown home for the Pittsburgh Public Theater and add an additional venue for theater, music and other performances. Designed by world-renowned architect Michael Graves, the O'Reilly Theater is the only downtown performance venue that features a thrust stage, surrounded by the audience on three sides. Its aesthetic is signature Graves-smooth, polished, pared-down and classic. The theater's wood is all curly maple, with the sensuous grain producing the primary decorative effect. Built at a cost of $25 million, the 650-seat capacity, state-of-the-art theater officially opened in December of 1999.

Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit. Downtown Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle. BNY Mellon Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away. Fort Pitt Block House The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet. Frick Building The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919. Fifth Avenue Place Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter. Gulf Tower Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline, the Gulf Tower beacon glows different colors according to weather conditions. Built as the headquarters for the Gulf Oil Company, the structure was completed in 1932. The crown of the skyscraper is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in the style of the step pyramid. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 1973. K&L Gates Center K&L Gates Center is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of downtown Pittsburgh. The building, long known as One Oliver Plaza and briefly as FreeMarkets Center and Ariba Center, was completed in 1968, has 39 floors and rises 511 feet above downtown Pittsburgh. Omni William Penn Hotel Built in 1916, this grand hotel boasts a history as one of the architectural centerpieces in downtown Pittsburgh. Unique features include the historic filigreed arches cradling the main lobby space, elegant lanterns that once again grace the sidewalk. Enlarged in 1929 by architect Benno Janssen and his partners, the hotel lobby has Old World elegance, with its potted palms, crystal chandeliers and classical music. The hotel's finest room, however, is on the 17th floor -- the Art Deco ballroom designed by New York architect Joseph Urban. The hotel is the last of four buildings in three adjacent blocks commissioned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who sometimes reserved the Presidential suite for his own use. Oxford Centre One Oxford Centre is actually a complex of six buildings, all of matching glass and steel design. Completed in 1983, One Oxford Centre has 46 floors in its main tower and rises 615 feet about Downtown. The tower has nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and high-end retail space. At night, 43 spotlights illuminate the Centre with a total of 55,000 watts that create a glowing effect said to be greater than any other high-rise in the U.S. The building is designed the way it is, with so many sides, because the developers wanted as many corner offices in it as possible. PNC/Fairmont Tower Headquartered in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group is one of the nation's largest financial services companies. Three PNC/Fairmont is a 23-story skyscraper and is one of the nation's largest mixed-use LEED-certified green buildings. It's also the site of one of the largest \"living walls\" in North America. Included is the green 185-room Fairmont Pittsburgh Hotel, as well as 28 luxury condos. The company is at work on The Tower at PNC Plaza, which is expected to be the world's largest green high-rise. PPG Place Beautiful PPG Place is the headquarters for PPG Industries, Inc. and perhaps the most distinctive building in Pittsburgh's picturesque skyline. PPG Place, a large building complex including a 40-story tower (635 feet) with five satellite buildings that cover a six city block area, was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. The large urban complex was in part inspired by two existing architectural landmarks in Pittsburgh, the Cathedral of Learning in the University of Pittsburgh's campus and H.H. Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse. In PPG Place, Johnson made loose use of Gothic architectural vocabulary, translating it into modern materials and construction techniques. PPG Place stands perhaps as one of Johnson's buildings that best demonstrate his wit and affinity for mixed messages. By mixing historical forms with modern methods of construction, Johnson created a post-modernist building which is truly unique, in part due to its use of materials, which were immensely appropriate since PPG is a leading manufacturer of curtain wall assemblies. Union Trust Building Formerly known as the Union Arcade (1915-1917). The architect of this Flemish Gothic fantasy was Pittsburgher Frederick J. Osterling, who had enlarged Frick's Point Breeze home two decades earlier. It is Frick's answer to the then-new Woolworth Building in New York City, the world's tallest. When it opened, it was Pittsburgh's most sumptuous shopping mall, although its four floors of shops have been reduced to one. Step inside, walk to the center and look up into the delicate lace of the stained glass dome. U.S. Steel Tower Designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, the world headquarters of the U.S. Steel Corporation was completed in 1971. During the initial planning stages, the U.S. Steel Corporation seriously considered making this development the world's tallest building. The tower's shape, mirroring the shape of Downtown Pittsburgh, is a triangle with indented corners. It was the first building to use liquid-fireproofed columns. At the time of its completion this was the world's tallest building outside of New York and Chicago, and is still the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 64 stories. When its construction was completed in 1971, the building was considered to be an engineering masterpiece. The Tower is home to the global headquarters for both the U.S. Steel Corporation and UPMC, a leader in innovative health care practices and a health insurance provider. Mt. Washington Chatham Village Built in the early 1930s, Chatham Village is a model planned community with rowhouses, garden courts, greenbelt and recreation facilities opened through the Buhl Foundation to promote social reforms and housing improvements for middle-income families. This influenced the development of 20th century urban planning in the US. Oakland Cathedral of Learning The Cathedral of Learning is the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in Oakland. Standing at 535 feet, the 42-story Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere and the second tallest in the world. The Cathedral was commissioned in 1921 and finished in 1937, and has 2,529 windows. Nationality Rooms The first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning are home to 29 Nationality Rooms. As gifts to the University of Pittsburgh from the city's ethnic communities, these 30 unique classrooms take you on a voyage of world cultures and global traditions. Witness designs that range from Byzantine and Classical to Renaissance and Romanesque. Step inside Beijing, Damascus, Athens and more to hear each room's unique story without having set foot outside Pittsburgh.

Fallingwater Called \"The best all-time work of American architecture\" by the American Institute of Architects, and named one of \"50 Places of a Lifetime\" by National Geographic, Fallingwater is located 90 minutes south of Pittsburgh in the idyllic Laurel Highlands. The house is dramatically cantilevered over a waterfall and widely considered to be Wright's most sublime integration of man and nature. Fallingwater is open daily, except for Wednesday, mid-March through November. In-depth, self-guided grounds and children's tours available. Advanced ticket purchase or reservations are essential. Share Your Story On Social #LOVEPGH Duncan House Wright-designed Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort is nestled deep in the heart of the Laurel Highlands in Acme, Pa., about 90 minutes from Pittsburgh. It is one of only four Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the U.S. that offers overnight lodging. The house's floor plan includes Wright's trademark open living/dining area with a natural stone fireplace as its focal point. Recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry and geometric styling are obvious throughout the home. Natural colors and fabrics are used to reflect Wright's dedication to the preservation of nature and its integration with indoor spaces. Polymath Park Resort is situated on more than 100 tranquil and scenic wooded acres including miles of hiking trails and a peaceful reflecting pond. The Duncan House Polymath Park Resort is just 15 miles from Fallingwater and 30 miles from Kentuck Knob.

Kentuck Knob Two-thousand glorious feet above the Youghiogheny River sits yet another Frank Lloyd Wright masterwork. Settled in the crest of the hill-this culmination of organic architecture and elegant living space makes the home appear as if it were one with the mountain. Tidewater red cypress and native fieldstone are its core elements. A completely functional kitchen is central to the foundations architectural design, while stonewalls anchor this privately owned residence. The rest of the open floor plan utilizes cantilevered overhangs and a great expanse of glass that make you feel as though you're one with nature. A large outdoor sculpture garden is also present on the grounds. M√§ntyl√§ House The newest addition to the Frank Lloyd Wright collection in the Laurel Highlands is the M√§ntyl√§ House in Polymouth Park.

Introduction to Pittsburgh Easily navigable waterways with an abundance of natural resources, (coal, timber, natural gas, iron and limestone) helped Pittsburgh become the industrial center for a growing nation. Most people recognize one thing about Pittsburgh's history, that it was known as an industrial hub for coal mining and steel production. Pittsburgh has played an important part in U.S. history from the early days of the French and Indian War (1758), to the Revolutionary War (1776), to the infamous Whiskey Rebellion (1791) and the American Civil War (1860s) with its secretive Underground Railroad stops. The Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand. With his introduction of the Bessemer steel making process, Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie, completed his rise from obscurity to become the richest man in the world. Carnegie began steel production in 1875. Henry Clay Frick, grandson of western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers, made his fortune building and operating beehive coking ovens where coal was turned into coke, a necessary raw material in steel making. Soon, the two men came together to form the Carnegie Steel Co. In 1901, Carnegie and Frick merged several companies into United States Steel Corp. The history of America's labor union movement added some dark days during the Homestead Steel Strike and subsequent armed conflict of the Battle of Homestead. From these dark days, though, grew modern labor practices and laws to protect workers. While the riverfront steel mills of the Mon Valley are mostly gone now, the generosity of industrial giants like Carnegie and Frick, food manufacturer H.J. Heinz, and banker/financier Andrew Mellon lives on in a legacy of art, culture and education in Pittsburgh. What remained are the Frick family home, known as Clayton, as well as a masterful art collection. Andrew Carnegie's generous public donations included The Carnegie Library, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Institute of Technology (known today as Carnegie Mellon University). Up through the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for nearly half of national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a half million with European immigration via Ellis Island. Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retains an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history. Even though Pittsburgh faced rough times in the 1970s and 80s when steel production all but disappeared from its landscape, it has since re-invented itself as a hub for education, medicine, small manufacturing and research. Of course, having extremely successful sports teams has enhanced the city's reputation. The black and gold of all three of its professional teams, Steelers (NFL), Pirates (MLB) and Penguins (NHL) are synonymous with the pride local residents have in its sports teams and the city they represent. Today Pittsburgh welcomes visitors from around the globe. Its strengths lie in its authenticity as an all-American city, and its genuine, hard-working and welcoming sense of community that has transformed it into one of the most surprisingly beautiful and progressive cities in the USA.

It was broad in its reach, encompassing the United States and beyond, and profound in its meaning for a nation entwined in the sale of human life. Yet, that history, by its very secretive nature, is a difficult one to reveal. What was the Underground Railroad? Western Pennsylvania was a major thoroughfare for enslaved peoples seeking freedom. They followed routes that were carved by nature in rivers, streams and mountains, traveling mostly on foot, with an occasional ride in hidden compartments of wagons and other forms of transportation. Their numbers are not certain as formal records were not kept and few informal ones remain. Some documents written by those who assisted‚Äîsometimes referred to as the \"conductors\"‚Äîin this underground process have survived, giving some indication of what those traveling on the railroad endured. Some publications written by, or for, those who managed to survive to secure their freedom also exist. Free people of African decent who lived in the area were also affected by the Fugitive Slave Laws, fleeing their homes as they faced the possibility of becoming enslaved. Still others became the voice of social change and self-empowerment for all Blacks of the era and beyond. The history is unique and boundless. Explore more than 250 years of African-American history in the Senator John Heinz History Center's exhibition, From Slavery to Freedom, which highlights the history of the anti-slavery movement, the Underground Railroad and the impact of 19th-centurty activism on the quest for civil rights in Pittsburgh. One of the many Underground Railroad routes in western Pennsylvania came in through Uniontown in Fayette County, then traveled through Blairsville in Indiana County before continuing into Mercer, Venango and Erie Counties. The Blairsville Area Underground Railroad Project provides tours of the town and cemetery and UGRR-related sites, including the Underground Railroad Museum. Western Pennsylvania Underground Railroad Sites Bigham House on Mt. Washington Chatham VillageOlympia RoadMt. Washington, PA 15211 Built in 1849, a stop on the Underground Railroad, located within Chatham Village. Thomas James Bigham was an abolitionist lawyer and the editor of The Commercial Journal Anti-Slavery Newspaper. Tradition states that Bigham's Black family nurse, Lucinda, faithfully watched from the tower of the Bigham home for fugitive slaves or professional slave hunters. Not a visitor attraction, but available for group tours upon request. Learn more from wesa.fm story. City Baths Barbershop and safehouse located on Third Street between Market and Ferry Streets in downtown Pittsburgh. Slaves received a new appearance and a start on their escape to Canada. Historians have compared lists of prominent hotel guests with ads placed by people looking for escaped slaves to confirm the hotel's place in abolitionist history. By day, a business, social and political club for the city's white leaders, by night, a station on the Underground Railroad. Freedom Road Cemetery Mercer County Historical Society119 South Pitt St.Mercer, PA 16137724.662.3490 This cemetery is located on the right across from the main gate at Stoneboro Fairgrounds. The cemetery is all that remains of Liberia, a fugitive slave town established by the Travis family, free Blacks. For years, this community offered sanctuary to weary travelers. It was also the site of frequent raids by slave catchers. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1849/50, most of the population fled to Canada to become legal free citizens. A few stayed in this area, one an entrepreneur who sold cigars and whiskey to his neighbors. Gibson House (Mark Twain Manor) Jamestown Future Foundation210 Liberty St.Jamestown, PA 16134724.932.5455 Dr. William Gibson, a prominent Jamestown physician, traveled with Samuel Clemens to Russia. Clemens wrote a book on their travels called Innocents Abroad. The house has been rumored to be a stop on the Underground Railroad. In the basement, there is evidence of a small room used in the Underground Railroad. There is now a restaurant in this building. The Gibson House is on the National Register of Historic Places. John C. Peck Oyster House Fourth Street between Wood and Market, downtown Pittsburgh An Underground Railroad station stop. Plaque Honoring Jane Gray Swisshelm 600 Grant St., downtown Pittsburgh Located at the Heinz headquarters on Sixth Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh. Jane Grey Swisshelm witnessed slavery firsthand and became dedicated to the abolition movement for the Underground Railroad. Her abolitionist weekly, the Pittsburgh Saturday Visitor, first appeared in 1848. Private homes in Arthurville and Hayti Lower Hill District, Pittsburgh Fugitives were secreted in private homes in the predominantly Black section of Arthurville and Hayti and were aided by agents and conductors including the Rev. Lewis Woodson, Samuel Bruce, George Gardner and Bishop Benjamin Tanner, the father of the noted black artist Henry Ossawa Tanner, who is portrayed on a U.S. postage stamp. St. Matthew's A.M.E. Church in Sewickley 345 Thorn St., Sewickley Built in 1857 in Sewickley, served as operators on the Underground Railroad. One frequently-used method for delivering food to fugitive slaves in the Pittsburgh area was for conductors to dress as hunters at night with a game bag filled with provisions. Wylie A.M.E. Church 2200 Wylie Ave., Hill District July 11, 1850, a group of African American citizens met at the church and passed resolutions condemning the recently proposed Fugitive Slave Bill. Members of this gathering called for total consolidation of their associations to ensure protection from slave catchers coming into Pittsburgh seeking fugitives. Demolished Sites Allegheny Institute and Mission Church Later known as Avery College, then as Avery Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church at Nash and Avery Streets. Charles A. Avery came to Pittsburgh in 1812. His interest in the cotton industry took him on buying trips to the South, and he was drawn to the plight of the Negro slaves. Joining the abolitionist forces, he aided the escape of slaves from the South to Canada in the underground railroad. The Allegheny Institute and Mission Church, later known as Avery College, built with funds from Mr. Avery's fortune, was a three-story structure heavily influenced by the Greek Revival architecture being used in many eastern cities at that time. The basement, accessible by hidden trap doors, was most probably a \"station\" (hiding place) in the secret Underground Railroad. A tunnel from the church's basement led to a former canal nearby, permitting fugitive slaves to be dropped by boat from the Allegheny River. A rowboat was used to secretly move them up the canal at night to the tunnel entrance. The first and second floors were used for education, and the third floor for religious purposes. When Avery died, his fortune was estimated at $800,000. Among the bequests was $20,000 for Oberlin College, the first college in the United States to admit Blacks. Workmen demolished the red brick building of Avery College in Old Allegheny's Dutchtown to make way for the much disputed highway through the East Street Valley. Outside of a few sentimental old-timers, nobody noticed the demolition of the old structure. But to the old-timers, the passing of the building meant the end of a prominent Pittsburgher's dream. Crawford Grill A center of Black social life, located in the Hill District, where musicians such as Art Blakey, Mary Lou Williams and John Coltrane drew a racially mixed, international clientele. Owned by William \"Gus\" Greenlee, a powerful figure in politics and sports in Pittsburgh's Black community, who owned the Pittsburgh Crawfords, the city's Negro League baseball team. Monongahela House Demolished hotel, once located at the corner of Water and Smithfield Streets. One of the city's finest hotels and a center of anti-slavery activity. Its staff included 300 free Blacks that had daily contact with a flow of wealthy Southern businessmen who came north and east. Point View Hotel Family-owned historic bar and restaurant on Brownsville Road in Brentwood, that once served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Runaway slaves stayed in the basement.

Wonderful for names like Jimmy Stewart and Fred Rogers, great actors of their time who got their start right here in western Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh raves about other famous sons and daughters like Joe Montana, Christina Aguilera, Gene Kelly and Andy Warhol. These and many others have made Pittsburgh proud. William ‚Äã‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Strayhorn (1915‚Äì1967) Born in Ohio but is more often associated with Pittsburgh, where he spent a larger part of his childhood. Was friendly throughout his life with Lena Horne, another transplanted Pittsburgher. For three decades was the composing and arranging partner of jazz great Duke Ellington. Met Ellington in 1939 outside the Stanley Theater, now the Benedum Center; where the bandleader hired him immediately and the two worked together until Strayhorn died in 1967. His compositions alone or with Ellington include \"Lush Life,\" \"Chelsea Bridge,\" \"Johnny Come Lately,\" \"A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing\" and \"Satin Doll.\" His most famous composition, \"Take the 'A' Train,\" was inspired by the subway directions to Ellington's home for their first meeting. Condition/Architectural Notes Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) marker Warner Brothers Harry, Sam, Albert and Jack Warner hailed from Ohio but made a name for themselves by opening the first silent movie nickelodeon in downtown New Castle in 1907. Granddaugher Cass Warner today holds a film festival in New Castle and has started the Harry M. Warner Film Institute at Slippery Rock University. The Vogues Harmony-pop vocal group formed in 1960 by lead baritone Bill Burkette, baritone Don Miller, first tenor Hugh Geyer, and second tenor Chuck Blasko, who were all high school friends from Turtle Creek. Originally dubbed the Val-Aires, the foursome eventually reached the number four spot in the autumn of 1965 with \"You're the One.\" Most memorable hit, the classic \"Five O'Clock World,\" cracked the Top Five. Two more Top 40 entries, \"Magic Town\" and \"The Land of Milk and Honey,\" followed in 1966. Resurfaced in 1968 with the Top Ten smash \"Turn Around, Look at Me.\" The single, the Vogues' lone million-seller, anticipated the lighter, more sophisticated approach of subsequent hits like \"My Special Angel,\" \"Till,\" and \"No, Not Much.\" Various Vogues lineups continue touring oldies circuits. The Skyliners Pittsburgh vocal group made it big with a magnificent heartache ballad in 1959, \"Since I Don't Have You,\" among R&B's greatest hits. Led by vocalist Jimmy Beaumont, with Janet Vogel, Wally Lester, Joe VerScharen, and Jackie Taylor. Legend has it that Janet ad libbed the song's memorable ending in high C (after repeating thirteen \"you's\") as a joke during rehersals. The group liked it so much they made it a permanent part of their arrangement. More than a dozen labels rejected the song before it was released by a local Pittsburgh label, Calico Records. Their follow-up, \"This I Swear,\" peaked at number 20 on the R&B charts. In recent years, The Skyliners created not one, but two Christmas standards. The group's version of the Beaumont/Rock compositions \"You're My Christmas Present\" and \"Another Lonely New Year's Eve\" are not only heard across America each holiday season, but have been included on a number of holiday compact disc collections. The ensemble was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002. The Mellon Family Andrew W. Mellon expertly invested money into multiple industrial and financial ventures including steel, aluminum, coal, utilities, railroads, banks, and more. Developed his father‚Äôs bank into Mellon National Bank which aided in the transformation of Pittsburgh into an industrial giant. Mellon Institute for Industrial Research was created by A.W. and brother Richard in 1909 in an effort to fund research in promotion of better business and scientific practices. A private man who kept his early philanthropy quiet, like canceling small debts for Christmas and purchasing food and clothing for people in Pittsburgh. Named Secretary of the Treasury in 1921 and served as Secretary for Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, cutting the national debt with what was known as the \"Mellon Plan\" and authored the book Taxation: The People‚Äôs Business. Resigned in 1932 and accepted the position of U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain for one year. After retirement, began his largest philanthropic quest, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Collected works while Secretary but solidified his plans with the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust in 1930. Following the announcement of the Gallery, personal collection neared 350 pieces from which 121 paintings and twenty-one sculptures were added to the Gallery collection. Also established a trust to fund the Gallery, donating $10 million, as well as giving an estimated $21 million in art and $15 million for the construction of the Gallery building.The grand opening occurred in 1941 after his death. The legacy of A.W. Mellon remains with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation philanthropic trust formed in 1969 through the merger of the Avalon Foundation (est. 1940 by Ailsa Mellon Bruce) and the Old Dominion Foundation (est. 1941 by Paul Mellon). Prior to the merger, the Avalon Foundation distributed funds to hospitals and health agencies, educational institutions, and cultural programs including the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. The Old Dominion Fund concentrated on the humanities and liberal education. The merged foundation, with assets of $3.4 billion (1998), continues to support the areas of health, education and the humanities and has added programs in conservation, public affairs and population studies. The Lettermen Founding member Tony Butala began singing professionally as a boy in Sharon and by the age of eight appeared on Pittsburgh's KDKA Radio. Moved to Hollywood to become a member of the famous Mitchell Boys Choir, appearing in motion pictures, television and radio and concert tours. In the mid-fifties, while still in high school in Hollywood, Butala formed The Fourmost, a vocal group of three ex-Mitchell Boy Choir friends and a female classmate, Concetta Ingolia. After moderate local success, Ingolia exited the group to be cast in a new TV series, \"Hawaiian Eye,\" and chose the stage name Connie Stevens. By 1960, The Lettermen‚Äînow Butala, Jim Pike and Bob Engemann‚Äîwere signed to Warner Brothers Records and released their first single: \"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring.\" In 1961, Capitol Records signed them to what turned out to be an over twenty-five year contract. The Lettermen first hit the music charts in 1961 with \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" Following that first hit with another chart topper, \"When I Fall In Love.\" Made \"Theme From A Summer Place,\" \"Smile,\" \"Our Winter Love,\" \"Come Back Silly Girl\" and \"Graduation Day.\" Late 1967 made perhaps their most loved and requested hit: the medley of \"Goin' Out Of My Head / Can't Take My Eyes Off You.\" In 1967, Engemann left the group and was replaced by Jim's younger brother, Gary Pike. Hits continued with \"Up, Up And Away,\" \"Hurt So Bad,\" \"Shangri-La,\" \"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\" and \"Love.\" In 1973, when Jim left the group, the youngest Pike brother Donny took over and hits like: \"Cherish / Precious and Few,\" \"World Without Love,\" \"If You Feel The Way I Do,\" \"Feelings,\" \"What I Did For Love,\" and Donny's own \"Thank You Girl.\" Throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s, The Lettermen continued to release albums and travel the world, performing hundreds of concerts each year. The current Lettermen consist of Tony Butala (the group's only original member), Donovan Scott Tea (an accomplished singer and songwriter who joined the group in 1984) and Darren Dowler (a young actor, singer, impressionist who came aboard in 1995). The year 2000 marked the group's 40th Anniversary. Butala created the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in Sharon, dedicated to honor the greatest vocal groups in the world. The Heinz Family Howard Heinz, son of founder H.J. Heinz, bequeathed his residual estate to the Howard Heinz Endowment for philanthropic purposes. Today thanks to the largesse of both Howard and Vira Heinz Endowments, a variety of arts and culture, social service, healthcare, environmental, economic development and educational services thrive in Pittsburgh and around the world. Henry Heinz II was an active community leader with intense interest in the arts worked toward citywide revival and the creation of a downtown Pittsburgh cultural district. In 1971, together with funding from the Heinz family, oversaw the creation of Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Founded the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in 1984. Spearheaded the creation of the Heinz Gallery, located in the Carnegie Museum of Art, in 1988, and the development of the Benedum Center, a two-year restoration of Pittsburgh's historic Stanley Theater. His son, the late Senator John Heinz, as chairman of the Heinz Charitable and Family Trust and trustee of the Howard and Vira Heinz Endowment, continued the Heinz family tradition of combining entrepreneurial skill with community activism. Stephen Foster Famous for writing songs like \"Oh! Susannah\" (1848), \"Camptown Races\" (1850), \"Old Folks at Home\" (1851), \"My Old Kentucky Home\" (1853) and \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\" (1854). Not understanding his musical talent, his pioneer family provided little formal musical education. His knowledge of African Americans was drawn from minstrel shows for which many of his songs were written. Feeling that prejudice against these 'Ethiopian songs' existed, he was at first unwilling to risk his reputation by having his name appear on them. Had little aptitude for business, and his income was never commensurate with the popularity of his songs. Excessive drinking and extreme poverty ruined his last years. He died in Bellevue Hospital, New York City. Buried in Allegheny Cemetery, Section 21, Lot 30. Stanley Turrentine Born to a musical family, father Thomas played tenor saxophone, mother played piano, brother Tommy the trumpet and brother Marvin drums. Stanley played tenor sax, mixing jazz with blues, rock, rhythm and blues and pop. In the 50's, played with Lowell Fulson, Earl Bostic, and Max Roach's bands. In the 1960s, worked with organist Jimmy Smith and made many soul jazz recordings both with Smith and as a leader. Had his biggest hit \"Sugar\" in 1970. Then turned to jazz fusion, but returned to soul jazz in the 80's and 90's. Career began in Pittsburgh and came back to his roots for his final journey. Buried in Allegheny Cemetery, Section 26, Lot 722. Stan Musial One of the game's great hitters, St. Louis Cardinal \"Stan the Man\" won the National League batting championship seven times (1943, 1946, 1948, 1950‚Äì52, 1957) and the league's Most Valuable Player award three times (1943, 1946, 1948). In 1963 retired with a lifetime batting average of .331. Hit 475 home runs and for many years held the National League record for base hits (3,630). Elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Shirley Jones Shirley grew up in Smithton, PA, where grandfather William B. Jones founded the Jones Brewery in 1907 that's still in operation. She was a gifted child with natural singing ability, studied under Ralph Lewando, one of Pittsburgh's top vocal coaches. After graduating from South Huntingdon High School, she was spotted by a scout photographer for The 1952 Miss Pittsburgh Pageant and went on to compete for the title of Miss Pennsylvania. The prize was a two year scholarship to the drama school at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She planned to go on to college but instead went to New York City in the summer of 1953. There she was discovered by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein who cast her as Laurie in the 1955 movie version of their hit stage musical Oklahoma! Later Shirley played the same role on Broadway and established a career in both theater and the movies, including the musicals The Music Man (1962) and Carousel (1956). The actress won a 1960 Academy Award for her portrayal of a prostitute in the film Elmer Gantry. From 1970-74, starred on the TV show The Partridge Family as Shirley Partridge, the mother of a rock act who also sang in the band and co-starred her real-life stepson, early '70s heartthrob David Cassidy. She was married to actors Jack Cassidy from 1956-74, and Marty Ingles. Sharon Stone A cool blonde who combined brainy sex appeal and old-fashioned Hollywood glamour, was one of Hollywood's biggest stars during the 1990s. Born and raised in Meadville, she won a college scholarship at 15 before graduating from high school. Attended Edinboro University near Erie and studied creative writing and fine arts. Dropped out and worked as a $500 a day model at the Eileen Ford Agency. Turned to acting in the late 70's and began in B-movies like King Solomon's Mines (1985) and Police Academy 4 (1987).

Later created seven philanthropic and educational organizations in the United States, including Carnegie Corporation of New York.
