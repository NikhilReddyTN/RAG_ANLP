Her cast of zany southern characters and parody country music songs have pushed her to the top of the Spotify and Apple Music charts, earning her a cumulative following of 3.6M+ followers and nearly 2 billion views.\nDanae's debut Country/Comedy single \"Rode Hard\" peaked at No. 5 on the Country Global iTunes Charts, No. 8 on Billboard’s Country Digital Song Sales, No. 22 on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales, and No. 34 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists.\nEarlier this year, Danae wrapped her debut comedy tour, which sold out in minutes. The tour has been extended through the end of the year and transitioned theaters. Danae and her wife, Mandie Kaii, host the weekly podcast calledThe Refined and Rowdy Show, where humor, heart and contrasting perspectives collide as they discuss everything from pop culture to heated issues. The podcast — which launched in Fall 2023 — just recently surpassed 1 million listeners.\nTrue to her multi-hyphenate nature, Danae's passion for acting landed her a role in \"Mother Nature and the Doomsday Prepper\" (which she just returned from filming in the spring of 2024) and \"Summer Camp\". Additionally, Danae has co-and-guest starred alongside many of the most notable names in entertainment including Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Tanya Christiansen and Josh Peck.\nContact Us412-566-4190Email Us\nPittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222\nShare this page"

        "full_description": "\n“…a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.” — Jazz Times\nThroughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 Grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success.The Yellowjackets formed in the late 1970’s as the backup band for guitarist Robben Ford. They recorded their first album together in 1980. Shortly after that recording, however, Ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. As a result, the modern day Yellowjackets were formed — a trio with Russell Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Ricky Lawson. Since then, and with the addition of Bob Mintzer, the Yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz’s most influential and loved groups.\nOver the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. Never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the Yellowjackets - Russell Ferrante, William Kennedy, Bob Mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music.The most recent addition to the band adds Australian bass player Dane Alderson into the mix. With his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, Dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music.The Yellowjackets album “Raising Our Voice\" was released in Fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist Luciana Souza. Their album \"Jackets XL with the WDR Big Band\" was nominated for a Grammy® in 2021.\nTheir latest album \"Parallel Motion\" (2022) also received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. Consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime.\nContact Us412-566-4190Email Us\nPittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222\nShare this page"

Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.\nDirected by Matthew Rankin\n2024 | Canada | Farsi and French language with English subtitles | DCP\nContact Us412-566-4190Email Us\nPittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222\nShare this page"

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.\nDirected by Bruce David Klein\n2024 | USA | English language | DCP\nContact Us412-566-4190Email Us\nPittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222\nShare this page"

The show is a hilarious and profoundly beautiful plunge into the underworld of those who use and abuse the powers of deception.\nOur tour guide, Ben Seidman combines sleight of hand and psychological deception to cheat at cards, pick your pockets, and demonstrate the importance of using our powers for good. At its core, Good Charlatan questions the existence of free will and reimagines how one simple lie can unfold into a spiral of truth.\nBen Seidman guest-starred on the Netflix series Brainchild, produced by Pharrell, and starred in both Vanity Fair and WIRED’s “Experts React” series, discussing magic, sleight of hand, and pickpocketing. Ben appeared in the Vanderpump Rules Season 9 premiere, starred in two specials on Travel Channel, and appeared twice on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. While known for large events, Ben also creates amazement at small private parties, including performances for Christina Aguilera, Woody Harrelson, and Zedd. He has dazzled CEOs, senators, and the late-great Robin Williams.\nSeidman was the only person in history to be named the Resident Magician at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. He was awarded the Princess Cruises “Entertainer of the Year” award and consulted on three seasons of Mindfreak on A&E, designing illusions for Criss Angel. Seidman taught magic to Johnny Knoxville and consulted on multiple feature films in the Jackass franchise. Internationally, he wrote and directed magic for SVT, the biggest TV channel in Sweden. Ben lives in Los Angeles with his wife Sarah and his dog Juno.\nContact Us412-566-4190Email Us\nPittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222\nShare this page"
