William J. Holland, then the museum’s director, stated in an editorial appearing in Volume 1, Number 1, ofAnnals of Carnegie Museum: “The publication of the observations and discoveries of those, who form the staff of a well-organized museum, has always been recognized as a proper function of such an institution…. For the purpose of facilitating the diffusion of knowledge gained, often laboriously and at great expense, by those who are directly connected with the museum, as well as to form a medium for the publication of the results of the labors of others, who are associated with them, or are pursuing inquiries along the same, or kindred lines, the Trustees of the Institute have authorized the publication of…[the] Annals….” Today, Carnegie Museum of Natural History has three main publications. All are dedicated to providing the findings of the research of the museum’s staff and their associates to the scientific community: Annals of Carnegie MuseumBulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural HistorySpecial Publications of Carnegie Museum of Natural HistoryMemoirs of the Carnegie Museumwere published 1901–1936.

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh From Collections User To Collections Manager Introducing Mariana Marques, the New Collection Manager for the Section of Amphibians and Reptiles by Mariana Marques I’m not sure when I first entered in a natural history museum, but I know that these establishments have always been my favorite places to visit. I did my bachelor’s degree in biology in the University of Évora, a small and picturesque town in southern Portugal surrounded by one of the most biodiverse habitats of the Iberian Peninsula, the unique savanna-like ecosystem known as the “montado.” In the intervals between classes, I loved to go look for the critters that surrounded the university field station where most of my classes were held. I was lucky enough to be in one of the places with the highest diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the country, and in a natural and unspoiled area which meant that I could easily see good numbers of these animals. Being able to handle and study these animals in the field woke up my passion for herpetology, and I decided that I wanted to become a herpetologist. I started to collaborate on projects in herpetology, and I was lucky enough to visit the outstanding collections of the Natural History Museum of Paris while I was an undergraduate. Most of the projects I was participating in had a strong taxonomic focus, and therefore specimens were the basis of my research. I had become specialized in measuring snout-vent length, counting scales, and describing the coloration of preserved lizards, frogs, and snakes from across the world. With these, I started to better understand the importance of historical labels, catalog numbers, old publications citing these specimens, and modern databases. My path turned to Africa during master’s thesis work as I started working with the poorly known fauna of two Portuguese-speaking countries on the continent: Angola, in southwestern Africa, and São Tomé & Príncipe, an island nation in the Gulf of Guinea. For this work, I learned another new skill: specimen collecting. As an apprentice naturalist, I learned where to find species of interest, how to collect them safely, and how to prepare and fix them to become museum specimens. These new experiences gave me an increased appreciation of our collections and their importance. As an MSc and PhD student, I described species new to science, and catalogued and mapped herp diversity to support their conservation. Although I’ve visited many collections in Europe, Africa, and the US (including CMNH!), I was mostly based in Portugal. The Portuguese collections had suffered considerable neglect which made most of them almost unusable. However, taxonomists need collections, so together with colleagues, I embarked on the mission of rescuing those collections to make them accessible and usable for researchers. Through this process I learned how a collection should be housed, and best practices for collection management and care. I became a collections manager! Currently, while I still love to do research, participate in fieldwork, and describe new species, I love to be taking care of specimens in old jars, making them accessible to researchers and to the public, telling stories about them, and ensuring they are preserved for generations to come. Natural history collections, such as the one we have at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, are fundamental tools for science and conservation, and new promising technologies are showing us that their potential is far beyond my traditional snout-vent length measuring and scale counting. Becoming the Collection Manager of the Section of Amphibians and Reptiles of Carnegie Museum of Natural History is both a challenge and an honor. And what I find more curious about it, is that in 2018, when I visited the museum and used its collections for my own research, I remember saying to myself: this is a city where I could see myself living! Mariana Marques is Collection Manager of Amphibians and Reptiles at Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Celebrating Women in the Natural History Art Collection by Olivia Buehler Within the collections of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, one may be surprised to find more than the biological specimens, fossils, and extensive anthropological and archaeological materials that the museum is best known for. As a major scientific institution that collects and conducts research, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History also has its own “Natural History Art” Collection, formerly known as the M. Graham Netting Animal Portraiture Collection, named after the herpetologist, former CMNH director, and founder of the collection. Consisting mostly of mid-twentieth-century naturalist and scientific illustrations, this collection serves as a useful addition to the museum’s resources that complements its research activities. Naturalist and scientific illustration involves skills beyond image-making and can resemble scientific research in that it requires artists to closely observe, and often travel to, their subjects to fully understand them and render them accurately. Within the collection are several women artists and scientific illustrators who each contributed to the genres of naturalist and scientific illustration. In this post I will feature the artists Winifred Austen, Germaine A. Bernier-Boulanger, Florence Malewotkuk, and an artist only identified (for now) as “Deirdre E. L.,” who are all worth celebrating this Women’s History Month. Although greatly outnumbered in the collection by their male counterparts, the women in CMNH’s Natural History Art Collection, and their respective works, speak volumes. With some pieces dating to over one hundred years ago, these artworks are proof that women have always had important roles to play in art and science, and it is just the conditions of patriarchal societies that have limited them. Despite their existence as a minority in the field of naturalist and scientific illustration, and the associated income and opportunity disparities that came with that status, these women persevered to create the beautiful, informative, and humorous art below. Winifred Austen One such artist is Winifred Austen, an English painter, etcher, and engraver whose work became most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with her wildlife illustrations in books and magazines. Produced as an illustration for F.B. Kirkman’sBritish Bird Book,Austen’sGolden Orioles(1909) is a lovely example of her expertise in wildlife painting, specifically birds. While the orioles are painted with a thoughtful hand in precise, impressive detail, their surrounding environment is rendered in a far more impressionistic style, emphasizing Austen’s utilization of her formal training in the arts, but also her choice to employ individualistic, stylistic expression and creativity. Even though these watercolors were intended to act as visual references for the texts they were accompanying, Austen still managed to contribute in a manner that was unique to her. Austen’s art can be praised for the dynamism of her subjects, and her portrayal of birds as they would appear in their natural environments, rather than in the static and perfectly poised way some other naturalist illustrators tend to favor. Austen attended and trained formally at the London County Council School of Arts and Crafts and exhibited her work often with the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, following a similar trajectory as many of her male contemporaries. With that being said, Austen also made incredible progress despite being a minority in her practice, for example, she was the only woman to be published in theBritish Bird Book. Germaine A. Bernier-Boulanger A prime example of a woman who knew her worth as a scientist, educator, and artist, and settled for nothing less, is Germaine A. Bernier-Boulanger (1909-1989).Salvelinus fontinalis, female(c. 1953), a highly detailed, scientific illustration of a female spotted trout, is one of three prints in the collection by Bernier-Boulanger. Unlike the more painterly quality of Austen’s watercolors, Bernier-Boulanger’s work highlights the more research-intensive, “art for science’s sake” approach to wildlife illustration that contributed greatly to the discipline of non-photographic specimen documentation. Bernier-Boulanger had formally studied embryology and invertebrate zoology and didn’t become a professional illustrator until after the age of forty. Before focusing on her art, Bernier-Boulanger was employed at the Montreal Botanical Institute, and later, the University of Montreal, where she left her post as an educator after experiencing no change in her career trajectory, despite voicing her disapproval of the discrepancies in pay and career advancement between herself and her male colleagues in the natural sciences department. During Women’s History Month, it is especially important to tell the stories of women like Bernier-Boulanger, not only because of their knowledge, skill, and contributions to their respective fields, but also because they challenged long-standing discriminatory practices against women within the institutions they worked for, acting as catalysts for change. Florence Malewotkuk Florence Malewotkuk (1906-1971) (Yup’ik) was born in a village on St. Lawrence Island on the Bering Sea, which is part of Alaska. Malewotkuk’sHusky Dog Team(circa 1950s-60s) is one of three prints by the artist in the collection by Malewotkuk, each part of a series she titled “Bering Sea Originals.” Depicting husky dogs lined up in front of drying pelts, this print, along with the others in the collection depicting walrus and polar bears, offers unembellished images of local wildlife, and the intersection with nonhuman animals and Yup’ik communities. Showing talent from an early age, Malewotkuk began working as a professional artist in her early twenties when commissioned by Otto William Geist, an archaeologist, to capture everyday scenes of Yup’ik life. Further commissions followed for Malewotkuk later in life, and today her art is housed in collections across North America. Malewotkuk’s story indicates the opportunities that art production offers to women, and the importance of having members of Indigenous groups, especially women, depict their culture from their point of view. Deirdre E. L. Tucked away in a drawer of archival ephemera in the Natural History Art Collection is a folder of comedic cartoon illustrations by the artist Deirdre E. L. With the signature “Deirdre” at the bottom of the sketches being the only source of information available on the artist, it would seem that we must let her work speak where a biography is absent. Perhaps designed for the amusement of CMNH staff or for print in museum publications, Deirdre’s sketches combine silly captions and quirky caricatures with relevant information about the museum. Her sketch of CMNH chief staff artist Ottmar Von Fuehrer jokes about his going “directly to nature” (by sticking his head in a lion’s mouth) for inspiration, and is a fine example of this fun dichotomy. Her heart-warming sketch of a couple embracing under an equally affectionate pair of dinosaur fossils captures her sketchy, endearing drawing style. In this brief survey, I hope to have captured a glimpse of the talented women artists and scientific illustrators in CMNH’s Natural History Art collection. As a History of Art and Architecture and Museum Studies student at Pitt, I have been very interested in exploring the many intersections that exist between the disciplines of art and natural histories, including questions like: What distinguishes a scientific illustrator from an artist, if there is any distinction at all? How do women fit into and contribute to these respective disciplines historically? And how do studies of gender reveal vital information about science and art history? I look forward to discovering new artists as I continue to work with the Natural History Art Collection as an intern, especially women whose presence in the collection inspire me to learn more about those who challenged, and continue to challenge, societal expectations and make lasting contributions to the worlds of art and science. Olivia Buehler is an intern in the Section of Anthropology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

You may have read about stopping the practice of raking your leaves in the fall because of the important nutrients and habitat for beloved wildlife the fallen material provides in your own backyard. The same goes for ourforests, an environment where scientists have studied this critical component for many decades. The leaf litter in forests acts as a protective layer for soil conditions. It creates a physical barrier between the soil surface and atmosphere that reduces soil drying, responds to atmospheric temperature fluctuations, and reduces erosion from precipitation events. Through decomposition, nutrients stored in the dead material re-enter the system and act as a natural fertilizer for plants throughout the year. The controls and nutrient cycling are especially important for forest wildflowers. Many forest wildflowers begin their aboveground life cycles in early spring before the trees have developed their leaves. During this time, light at the forest floor is highest, allowing wildflowers to gain high amounts of energy. However, before they emerge from below ground storage organs or germinate from seeds, the flowers are thought to rely on environmental cues to know when to begin this growth without the risk of frost damage. These environmental cues include soil temperature, which is regulated by the leaf litter layer. Despite many decades of research on the leaf litter component of forests, little is known about the influence of it on the timing of these lifecycle events (or phenology) for wildflowers. Past and ongoing research in the CMNH Section of Botany explores the changing phenology of many plants. One ongoing project is looking at the impact of early tree leaf out and the extended phenology of non-native shrubs on forest wildflower phenology and biological success. The question of the leaf litter’s role in wildflower phenology arose after some simple, but fascinating, natural history observations early last spring—noted variations in phenology within our research site. We struggled to find some tagged individual plants, despite many of the same species being not only present in surrounding areas, but in full bloom. After moving the layer of leaf litter, we found the “missing” plants nearly a week behind in growth compared to their neighbors. These observations were more common than initially thought, and strongly related to the decomposition rate of each leaf litter species. Tree species that produced slower-decaying leaf litter delayed the phenology of plants more than those that produced faster decomposing litter. This underexplored relationship inspired one of the research projects I’m working on this year. My project is aimed at understanding how different amounts of leaf litter control the cues for wildflower phenology. Specifically, I want to know how leaf litter regulates the soil temperature and moisture within relatively small areas of our site and how the wildflowers respond. To test this, I have several leaf litter manipulation plots where I removed all leaf litter in some subplots and added it to another of the same size. To measure the changes related to leaf litter, I record soil temperature and moisture and wildflower phenology. I began collecting this data in early March and have already noticed many differences. Before many of the flowers have started their aboveground lifecycles, they were already present in plots without leaf litter, but still hiding under the leaves in both the litter addition and the control plots. On a few of our random freezing days, the top layer of soil and plants were frozen in litter removal plots, while the same layer of soil was moist and visibly warmer in the litter addition plots. Additionally, one wildflower, trout lily, frequently grew around stray Sycamore leaves, which happen to be one of the slower decomposing species. The findings from this project will not only allow us to gain a better understanding of relationships among species but will also provide a basis for understanding variations in phenology within a site. Stay tuned for final results from this project! Abby Yancy is a researcher in the Section of Botany. Museum employees blog about their unique experiences and knowledge gained from working at the museum. Related Content Beech Drops Collected On This Day in 1982: One Specimen Isn’t Always Enough!

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Museum History  Carnegie Museum of Natural History is one of the great cultural institutions funded and built by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who made his fortune in Pittsburgh’s steel industry. Carnegie’s vision was that the museum would exhibit the wonders of nature to everyone from mill workers to affluent society members. When it opened in 1895, the museum’s early collections included artifacts from ancient Egypt, beautiful minerals, exotic wildlife taxidermy, and, of course, dinosaurs. Carnegie, an ardent evolutionist, had a particular interest in dinosaurs that fueled paleontology expeditions. In the late 1890s, expeditions to the western United States led to the discovery ofDiplodocus carnegiiand many other dinosaurs. Early expeditions yielded more than 400 crates of fossils that kick-started the dinosaur collection that filled the now-famousDinosaurs in Their Timehall. As the museum grew and expanded, Carnegie botanists, entomologists, zoologists, anthropologists, and other scientists studying the natural world traveled abroad on expeditions from the Arctic to the Amazon in search of new discoveries and scientific insights. The artifacts, flora, and fauna they collected grew the Carnegie research and display collection from thousands to millions of objects. Continuing this spirit of exploration, but now a little closer to home, the museum establishedPowdermill NatureReservein 1956. The new field station and laboratory in Rector, Pennsylvania helped museum researchers do long-term studies of natural populations in western Pennsylvania. More than 100 years after Carnegie’s initial gift, Carnegie Museum of Natural History remains a place of scientific inquiry and a world class public institution. As species die out and habitats decline, a new emphasis has been placed on conservation. By displaying nature’s wonders, museum leaders hope to spark conversation about the inherent worth of nature and to inspire a new generation of scientists to conserve both the planet and Carnegie’s vision. sidebar About Get Involved Bring a Group Powdermill More Information"

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Michael J. Bainbridge Wins the 2024 Carnegie Mineralogical Award byTravis Olds, Assistant Curator of Minerals March 4, 2025 I am pleased to announce Michael J. Bainbridge as the winner of the 2024 Carnegie Mineralogical Award. Established in 1987 through the generosity of The Hillman Foundation Inc., the award honors outstanding contributions in mineralogical preservation, conservation, and education. Michael is the Assistant Curator of Mineralogy at theCanadian Museum of Naturein Ottawa. Over the course of his career, he has elevated the field of mineral photography, published in leading mineralogical publications, and contributed to groundbreaking works such asMinerals of the Grenville Province: New York, Ontario, and Québec. Michael has blended art and science to preserve and showcase the beauty of minerals, inspiring collectors and researchers alike. He has immortalized some of the rarest and best-of-species minerals, and this award recognizes the many wonderful contributions he has made to mineral heritage through his lens. Among his achievements, Bainbridge’s mineral photography has been featured in important works, such asThe Pinch Collectionat the Canadian Museum of Nature, and numerous articles inRocks and MineralsandThe Mineralogical Record. His work has ensured that specimens of scientific and cultural significance are preserved and appreciated by future generations. As a co-author ofMinerals of the Grenville Province, Bainbridge helped document the mineralogical heritage of one of North America’s most storied geological regions. His contributions toMindat.organd numerous mineral symposia have further enriched the global mineralogical community. “I love to teach, and I love to tell stories, but I think both are fueled by a desire to learn for myself,” said Michael, reflecting on his achievements. “I’ve always been technically minded but artistically inclined, so combining my passion for minerals with my love of photography has proven the perfect vehicle for me to pursue and share both the scientific and the aesthetic. It has afforded me access to some of the world’s great collections and sparked collaborations with some of the community’s most influential amateurs and professionals alike. “Among my proudest accomplishments,thePinchbookstands in high relief. Pushing the boundaries of photomicroscopy in documenting some of the smallest and rarest specimens of Mont Saint-Hilaire has been both challenging and rewarding. Ensuring top-notch reproductions for Lithographie’s publications has proven a similarly worthy endeavor. The significant finds I have made as a field collector are also close to my heart. But seeing new people come to the hobby through doors I have helped to open—whether through the Recreational Geology Project or co-founding the newOttawa Valley Mineral Club—has perhaps been the most rewarding of all. “More than anything, I am grateful for the many opportunities to share what I have learned along the way. And now, I look forward to the next chapter in my career as I assist in curating Canada’s national collection at the Canadian Museum of Nature. I am truly honored and humbled by this recognition of my small part in helping to present and preserve the world’s mineralogical heritage for future generations.” I had the honor of presenting the award to Michael at the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show on February 15, 2025. Congratulations, Michael! 2025 Carnegie Mineralogical Award Nominations are now being accepted for the 2025 Carnegie Mineralogical Award, and the deadline is November 15, 2025. Eligible candidates include educators, private mineral enthusiasts and collectors, curators, museums, mineral clubs and societies, mineral symposiums, universities, and publications.

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Research at Powdermill  Powdermill Nature Reserve, the environmental research center of Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Rector, Pennsylvania, has been dedicated to its mission of research, education, and conservation for more than 60 years. It is a place for scientists, students, and families who are interested in the natural world. Researchers on staff and from around the world conduct diverse long- and short-term scientific studies in forest ecology, herpetology, botany, invertebrate zoology, and ornithology. The research programs at Powdermill take advantage of the Reserve’s unique combination of the wide variety of habitats found in the Allegheny Mountains. Powdermill is a member of the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the Association of Nature Center Administrators (ANCA). Research Inquiries Powdermill has research staff conducting studies in avian ecology, forest succession, stream ecology, and more. A detailed vegetation survey of the entire property is available to visiting researchers as baseline data, and there is a weather station that records most standard parameters continuously. Powdermill is part of Carnegie Museum of Natural History and thus can draw on considerable expertise from the museum staff. Roughly 30 research associates from across the United States and internationally conduct studies on a wide range of topics. Powdermill actively seeks new research partners and graduate students to undertake field studies on the property utilizing our new facilities. Inquire about becoming a research partner. Research Facilities The Reserve offers a LEED Gold certified headquarters building with two furnished classrooms; user-friendly audio-visual equipment; a spacious deck overlooking the Powdermill woods; two exhibition galleries focusing on our avian research and stream ecology; a modern conference room; outdoor teaching area; and catering kitchen. These areas are ideal for meetings, workshops, and conferences at a reasonable rental charge. An innovative Marsh Machine wastewater treatment system ties in with the Living Stream aquarium demonstrating that the organisms that live in our exceptional value stream can also live in the system-treated water. Several well-equipped cabins are available at a nominal charge to visiting researchers, university groups, or participants in conferences in the headquarters building. We have a modern GIS lab that can provide support to visiting researchers. The Powdermill Avian Research Center maintains a permanent bird banding program with a massive database available for baseline data and a bioacoustics lab specializing in the study of nocturnal flight songs. There is some desk space available to long-term researchers. Limited high-speed Internet access is available. Starting Research at Powdermill Powdermill offers the advantage of long-term stability for multi-year projects and the ability to undertake controlled manipulations. Populations of plants or animals can be permanently marked and accessed as needed with little concern for external disturbance. Most of the property is closed to the public and reserved for research only by select, professional researchers. A detailed vegetation map of the entire 2,200-acre property is available to collaborators and visiting researchers. Habitats The reserve has typical vegetation of the mid-Appalachian region, roughly 400-640 m above sea level. Most was logged in the late 1880s to early 1920s and has been uncut since then. The forest is dominated by oaks and maples, with substantial populations of beech, hickory, tulip tree, and some hemlock. The known flora of the reserve comprises more than 850 species in 129 families. There are also roughly 200 acres of old field habitats with diverse and representative vegetation. Habitats present a mosaic of subtle differences due to variations in land use in the first half of the 1900s. The property has several forested streams with healthy aquatic ecosystems and in other areas impacted by old coal mines. The bird banding station includes several small ponds and areas of dense, shrubby secondary growth. Part of the property borders the Forbes State Forest and there are other researcher-accessible properties nearby. Powdermill offers a large area of healthy and representative forest and old field habitats. These habitats contain diverse fauna and many opportunities for research and long-term studies. Our location is convenient to large urban areas of the middle Atlantic region and dozens of universities are within several hours drive. Costs of working at Powdermill are nominal and opportunities are numerous. sidebar About Get Involved Bring a Group Powdermill More Information"

        "content": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History One of the Four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh From Collections User To Collections Manager Introducing Mariana Marques, the New Collection Manager for the Section of Amphibians and Reptiles by Mariana Marques I’m not sure when I first entered in a natural history museum, but I know that these establishments have always been my favorite places to visit. I did my bachelor’s degree in biology in the University of Évora, a small and picturesque town in southern Portugal surrounded by one of the most biodiverse habitats of the Iberian Peninsula, the unique savanna-like ecosystem known as the “montado.” In the intervals between classes, I loved to go look for the critters that surrounded the university field station where most of my classes were held. I was lucky enough to be in one of the places with the highest diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the country, and in a natural and unspoiled area which meant that I could easily see good numbers of these animals. Being able to handle and study these animals in the field woke up my passion for herpetology, and I decided that I wanted to become a herpetologist. I started to collaborate on projects in herpetology, and I was lucky enough to visit the outstanding collections of the Natural History Museum of Paris while I was an undergraduate. Most of the projects I was participating in had a strong taxonomic focus, and therefore specimens were the basis of my research. I had become specialized in measuring snout-vent length, counting scales, and describing the coloration of preserved lizards, frogs, and snakes from across the world. With these, I started to better understand the importance of historical labels, catalog numbers, old publications citing these specimens, and modern databases. My path turned to Africa during master’s thesis work as I started working with the poorly known fauna of two Portuguese-speaking countries on the continent: Angola, in southwestern Africa, and São Tomé & Príncipe, an island nation in the Gulf of Guinea. For this work, I learned another new skill: specimen collecting. As an apprentice naturalist, I learned where to find species of interest, how to collect them safely, and how to prepare and fix them to become museum specimens. These new experiences gave me an increased appreciation of our collections and their importance. As an MSc and PhD student, I described species new to science, and catalogued and mapped herp diversity to support their conservation. Although I’ve visited many collections in Europe, Africa, and the US (including CMNH!), I was mostly based in Portugal. The Portuguese collections had suffered considerable neglect which made most of them almost unusable. However, taxonomists need collections, so together with colleagues, I embarked on the mission of rescuing those collections to make them accessible and usable for researchers. Through this process I learned how a collection should be housed, and best practices for collection management and care. I became a collections manager! Currently, while I still love to do research, participate in fieldwork, and describe new species, I love to be taking care of specimens in old jars, making them accessible to researchers and to the public, telling stories about them, and ensuring they are preserved for generations to come. Natural history collections, such as the one we have at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, are fundamental tools for science and conservation, and new promising technologies are showing us that their potential is far beyond my traditional snout-vent length measuring and scale counting. Becoming the Collection Manager of the Section of Amphibians and Reptiles of Carnegie Museum of Natural History is both a challenge and an honor. And what I find more curious about it, is that in 2018, when I visited the museum and used its collections for my own research, I remember saying to myself: this is a city where I could see myself living! Mariana Marques is Collection Manager of Amphibians and Reptiles at Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

CRSP operates at the intersection of three ideas: 1) museum resources are valuable for understanding environmental change, 2) museums are underserving rural audiences, and 3) complex socio-scientific environmental change topics are deeply connected to social decision-making in rural communities. Over the past four years, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, together with the University of Pittsburgh, has engaged community partners across rural Western Pennsylvania in a research practice partnership that supports professional networking, reflection and learning about human-caused climate change. Through this partnership we seek to improve methodologies and practices for practitioners to effectively address climate change issues with their audiences, including the museum’s work with its audiences. The project is centered at two community hubs: Powdermill Nature Reserve in the Laurel Highlands and Mercer County Conservation District north of Pittsburgh. Community partners across these hubs have included formal and informal educators, conservation practitioners, watershed specialists, land managers, farmers, environmental advocates, recreationists, industry leaders, and scientists. Together, we have explored strategies to overcome social and political barriers to talking about human-caused climate change and encourage conversation about the climate impacts and solutions, both present and future, here in rural Western Pennsylvania. CRSP partners: Mercer County Conservation District, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, University of Pittsburgh Center for Learning in Out-of-School Environments, and Powdermill Nature Reserve & Avian Research Center A cross-disciplinary team leads this learning research project, with scientists and educators at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History providing expertise in ecological and climate science, science communication, and facilitation techniques, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Center for Learning in Out-of-School Environments (UPCLOSE) providing expertise in learning research and practitioners at Powdermill Nature Reserve and the Mercer County Conservation District providing expertise in environmental education, conservation, and engagement with rural communities. Our collective work supports socially safe, science-based discussions about human-caused climate change and is building regional capacity for information exchange across organizations. CRSP Resource Library The resources found in this library were co-produced by CRSP network partners and CMNH scientists and educators to spark climate change conversations with public rural audiences. Co-production is a process through which the creation of new knowledge or resources remains relevant to the needs and experiences of the community members it is meant to support. CRSP network partners were involved in all stages of creation, from defining a shared goal for the resource to developing and refining content. Please use any of the resources you see, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have a question! Climate Conversations Starter Guide  for theLaurel Highlands When it comes to climate conversations, where do you begin? This guide is meant to help you get conversations started with eight different “Have you noticed…?” questions related to local climate change solutions and impacts based on the latest scientific evidence. The booklet also includes some general tips for talking about climate, six climate actions you can take, and a section on climate science basics. Use this guide as an information resource to help you feel more comfortable and confident with climate change topics. You can also pull information from this guide to incorporate into programming, materials, or other engagements. The Road to Farm Resilience to Weather Extremes These tri-fold pamphlets were co-produced by farmers and ag professionals at the Shenango River Valley CRSP hub (Shenango Climate and Rural Environmental Studies Team or S-CREST) and Bonnie McGill, a CRSP scientist and illustrator. During 2021, the group explored local climate data and worked to write the pamphlet text for their intended audience, conventional farmers in the region growing corn and soybeans. The group wanted to make a resource that could help them have conversations with such farmers about how certain conservation practices will help farmers build resilience in their operations to the current and worsening impacts of climate change. Many of these practices also build soil carbon, which mitigates climate change. Signs of Climate Change in Migratory Songbirds of Pennsylvania This infographic looks to migratory songbirds as teachers, showing us how climate change is here and now rather than somewhere else in the future. These birds, and thePowdermill Avian Research Centerscientists who study them, show us how climate change is speeding up their arrival from the south and the timing of their nesting dates – a pace they might not be able to keep up with. You can use this infographic to share the story of migratory songbirds, something everyone in Western Pennsylvania can notice and care about, and start a conversation about what we can do to help them in the face of a changing climate. Research Publications “Shifting Climate Communication Narratives Toward Actions and Futures in a Rural Area of Appalachia“ McGill, B. M., Nelson, T., Steiner, M. A., &Heller, N. E.(2024). Shifting Climate Communication Narratives Toward Actions and Futures in a Rural Area of Appalachia.Science Communication,46(2), 178-209.https://doi.org/10.1177/10755470241227443 This peer-review research publication shares results from CRSP workshops with professional networks in the Laurel Highlands. Workshops were designed to understand rural perspectives and support effective climate talk rooted in evidence from climate change communication science. We analyze the social and economic context of climate conversations in Western Pennsylvania, the content and framings of climate action expressed by rural network members and offer strategies for shifting climate talk from issues and past (e.g. impacts) toward action and futures (e.g. solutions). “Taking time to listen and learn: a museum partnership designed to engage rural audiences in climate change conversations“ MaryAnn Steiner, Karen Knutson, Kevin Crowley, Nicole Heller, Bonnie McGill, Laurie Giarratani, Jay Russell & Taiji Nelson (2023) Taking time to listen and learn: a museum partnership designed to engage rural audiences in climate change conversations, Museums & Social Issues, DOI:10.1080/15596893.2023.2263528 Brook Trout in a Warming World Trout fishing is deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of Pennsylvania’s Laurel Highlands, yet many stewards have been noticing how climate change is jeopardizing its future. This story navigates climate change from the perspective of the Brook Trout, holding a hopeful call to action front and center and highlighting several organizations in the Laurel Highlands working to address climate change, protect Brook Trout, and pass on the legacy of trout fishing to future generations. You can use this storymap to spark climate conversations with various Brook Trout stakeholders, from anglers to students to conservation groups, that inspire stewardship on behalf of both the Brook Trout and ourselves. Striving for a Better Future on the Shenango This storymap centers on the Shenango River, a beloved waterway for those who live, work, and play around it, to explain the relationship between climate change, the water cycle, and the watershed-level impacts that threaten nearby communities. The story also highlights different organizations and projects in Northwestern Pennsylvania working to address climate change in the Shenango River Watershed. You can use this storymap We Are NaturePodcast This podcast series features stories of natural histories and livable futures directly from individuals and organizations on the frontlines of climate change adaptation and mitigation, conservation, and building just and joyous futures for all life. Use these podcast stories to learn and teach about locally relevant issues and actions, and to inspire hope in others.
