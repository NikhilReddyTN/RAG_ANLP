How a Submarine Dives Submarines have ballast tanks between their inner and outer hulls. When the submarine is on the surface, the ballast tanks are filled with air and the submarine floats.To dive, vents are opened on the bottom of the submarine to allow seawater into the ballast tanks. As the water rushes in, the air is forced out through vents in the upper hull. The change in weight causes the submarine to submerge.To surface, air is pumped back into the ballast tanks, which forces the seawater out through the bottom vents. The submarine rises as it becomes lighter. Movable fins on the submarine sides in the front and back allow the crew to control the depth and stability of the submarine.

This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to information collected by Carnegie Museums through the Sites, through any other online location where this Policy is published, and through our other interactions with you, including but not limited to, via mail, telephone, email, online transactions, online programming and onsite visits at our museums or to Carnegie Museums programs, exhibits or events at other locations (collectively with the Sites, the “Services”). This Policy only applies to information that you provide or we collect from you through the Services identified above. Other web sites, mobile applications, and online services, including any third-party services you use to interact with Carnegie Museums, may have their own privacy policies and you should consult those policies accordingly. Policy Changes Carnegie Museums reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. Since this Policy may change as we modify or expand our Services, we suggest you check back from time to time in order to understand how we currently handle your information. Our Policy’s effective date will always be set forth at the beginning and end of the Policy. Any changes will be immediately incorporated into this Policy. Any change to this Policy is effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any changes are made to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If any changes are unacceptable to you, you are no longer authorized to use the Services and should cease all such use. The Information We Collect Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is generally defined as information that, by itself or in combination with other information, is reasonably capable of being linked to a specific individual. Depending on how you interact with Carnegie Museums, there are certain aspects of the Services where we will only collect Personal Information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide, and other aspects of the Services provided through the Sites where we may automatically collect data from you, including your Internet Protocol address (IP address), cookies, and other online identifiers that may include portions of Personal Information through the use of tracking technology (see the “Information Collected Automatically” section, below). For example, Personal Information you voluntarily provide to the Carnegie Museums may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, username and password, age/birthdate, credit/debit card number or other payment information, photograph, image, voice, likeness or other identifiable characteristics, office address and other business or organizational information, or any other type of data that, directly or indirectly, is reasonably capable of being associated with someone. You may be asked to provide such Personal Information to Carnegie Museums when you: Carnegie Museums generally will not ask you to provide any sensitive data, such as your religious beliefs, citizenship status, sexual orientation, or your race or ethnicity, but you may be able to voluntarily provide such sensitive data in content that you upload, post or otherwise provide on or through the Services. To the extent you voluntarily make any sensitive data available through the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such data may be processed by Carnegie Museums as necessary to provide the Services in accordance with your instructions. Information Collected Automatically There are areas of the Sites where Carnegie Museums or our service providers may automatically collect certain data as you use the Sites and navigate elsewhere online, such as your IP address and other data about your Internet connection, your operating system, browser type, and other services or equipment you use to access the Sites, and usage data about your interaction with our Sites. This automatically collected data generally does not identify any specific individual, but to the extent such data is reasonably capable of identifying you or another person, we will treat such data as Personal Information. This automatically collected information may include data on how you use our Sites, what pages you have visited, or any errors that occurred while you were visiting our Sites. This information may be used by Carnegie Museums to help us in developing content and improving our Sites to create the best experience for our visitors. The technology used to automatically collect this information may utilize cookies, which are small files sent to your browser by our Sites when you visit. Cookies can be used to track usage patterns, trends and visitor behavior, as well as to record other information regarding your visit. These cookies may allow us to share information with our trusted advertising partners which enables us to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms based on your previous interactions with our Sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change the preference on your browser to reject them. Doing so however, may affect your ability to use certain features of our Sites. We may also use third-party analytics providers which could automatically collect certain Personal Information and other data about you through the Sites including, but not limited to, your IP address and/or other online identifiers. Third-party cookies or other tracking technology may be used through this process to track data such as the times you most frequently use the Sites, what devices you use to access the Services, what parts of the Services you visit and the links you use to get there. These data and analytics service providers may use such information to track how you use the Services, measure the performance of the Services, improve features on the Services, and provide Carnegie Museums with tools that satisfy overall operating needs for the Services. Carnegie Museums may then use feedback from these service providers to improve the Services and our interactions with you. All of the above-referenced IP addresses and other data will be collected in an automated manner and we may maintain that information or associate it with certain other data, which may include Personal Information you provide voluntarily through the Services. This helps us improve our Services, deliver better and more personalized Services, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and store information about your preferences. How We Use Your Information Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to appropriately respond to your requests and to provide a variety of Services. Personal Information regarding your interests will allow us to provide materials to meet your specific needs. Museum personnel may, for example, use the Personal Information to customize offers, target communications through mail and email, and to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms.  More specifically, Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to: Carnegie Museums or its designees may, from time to time, compile statistics on visitors to our museums and Sites and/or work with others compiling statistics or performing other quantitative analysis. In these situations, data that Carnegie Museums has related to your interactions with the Services may be used to aggregate statistical information to analyze visitor interest or other aspects of non-profit organization-related activities. The information aggregated will not include any Personal Information as it relates to a single visitor. Sharing Information Carnegie Museums may share certain portions of Personal Information with vendors that help provide certain Services on behalf of Carnegie Museums in order to make the Services function properly. This may include sharing certain kinds of Personal Information, including without limitation, your credit card, debit card or other payment information, and/or your voice, likeness and any other Personal Information you make available in connection with Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other Services with: Under certain circumstances, we may trade or exchange contact information such as your mailing and email addresses among other Personal Information you provide during registration processes online, over the phone, or in-person at our museum locations, with reputable third-party museums and other cultural organizations that are not related to Carnegie Museums. If you do not want your information to be provided to such third-party organizations in connection with this activity, please contact us atmembership@carnegiemuseums.orgor call us at 412.622.3314. You also can review the “Your Choices” section, below, for other details on how you may be able to request changes regarding Carnegie Museums’ handling of Personal Information it maintains about you. As stated above, Carnegie Museums may use video conference service providers when providing virtual learning programs or other online events. When registering for such online Services, please review any information made available about the video conference service provider for the applicable program or event, including that provider’s privacy policy, for more details about how that provider may handle the Personal Information or other data it collects from you. Other third parties, such as social media platforms and other providers of services that rely on user generated content may be able to collect certain data that could include your Personal Information over time and across different online services when you interact with the Sites and other online Services. If at any time it becomes reasonably necessary, we will release the Personal Information and other data Carnegie Museums maintains about you if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or in cooperation with a government or law enforcement investigation, to comply with a court order, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Carnegie Museums, its personnel, the users of its Services, or others. Personal Information received or held by Carnegie Museums may be transferred if our ownership status changes. Under such circumstances, Carnegie Museums will make reasonable efforts to cause any successor to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. We also may disclose your Personal Information to other service providers to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts related to your use of the Services, or as otherwise described to you at or before the point when we collect your Personal Information. As a donor, member, and visitor of the Carnegie Museums, as a user of the Sites or our other Services, and by providing to or otherwise allowing Carnegie Museums to collect the Personal Information and other data referenced above, you agree, without limitation or qualification, that Carnegie Museums may process such Personal Information and other data in accordance with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Again, please check back periodically for changes to this Policy. Your Choices Depending on where you are and how you use our Services such as, for example, if you participate in our membership program, you may be able to ask questions or make certain choices with respect to Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you. For example, in some situations you may be able to request (subject to applicable legal exceptions): In addition, depending on where you are when you use our Services, you may submit requests regarding Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you, such as requests to: If at any time you would like to request the ability to edit or delete any Personal Information Carnegie Museums may have about you, opt-out of receiving further information from Carnegie Museums, limit what we share, or if you otherwise wish to ask Carnegie Museums to cease using your Personal Information in the manners specified in this Policy (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), please call the Membership Office at 412.622.3314 or send us an email using the addressmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Carnegie Museums is required to try to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information. If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, Carnegie Museums will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Information we store about you before responding to your request. If more information is needed to verify your identity in certain situations, Carnegie Museums may deny your request or ask for more details as necessary to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure and deletion. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, nor does it guarantee that we will be able to process your request. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. The Carnegie Museums reserve the right to refuse any request made regarding your Personal Information if we are unable to process the request for any reason, such as if we are unable to verify the identity of the person making the request or if we cannot authenticate the legitimacy of the request using reasonable efforts. Carnegie Museums is under no obligation or duty to verify the legitimacy of any request regarding Personal Information. Any removal of content by Carnegie Museums does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. Carnegie Museums will do our best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Information from the specified uses. Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request. If the request relates to information Carnegie Museums needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward. Carnegie Museums reserve the right to maintain proper records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from the Carnegie Museums, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send us a detailed email atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell web sites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. The Sites are not currently configured to respond to “do not track” or similar automated privacy controls. To learn more about ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that occur when you browse the Internet generally and may lead to targeted advertising, visit theNetwork Advertising Initiative web siteand theDigital Advertising Alliance web site. Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that certain third parties may receive information through the Services. Since some of these third parties may respond differently than Carnegie Museums to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information. Information Security To protect your Personal Information, Carnegie Museums uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information and other data stored on or through our Services. Personal Information provided to or collected by Carnegie Museums is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information and other data that could include your Personal Information by placing it on a secure portion of our Sites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of Carnegie Museums. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information. The transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Carnegie Museums, for example. Therefore, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Sites. If you are concerned about sending information to Carnegie Museums online, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. Carnegie Museums is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online. Carnegie Museums retains collected information for as long as needed to fulfill the stated purpose for which the Personal Information was collected or otherwise processed, and thereafter for a variety of legitimate purposes in support of Carnegie Museums and our Services. Carnegie Museums also will retain collected information connected to organizational records for periods of time required or permitted by law. These may include retention periods that are: (1) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations that apply to Carnegie Museums’ operations; (2) for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or (3) needed to maintain adequate and accurate organizational records.  If Carnegie Museums determines that information is no longer needed and no legal obligation to retain such data exists, it will delete such information. Our record-keeping times will be consistent with applicable law. If you have any questions about the security or retention of your Personal Information, please contact us. Children’s Information Carnegie Museums may collect certain Personal Information from teenagers who are between 13-18 years old and qualify to receive free access to the Carnegie Museums and our Services through our Teen Membership program. We will use this Personal Information to introduce teens who enroll in the program to our museum locations and Services, to organize events and tours related to the Teen Membership program, to provide transportation to such events and tours, and to partner with community-based organizations that serve teens. The Sites are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, individuals under 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 is authorized to use the Sites, and minors younger than 13 are not permitted to provide any information on or through the Sites without the verified consent of any such minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

Carnegie Museums does not and will not knowingly collect or request any information, including Personal Information, from any person under 18 years of age without the consent of the minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If Carnegie Museums learns that we have received Personal Information from any person under 18 years of age without the appropriate consent of the minor’s parent(s) or guardian(s), Carnegie Museums will delete that information. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18, and would like to enroll your child in Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other online Services, believe your child may have used or uploaded or posted information through the Sites inadvertently or without authorization, and such information is publicly available, or if you believe Carnegie Museums might otherwise have information from or about any person under 13 years of age, please contact us immediately atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. International Use and Transfers If you are outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with any local laws regarding your use of the Services, and any related data collection. You also agree and acknowledge that by providing any data through the Services, including Personal Information, that such information may be transmitted to, and stored in, the United States. If you are in the European Economic Area (the “EEA,” which includes the 27 European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (collectively, the “EU”) when you use our Services,  or if you use our Services from other regions with laws governing the collection, use and transfer of Personal Information across international borders, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and processing globally. By providing your information, you hereby agree to permit any transfer and processing by Carnegie Museums in accordance with this Policy.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), individuals in the EU also may have the right to lodge a complaint about Carnegie Museums’ processing of your Personal Information with a supervisory authority. In particular, such individuals may lodge a complaint in the EU Member State where they live or work or where the alleged violation took place. Your Personal Information may be disclosed to and processed by staff operating in the United States. Disclosure will be to individuals who work for Carnegie Museums and organizations with which we have contracted to process or store this data on Carnegie Museums’ behalf. The entities that receive Personal Information as a result of international transfers are required to follow our instructions with respect to the use of Personal Information and comply with appropriate security measures to protect your information. External Links The Services may contain links to external web sites or other online services, including those embedded in third-party advertisements or sponsor information, which are not controlled by Carnegie Museums. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and data collection policies for such third-party services. You should consult the privacy policies of those third-party services for details. Carnegie Museums may also allow interaction between our Services and other third-party services online, including social media providers. This interaction may include plugins that allow you to share information with persons outside of the Services. Please consult the privacy policies of such third-party providers before using them to make sure you are comfortable with the level of sharing.

Delve into the sights and sounds of Mars beneath a beautiful Martian sky and discover how much can be learned by looking with a whole new perspective. A large-scale projection immerses guests in historic visions of Mars. As the story progresses through time, scenes grow increasingly realistic to illustrate how our understanding of Mars has solidified over time. Climatology Generously Supported by The Bozzone Family Foundation Uncover how climates produce the conditions for life to arise or die out through a fun, large-scale digital gallery exclusive to the Science Center. Explore a variety of hypothetical scenarios that would impact the climate systems of either Earth or Mars on 30 ft. x 16 ft. screens using custom digital control stations. Create and test hypotheses, make connections between the two planets, and consider the planets’ abilities to sustain life under vastly different conditions. Climatology is home to a Mars rock, a rare Martian meteorite that likely made its way to Earth as impact ejecta. Compare this Martian rock to rocks we find on Earth. Martian Garden Generously Supported by Henry L. Hillman Foundation See green on the Red Planet! Sustainability and the management of resources is vital to survival on Mars as humans will not be the only life on the planet. Investigate ways to nourish both body and mind. Reimagine ways to grow food and translate a selection of popular Earth dishes to recipes that can be prepared and enjoyed by the inhabitants in a Martian settlement. Live plant pods will tie together potential methods of growing food on Mars and how we might use these same methods to feed ourselves – ethically and sustainably – on Earth. A total of three Pods will introduce visitors to Soilless Growing, Soil Growing, and Biotechnology on Mars. Martian Living Generously Supported by The Philip Chosky Charitable and Educational Foundation Imagine what daily life on Mars might be like by exploring the living space of a future Martian resident. The interactive zone is the first ever to feature tactile displays that highlight how technology built to support life on Mars might already be impacting our lives today. NASA reports that to develop a settlement on Mars, we must first establish a base on the Moon. From Earth to the Moon, to Mars! Learn more on thiswebpage. This area also is home to a moon rock, on loan from NASA. Dream Big: Space Generously Supported by The Rossin Family Foundation Consider and weigh in on decisions facing an imagined Martian settlement and see the impact of your decisions in digital and analog ways. A model of the settlement in the center of the exhibit is built over time to reflect the guests’ collective decisions, allowing you to see their own thoughts literally shape our future on Mars. Your input will be reflected immediately on a digital model and on the physical model over time. Surrounding the model are interactive stations with questions and activities. Pittsburgh in Space Generously Supported by Ray and Joneen Betler Envision the exciting promise of humanity’s future in space, and the cutting-edge research and big picture ideas that will get us there. Learn about the first steps toward humanity inhabiting Mars happen­ing right now in the Pittsburgh region, the impact local space research has already had, and plans for the future. Search for Life Did you know Mars, the Red Planet, once had a climate like Earth’s? That is precisely why we are looking for signs of life there. Control Martian rovers (just like ones on Mars’ surface, today!) to seek out various signs of life and water. Also make connections to how life impacts climate. Moon Rock Touched Down in Martian Living Zone In addition to observing a sliver of Mars, you can now see a Moon Rock on display in Martian Living, generously supported by The Philip Chosky Charitable and Educational Foundation. Carnegie Science Center received Lunar Sample 15499, weighing 74.224 grams on Wed., Dec. 14. It is on loan from NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Crew members of Apollo 15, the fourth human landing on the Moon, collected the sample from the top of a meter-sized boulder at Station 4 on the rim of Dune Crater in 1971. The Moon Rock is vesicular lunar mare basalt with a porphyritic texture. Pittsburgh’s acquisition of the Moon Rock perfectly coincided with the conclusion of NASA’s Artemis I mission to the Moon. NASA’s Orion spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after its 25.5-day mission on Sun., Dec. 11. Experience enhanced exhibition programming With this exhibition, the Science Center leverages assets like the Buhl Planetarium and Rangos Giant Cinema, and its vast array of STEM programming that targets career readiness. Far from a stand-alone experience, the exhibition amplifies the learning happening in camps, classes, assembly programs, workshops, and evolving slate of STEM education and career readiness initiatives. Additionally, we encourage guests to explore Moonshot Museum, one of our neighbors on the North Shore, to dive deeper into space exploration and watch the real-time assembly of a lunar spacecraft. The Science Center connects science and technology to everyday life and meets the challenge of building the STEM identity of students by creating and supporting pathways, programs, and exhibitions. These experiences allow new audiences of young people to see themselves as activists, makers, inventors, healers, and thoughtful connectors in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The new, groundbreaking exhibition Mars: The Next Giant Leap®, with lead support by Howmet Aerospace Foundation and the PNC Foundation, encapsulates these values. General Admission General Admission includes Miniature Railroad & Village®, Mars: The Next Giant Leap®,  Highmark SportsWorks®, four floors of interactive exhibits, live demonstration shows, planetarium astronomy shows, and the USS Requin (SS 481). We ask that all visitors (including Members) to secure your tickets online in advance of arriving. There is no surcharge for online ticket purchases.

        "url": "https://carnegiesciencecenter.org/exhibits/robot-hall-of-fame/",
        "content": "Robot Hall of Fame Powered by Carnegie Mellon The first robots were creations of imagination rather than engineering. The replica robots lining our “walk of fame” are a tribute to the fictional machines that helped spark the imaginations of those who created real robots that followed. Make your way down as you check out seven replicas of some of the most popular robots—and see how they’ve evolved throughout the years. The Iron Giant 1999The Iron Giant is the star of a science fiction, comedy-drama animated film by the same name. In the movie, the alien robot lands near Rockwell, Maine and befriends a local 9-year-old boy, but it faces danger when a paranoid government agent seeks to destroy the robot. Produced by Warner Bros. and released in 1999, the film was critically acclaimed and won nine Annie Awards, but significantly underperformed at the box office. However, because of home video releases and television syndication, it now has a cult following and it is considered a modern animated classic. The robot towers over most others in the Hall of Fame and holds true to its claim as a giant. Maria 1927One of the first robotic icons in science fiction, Maria appears in “Metropolis,” a silent German film directed by Fritz Lang and set in the year 2026 (at the time, 100 years in the future). The robot is never named in the film, but she is an attempt to make an evil mechanical duplicate of the beautiful heroine, Maria. Gort 1951Introduced in the movie classic “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” Gort comes to Earth as the robot bodyguard of the mysterious spaceman, Klaatu. The film was released in the middle of the Cold War, and Gort embodies the threat of the unknown. Robby 1956Robby made his first appearance in the 1956 MGM movie “Forbidden Planet.” Robby is the film’s most memorable character and is responsible for the cult following the movie carries. B-9 1967The robot from TV’s “Lost in Space,” never given a name on the series, was designed by Robert Kinoshita, also the creator of Robby from “Forbidden Planet.” Although endowed with superhuman strength and futuristic weaponry, he often displayed human characteristics such as laughter, sadness, and mockery. HAL 9000 1968HAL is a central character in the film by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, “2001: A Space Odyssey.” As the brain of the spaceship Discovery, HAL is a robot that uses the mechanical, sensing, and information systems under its control and eventually is driven ‘mad’ by the responsibility and secrets he bears. Dewey 1972This is one of the robots from the film “Silent Running.” Many science fiction films in the 1950s had political overtones; “Silent Running” updated the agenda to address the ecological threats that were becoming apparent on Earth. C-3PO 1977This golden robot is half of the most famous robot duo in film history. C-3PO and his side-kick, R2-D2, provided the laughs and propelled the stories of the “Star Wars” films. Tom Servo and Crow 1988-1996Tom Servo and Crow, two of the stars of the cult-favorite, Mystery Science Theater 3000, take up residence as the newest fictional ‘bots in our Robot Hall of Fame. These robots – clearly made from spare parts and old toys – cracked wise on hundreds of cable TV shows for years, mocking the stale story lines, bad acting, and poor production values of some of the worst sci-fi films ever made.

Read about their stories: “The reason I keep attending Tour Your Future programs is because I believe that Tour Your Future programs are priceless opportunities. When I go on a Tour Your Future, I have the ability to meet with, to interact with, to ask questions of, and to learn from women professionals in different fields of STEM.”– 16-year-old Tour Your Future participant “I had a lot of new experiences with the Science Center and STEM. I [had] a fun time seeing new tech and using new tech at the Science Center.” Another student added, “I learned how to be creative by making something new. It (sic) was fun.”– 9th grade student from Perry High School “Last year, I participated in the Pittsburgh Regional Science & Engineering Fair, and I was interviewed for an internship at Magee-Womens Hospital. I was selected for the internship, and while I was there, I participated in a national research study. This study taught me a lot about the research process and about the people involved. I would not have had this opportunity if it wasn’t for the Carnegie Science Center.”– high school PRSEF student Connect with us Subscribe!

Our half-day camps for 4 and 5-year-olds are split into two sessions: 9 a.m.–Noon and 1–4 p.m. to provide the best experience possible for our early learners. Pick up can be a busy time. What can I do to make it easier? Pick-up can be anytime between 3–3:30 p.m. for normal pick up. Our busiest time is at the start of pick-up. Please enter the parking lot and pull a ticket. Drive slowly and staff members will be in the parking lot to help direct you. Be sure to have your photo I.D. ready once inside. Are scholarships available? 2025 Summer Camp Scholarship applications have now closed. All applicants will receive notifications regarding the status of their application by Mon., Feb. 24.

The best part? Everything, whether it’s the model railroad, model village, or the holiday village and holiday railroad, is scaled down – so there’s a really quick commute, even if you’re going from the town square all the way over to the quarry! The Miniature Railroad, which opened in 1954 in Buhl Planetarium, features hundreds of wonderfully realistic animated scenes that illustrate the Pittsburgh region’s rich and diverse history up until 1940. New models are added annually to the village. Newest Additions to The Miniature Railroad & Village®  Chinatown Inn Many folks don’t know Pittsburgh even had a Chinatown! From the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, a vibrant Chinese immigrant community thrived between Second and Third Avenues downtown, featuring markets, grocery stores, and shops. In the 1920s, the construction of the Boulevard of the Allies dissected the community, which led to the neighborhood’s decline. The Chinatown Inn stands as the last surviving business in the neighborhood. It opened in 1943 on the first floor of the On Leong Tong building, which was originally built in 1922. Three generations of the Yee family have operated the restaurant since it opened. Outside of Chinatown Inn is a designated historical marker for Pittsburgh’s Chinatown. The local chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans achieved official Pennsylvania historical landmark status for Downtown’s old Pittsburgh Chinatown in 2021 after 12 years and four separate attempts. The marker represents a beacon of cultural identity and community for Chinese-Americans in Pittsburgh.

Allegheny County Airport  Formerly known as Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Municipal Airport (AGC), Allegheny County Airport opened to a crowd of 100,000 people on Sept. 11, 1931. Architect Stanley L. Rush designed the art deco-style building. When this airport opened, it was the country’s third largest and the region’s main airport until Greater Pittsburgh Airport, which opened in Moon in 1952. Allegheny County Airport is the first visitor’s choice model in Miniature Railroad & Village®. For the first time ever, the Miniature Railroad team opened this 2023 model up for a vote from Sept. 5, 2022 to Jan. 15, 2023. Th Airport won with 22,519 votes. This model combines new and traditional methods. The windows, portico, control tower, doors, and the planters were 3D-printed. In true Bowdish-style, the team hand-painted the floors and the elaborate Aztec detailing around the decorative window above the front doors. Behind Allegheny County Airport is a new animation: an airplane with a spinning propeller. Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh  On June 4, 1890, the old McDevitt mansion in Oakland transformed into the first Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. The idea of a children’s hospital arose from Kirk LeMoyne, son of local pediatrician, Frank LeMoyne. He and his friends decided to raise the necessary $3,000 to endow a single cot at the Western Pennsylvania Hospital. The cot would be used exclusively for babies and children. And in 1887 the Cot Club began its fundraising mission. Eventually, with guidance from his father and their benefactors, Kirk raised enough money for a dedicated children’s hospital. Word spread and donations poured in, along with $40,000 for a new hospital. This modest hospital with 15 beds represented a huge step for medicine and philanthropy in Pittsburgh—all children received treatment regardless of religion, nationality, or class. It has now grown into a world-renowned children’s hospital. Staff 3D-printed the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh model onsite and added intricate details such as flowers on the building, stain glass windows crafted from microfilm, and a windy stone path leading up to the building. Look carefully and you will spot the nurse who prescribed a dose of fresh air for her patients, which is also the first animation added to the Miniature Railroad since 2018. This is the 2023 addition and first-ever hospital model in the Miniature Railroad & Village®. Night of the Living DeadChapel  Built in 1923, the small stone chapel is famous for its appearance in George A. Romero’sNight of the Living Dead (1968). Just like the zombies in the cult classic, the chapel was brought back to life. In 2011, the chapel located in Evans City Cemetery had one foot in the grave and based on its poor condition was slated for demolition. The chapel needed dire assistance. Headed by Gary Streiner, the film’s sound engineer, a grassroots group consisting of the film’s fans raised $47,000 and saved the structure. The model is an iconic structure in Evans City and is nestled in the farmlands section of the Miniature Railroad, surrounded by tombstones as well as other historic Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania landmarks. Gus and Yiayia’s Ice Ball Cart  On the North Side since 1934, Gus and Yiayia’s ice ball cart has served shaved ice treats, popcorn and peanuts to generations of fans. Whenever the weather is warm and the Pirates are playing, Gus and his cart can be found at the park, serving up treats to keep the summertime cool. Now, visitors can come visit the cart no matter the weather at The Miniature Railroad and Village®! Whether your favorite ice ball flavor is cherry, orange or something else, all visitors can enjoy coming to look at the bright orange cart that’s been around “since your dad was a lad!” The ice ball cart was added in 2021.

Mrs. Lampkin started her public career in 1912 and her priorities were organizing efforts to end discrimination against and oppression of all African Americans and specifically Black women. She was active in many civil, political, community, and church-affiliated groups and blazed the trail for women in the National Republican Party and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. During her tenure as a stockholder and executive at the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, she led it to become the most widely distributed Black publication in the nation. Mrs. Lampkin also led a fundraising effort in Allegheny County to raise $2 million in war bonds to support the United States during WWII. A model of the Lampkin’s three-story home in the Hill District — which served as her headquarters for teas, meetings, and strategic planning —and a figure in her likeness are now on display in the Miniature Railroad. She made an indelible mark on the future of Black Americans and American history, and the Science Center is proud to recognize her legacy in this way.

Kaufmann’s Department Store The historic installation for 2019 was Kaufmann’s Department Store, a replica of “The Grand Depot,” the original downtown mecca. Located in the Miniature Railroad’s Main Street cityscape, the model pays tribute to a Pittsburgh icon with 15 miniature window displays, a Swarovski crystal chandelier at its grand entrance, and other elegant details.

About our system The projection system features seven high powered, solid state, laser projectors – each the size of a ream of paper pictured here – that deliver on-dome visuals and 3D atmospheric effects that fill the air above the audience. Each laser appears many, many times brighter than the old argon gas system. These projectors are built exclusively by Laser Fantasy International, a Seattle-based company. The laser projection system is also “green.” The technology uses less electricity than the Science Center’s previous laser system and does not require flowing water to be cooled. The Science Center will save approximately 300,000 gallons of water per year and more than 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity – representing about 500,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.
