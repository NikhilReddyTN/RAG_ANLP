This year’s ballot is pretty straightforward for voters in Greater Pittsburgh. Unless you live in Wilkinsburg, you won’t have any local measures to vote on (more on that inside this issue). That leaves seven races for regional, statewide, and national officials, ranging from your Representative in Congress up to President of the United States. There’s one very familiar name on this ballot — former President Donald J. Trump is campaigning a third time for the country’s highest office. The themes are much the same as when he rode down his golden escalator in 2015: immigrants are “rapists;” Democrats are weak, stupid, and/or cowardly; and Trump is supposedly the only man who can save us from this quagmire. We know exactly what we’d be getting here. Accordingly, Trump’s candidate chart looks a bit different from the others in this issue. Before bubbling in your choice for President, we’d encourage you to remember life in June 2020 or January 2021. If you’d like to return to those halcyon days — or leave them firmly in the past — your decision at the top of the ballot is clear. Meanwhile, there are contests for the U.S. Senate and House and several prominent positions in Harrisburg. As befits a swing state, polls show most of these races are tight. Pennsylvania, for better or worse, is as purple as it gets in a year when just a few votes could decide the whole shebang. So, go vote. We’ve got info on the candidates, Wilkinsburg’s Home Rule decision, and the ways local antifascists are thwarting Pittsburgh’s neo-Nazis. You have until Oct. 29 to request a mail-in or absentee ballot. Otherwise, you know what to do on Nov. 5!

One of my favorite places in the city, the Aviary is home to more than 500 birds representing 150 species, many of them rare or endangered. It was among the first zoos in the nation to pioneer free-flight habitats, where birds flit past visitors uncaged, and mentioning that it might be haunted conjures images of ghost penguins or phantom fruit doves flying around the building. But the rumored specters are far stranger, and, given the site’s dark history, perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise. From 1826 to 1880, the Aviary’s location on the North Side was occupied by Western Penitentiary, the so-called sister to Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia. The prison was alleged to be less brutal than its notorious counterpart. When Charles Dickens visited America in 1842, he famously wanted to see two places: Niagara Falls and Eastern State. The latter had recently adopted a radical new system of punishment, namely solitary confinement. But, as part of Dickens’ five-month journey for his travel memoir, American Notes, the 30-year-old author also spent three days in Pittsburgh. After arriving in the city by canal boat, he made his way north to Allegheny City, not yet annexed, and saw shackled prisoners at Western Pen, where the Aviary now stands. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost As with what he’d witnessed at Eastern State, Dickens didn’t reserve his horror. He lamented to a friend in a letter, “The utter solitude by day and night; the many hours of darkness; the silence of death; the mind for ever [sic] brooding on melancholy themes, and having no relief…” He even imagined the imprisoned men being haunted by apparitions, wondering, “What if ghosts be one of the terrors of these jails?” Scholars believe Dickens later drew from his experience at Western Pen to create Jacob Marley, the chained ghost in A Christmas Carol. The Aviary site touched American history again when, in August 1863, it was pressed into service to house Confederate prisoners-of-war. Cavalrymen serving under Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan were captured after a 1,000-mile raid that ran from Tennessee to northeast Ohio. Ignoring orders from Robert E. Lee, Morgan and nearly 2,500 troops destroyed bridges, disrupted railways, and waged a campaign of terror, seizing food and supplies as they tore through the countryside. Morgan’s Raid made it farther north than any other Confederate incursion in the Civil War, ending with capture by Union forces about 40 miles from Pittsburgh. (Despite his defeat, Morgan’s Raid turned the Kentucky enslaver into a daring folk legend, though his memorial in Lexington was relocated in 2018.) More than 100 of “Morgan’s Men” were held in Western Penitentiary, with various accounts of deaths that winter, and an escape attempt. A list of the “rebel prisoners” names was published in the Daily Pittsburgh Gazette, noting almost all were officers hailed from Kentucky. The soldiers were transferred to a New Jersey military fort seven months later, “well-clothed” and “looking hale and hearty,” the Pittsburgh Gazette wrote, in March 1864. Ultimately, Western Pen relocated two miles up the Ohio River, reopening in 1882. (It operated as State Correctional Institution – Pittsburgh until 2017.) The original prison was torn down, and Pittsburgh’s first plant conservatory was established on the land until it was destroyed by a gas explosion in the 1920s. The City of Pittsburgh rebuilt the conservatory in 1952, adding birds to the indoor gardens. When city budget cuts threatened to close the Aviary in 1991, concerned North Side residents formed Save the Aviary, Inc., a private nonprofit corporation, to keep it running. The group lobbied the U.S. Congress to grant the Aviary honorary “National” status, and Pres. Bill Clinton signed the declaration in 1993. Since its opening and reopening (which also required unearthing a subterranean dungeon), people have experienced odd happenings in the building. In Haunted Western Pennsylvania, Patty A. Wilson reports Aviary staff have seen “shadowy figures that dart around” and heard “phantom footsteps through the halls” and banging noises in the basement. Birds react to unseen phenomena. Radios malfunction. In the 2013 book, Wilson recounts an oft-repeated story from a staff member who was preparing birds’ food in the morning and saw a radio flip on by itself, its dial moving “as if a ghostly hand was turning it.” With its longstanding commitment to unfettered bird life, the Aviary has understandably distanced itself from its haunted history and Western Pen. But in the 2000s, the organization invited two paranormal teams to investigate the building. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Shawn Kelly, who founded the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society in 2006, tells Pittsburgh City Paper, “The Aviary is extremely haunted.” The going theory is most of the paranormal activity emanates from wayward Confederate troops. There are apparently scattered accounts of Aviary visitors spotting figures in Civil War-era clothing. Kelly says that during the Paranormal Society’s investigation, someone caught the shadow of a soldier on film. The team also saw floating orbs in the Aviary Wetlands, “where all the birds hang out.” “It wasn't poop; it wasn't their feathers. They were very solid orbs,” Kelly says. The late Rosemary Ellen Guiley details her investigation with the International Parapsychology Research Foundation in her 2009 book Ghosthunting Pennsylvania. She brought in a Frank’s Box or “spirit box,” a modified radio scanner believed to pick up disembodied voices. Placing it in the kitchen where the ghost radio incident occurred, “a male voice said there were six communicators present.” Apparently, one copped to turning the radio dial, also saying “the communicators liked the staff members and the birds … and sometimes followed [them] around on their duties.” Wilson conveys a similar sentiment, saying the Aviary’s spirits enjoy the birds and view the building as “a peaceful place” that they “seem intent on keeping it that way.” click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Kelly is more skeptical. He asserts the Aviary is a better example of a “residual haunting,” which paranormal investigators believe happen where negative energy is stored at a site of stress or trauma. Spirits essentially get “stuck,” Kelly tells City Paper, and are unaware of anyone’s presence, “continuously [walking] the same route … like a broken record.” Accounts of 150-year-old ghosts enjoying the Aviary’s birds seems to speak to a deeper wish for a happy ending. Rather than a historical ruin, the site can be a lively, if slightly spooky, place for conservation and renewal. Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Fall Guide, National Aviary, Patty A.

Every year, the Pittsburgh Halloween staple has lured crowds with high-quality frights executed by dedicated, professional scare actors and crew members. Oscar-winning horror filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and actor Elijah Wood gave ScareHouse their approval and, in 2023, it earned the title of Top Haunt by the Haunted Attraction Association. Despite this impressive resume, ScareHouse has experienced a fair share of setbacks. In 2019, permitting issues upset an anticipated move from its longtime Etna location to the Strip District, resulting in delays and lost revenue. Then COVID hit, taking a major toll on a business specializing in interactive, in-person entertainment. Now, ScareHouse faces another obstacle. The business recently declared bankruptcy after a stint at the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills unsuccessfully returned ScareHouse to its terrifying, pre-COVID glory days. But, like a zombie character shuffling through a manufactured haunted lair, ScareHouse refuses to die. It returned this year on an appropriately spooky date (Fri., Sept. 13) with three concepts — The Basement, an extreme haunted attraction brought back after several years, the ongoing Stalked By A Serial Killer escape room, and the new, vampire-themed Chipped Fang immersive mocktail pop-up bar. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of ScareHouse A character from The Basement by ScareHouse While the 2024 season delivers comparatively smaller-scale haunts, it marks a return to ScareHouse’s roots, and a positive step toward building the Halloween attraction back up to its original form. Scott Simmons, who founded ScareHouse in 1999 with his father, Wayne, can only laugh at the last several years of misfortunes. “I just want to scare people with clowns and chainsaws; why is it so difficult?” he tells Pittsburgh City Paper. Simmons, who serves as ScareHouse’s creative director, says The Basement brings ScareHouse back to where it started, in the lower level of an over 100-year-old building that once housed the Etna Elks lodge. ScareHouse operated in Etna starting in 2007, but, after losing a majority of parking due to redevelopment, ScareHouse employed shuttles to ferry crowds from the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium parking lot, “an expensive endeavor,” according to Simmons. “We had to pay the zoo. We had to pay for buses. We had to pay for the staff,” he remembers. “And then on top of that, a lot of people didn't really enjoy the shuttle process, so they tried to find parking where they could. So then the neighbors were getting frustrated because, you know, they were losing their parking.” The ScareHouse then shifted gears in 2019 to a Strip District-based escape room that did not open in time for the Halloween season due to an unexpectedly slow permit approval process. Undeterred, the ScareHouse crew regrouped and opened the concept for Valentine’s Day in February 2020 — a month before the COVID shutdown. Despite promising opportunities to thrive at Pittsburgh Mills once the pandemic subsided, Simmons says ScareHouse had to exit due to conflicts with the mall’s ownership, which he says stopped signing the new leases required to expand operations. After years of hardships, Undead Productions, the company behind ScareHouse, filed for bankruptcy protection with the intent of fully reopening at some point. Simmons says that, even without COVID, mall drama, and other outside issues, ScareHouse was already operating at a disadvantage due to the limited run of its main attractions, which only operated from mid-September through Halloween. Simmons believes that this year will appeal to a broader array of visitors. While The Basement caters to adults looking for an intense experience, he calls Chipped Fang a “general audience, family-friendly” concept. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of ScareHouse A scene from Chipped Fang by ScareHouse “The hope is, by having The Basement and having this mocktail experience in the Strip, that essentially helps us keep the lights on for a while and keep our staff paid while we sort of figure out the long-term plans for bringing the ScareHouse back in the future in some form and location yet to be determined,” he says. So far, he says the response has been positive, citing a long line on The Basement’s opening night. The effort to build ScareHouse back up will not come at the expense of safety, an aspect that has previously helped earn accolades for the business. Simmons says that, while Basement patrons are consensually terrorized by scare actors (per the ScareHouse website, ticket holders must be 18 or over and sign a waiver to participate), precautions like safe words are used to ensure that no one gets hurt. The focus on safety is encouraging given past controversy around extreme haunted attractions being accused of going too far, most notoriously McKamey Manor in Tennessee, which reportedly subjected its patrons to actual assault and torture, including being held underwater. Simmons says that, while The Basement is “meant to be a bit more psychological and a bit more disturbing and more tactile,” they don’t want anyone to feel as though they are trapped. “We want you to know that you are choosing to do this and if at any point you don't enjoy it, or you're not having fun, you can always stop it,” he explains. “It really is the true way it is supposed to work.” Even so, he says some patrons have left wanting more. “I had a guest come out the other night and he was unhappy because he had not been slapped,” Simmons laughs. “That's a whole different thing, sir.” Simmons says that, even with an uncertain future, he feels buoyed by the commitment of ScareHouse patrons and staff members, some of whom have worked for the company for over 10 years. “It’s remarkable how, even with all of our hardships, we still have so many of the core staff and core cast and crew sticking by us, and the fan response so far has been really encouraging,” says Simmons. “ScareHouse means a lot to a lot of people … A lot of the weirdos, a lot of the misfits, a lot of the alternative people, this gives them a chance to be creative and get out of their comfort zone and perform.” ScareHouse presents The Basement.

Fall has arrived, and that means it’s spooky season. Legend holds that as nights grow longer, the veil separating the material and spiritual worlds thins, bringing haunted happenings and unseen forces. For whatever reason, the veil in Pittsburgh has always been extra permeable, and the region boasts a preponderance of places believed to be haunted. For this year’s Fall Guide, Pittsburgh City Paper zeroed in on some of our favorite haunted restaurants and bars (and the list we offer is by no means complete). From a ghost lady in white to a haunted railroad station to a lurid Biddle brothers connection, these eerie establishments are sure to make your hair stand on end — or at least offer a storied place to grab a beer. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost The Abbey on Butler Street 4635 Butler St., Lawrenceville. theabbeyonbutlerstreet.com One theory about why Pittsburgh locales are so haunted is that buildings go through so many renovations. In this respect, The Abbey on Butler Street stands a head above, as the huge cruciform-shaped space in Lawrenceville was formerly a Methodist church, a brass foundry, and a funeral home, converted during the Great Depression. The Abbey’s website details all the artifacts uncovered during its “massive” remodel: industrial foundry lights above what’s now its coffeehouse; a church hall formerly at 47th St. and Butler St.; and the remnants of a stone-carving business that was transformed into a patio and bar. Today, The Abbey evokes an otherworldly past. The softly-lit coffeehouse, pub, and bistro is decorated with Old World-style heavy wood, reclaimed stained glass windows, vintage signs, and gold medieval script that winds throughout the building. Naturally, most of the haunting rumors are tied to the former funeral home. Staff have reported seeing ghostly figures and hearing doors slam on their own. “Respectfully, we honor the lives and all of loved ones that met here to send off what some refer to as the Greatest Generation,” the restaurant wrote on its website. Shawn Kelly, founder of the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society (and one of the only ghost hunters to explore the National Aviary), tells City Paper, “Funeral homes are the best. I love funeral homes.” Kelly has investigated a handful of the haunted restaurants on our list. In his opinion, funeral homes become haunted not simply because the dead passed through them, but because a family-owned funeral parlor offers some measure of comfort. “I think a lot of spirits feel comfortable at a funeral home because it’s [a] somewhat decent [place],” he says. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson / CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Head brewer Matt Moninger takes CP on a tour of Church Brew Works and the old school building they use for storage. Grand Concourse Restaurant 100 W. Station Square Dr., South Side. grandconcourserestaurant.com One look at the Grand Concourse and I’m willing to believe the rumors of Station Square’s death are greatly exaggerated. The upscale restaurant — which boasts “unmatched grandeur” and is a perennial pick for Best Brunch in CP’s Best of PGH Readers’ Poll — was originally the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, which opened in 1901. In 1976, the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation began converting the entire freight yard site into Station Square, establishing the Landmarks Building. Within it, they turned the historic railroad terminal, with its marble columns, cathedral ceilings, and Victorian and Edwardian architecture, into the Grand Concourse Restaurant. Haunting rumors have persisted since. The Haunted Pittsburgh ghost tour compiled stories about the restaurant. After hours, there are apparently “creepy otherworldly sounds.” A kitchen worker “confided” that faucets turn on by themselves. Morning staff discover objects knocked over or misplaced overnight. Once, a cart of dishes was found dumped on the floor; managers played back security video to see the same cart untouched all night. Apparently the hauntings extend to the entire Landmarks Building (which also houses the Foundation’s offices). In April 2004, visitors reported being terrified after glimpsing a “white translucent figure” in a corridor. The specter was hovering mid-air with one arm draped over a railing. Not exactly what you expect to see, even after some strong mimosas. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Max’s Allegheny Tavern 537 Suismon St., North Side. maxsalleghenytavern.com There’s something spirits love about the North Side. Before Pittsburgh officially had an H in its name and Allegheny City was a separate municipality, the area was developed by German-speaking (and later Croatian) immigrants, with many buildings from that time still in existence today. Max’s Allegheny Tavern, a staple in the Deutschtown neighborhood, began as a grocery store nearly 175 years ago. In 1860, it became Farmers and Drovers Hotel (later the Hotel Rahn), and the contours of the original hotel survived into the 21st century. Reopened as Max’s in 1903, the tavern has always been family-run, specializing in traditional German fare including potato pancakes, sausages, Bavarian soft pretzels, and “the great schnitzels of Europe.” The restaurant has also kept touches from prior centuries with two antique five-door wooden ice boxes, now used for storage, and is furnished with solid wood and Tiffany-style stained glass for an Old World aura. With such a storied history, hauntings should come as no surprise. Largely, the family seems to keep the tavern’s supernatural happenings under wraps, but a couple years after forming the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society in 2006, Shawn Kelly and the team were invited by a friend to explore. “They knew it was haunted. They were OK with the ghost[s] in there,” Kelly tells CP. “They just wanted to see what they [had].” Objects had been moved around. Bartenders heard whispers and disembodied voices while getting ice and beer from the stone-walled basement (also reportedly a speakeasy during Prohibition). In the old hotel space upstairs, heavy oak doors slammed by themselves. Kelly says the paranormal team investigated using cutting-edge technology, which in the late 2000s meant digital cameras and voice recorders. “There was a lot of activity in there, and it was all good,” he remembers. Apparently, the ghosts felt attached to the old neighborhood. “It was mainly the spirits from that time when the North Side was really picking up … [around when Max’s opened] when it was in its heyday,” Kelly says. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Penn Brewery 800 Vinial St., North Side. pennbrew.com Penn Brewery is Pittsburgh’s oldest and largest brewery, which naturally comes with its share of spooky tales. Though the modern Penn Brewery that Pittsburghers know began in 1986, the site was originally settled by the Germans of Deutschtown, including the Eberhardt and Ober families. Breweries existed on the site as far back as 1848, and, before refrigeration, brewers kept barrels of beer cool in what Penn Brewery’s website describes as “a labyrinth of stone caves and tunnels.” These lagering caves remain today — some of only a handful left in the United States, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places — perpetually kept dark and chilly at 55 degrees. Odd things have been spotted in the dungeon-like subterranean caves. Hauntings at Penn Brewery don’t end there. According to the brewery, the women’s bathroom is “notoriously particularly haunted.” Visitors should also stay wary of the basement, where a new employee was recently assisted by a man in suspenders who showed her where the brewery’s to-go boxes were. After going back upstairs and telling two kitchen workers about the man who helped her, they informed her that no one else was in the building except the three of them. Later, another employee saw the same man in suspenders in the brewery’s lobby. Harold’s Haunt 142 Grant Ave., Millvale. haroldshaunt.wixsite.com/haroldshaunt Completing the North-of-the-Allegheny trifecta, Harold’s Haunt sits in the heart of ultra-haunted Millvale. The newest establishment on our list, the witchy-themed “haunted they bar” and inclusive LGBTQ space has already embraced its many ghostly connections. Harold’s is named after the ghost from the bar’s sister business, metaphysical and LGBTQ gift shop Maude’s Paperwing Gallery. After owner Athena Flint opened Maude’s in 2021, she noticed a malevolent presence (Flint describes the experience on the podcast Ghoul on Ghoul, hosted by CP’s A&E Editor Amanda Waltz). Electronic devices would fritz out, and a medium who visited the store — now located above Harold’s — picked up on the poltergeist energy. The Maude’s team hired a medium to communicate with the surly ghost, revealing he was a 60-year-old man caught in a “time loop” who apparently made racist and sexist remarks. In an ironic turn, the team dubbed the ghost Harold and named the bar after him (even creating a mustachioed version for the Harold’s logo). But they found out shortly after that the space came with its own spirits. While setting up the bar, Flint brought in a box of tarot cards and witnessed three cocktail strainers launch out of a glass. An unseen force (now believed to be the ghost of a former bar owner, Paul) also intervened at a crucial moment, when a light inexplicably turned on inside the dark bar. The light alerted Flint and friends to a cooler leaking directly over an electric outlet. Flint and her friend Ringa Sunn recently recounted the incident, which they believe averted a fire, to paranormal investigators at Bump in the Night Society. This is just a taste of the many haunted happenings at Harold’s, where you can regularly catch spooky events like a Dark Histories Walking Tour of Millvale, a funeral-themed second anniversary celebration, and full moon parties. Shiloh Gastro 123 Shiloh St., Mt. Washington. shilohgastro.com Shiloh Gastro has the distinction of not only being a haunted hotspot, but connected to Pittsburgh’s most infamous true crime. The Victorian house-turned-gastropub atop Mt. Washington was the family home of Kate Soffel, the woman who risked it all to spring the Biddle brothers from Allegheny County Jail in 1902. Soffel, who was married to the warden and ministered to condemned men, met the brothers on death row. Though they’d been convicted of a string of robberies that left a grocer dead, the dashing younger Biddle, Ed, pled innocence. Soffel, a 35-year-old mother of four, became infatuated with 24-year-old Ed. She smuggled in a file to saw through his cell bars and the trio broke out. Ed and Kate are believed to have consummated their affair before being caught by police. Both brothers were shot and killed, while Soffel tried to shoot herself but survived. Today, her ghost supposedly waits around the house on Shiloh St. pining for her dead boy toy to return. CP visited Shiloh Gastro to investigate the haunting rumors and it more than delivered. Staff reported smelling cigarette smoke — supposedly coming from the Soffels’ former bedroom — hearing phantom noises, and seeing floating orbs in the upstairs dining room. The women’s bathroom is known to conjure Soffel herself, and when I went in alone and called her name, the lights flickered and my phone froze. Go for the comfort food and patio, then try out this Beetlejuice maneuver if you dare. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson / CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Head brewer Matt Moninger describes his encounter with a spirit at Church Brew Works. Church Brew Works 3525 Liberty Ave., Lawrenceville. churchbrew.com Though long rumored to be haunted, Church Brew Works was catapulted to a new level of fame when it was featured on a 2022 episode of Ghost Hunters. Paranormal investigators were called to “The Most Haunted Brewery” at the behest of longtime owner Sean Casey, who, at least for purposes of the show, was concerned staff were getting too spooked. In the episode, a Church Brew Works accountant reports seeing a chair move on its own. A cook feels followed in the kitchen. Other staff hear footsteps, phantom voices, and faint music from the church organ when no one else is in the building. Naturally, the ghost hunters look into the Church Brew Works’ former life as St. John the Baptist Church, established in 1902 to serve Lawrenceville’s Irish and Scottish Catholic parishioners. The sprawling original property included a convent (which Casey recently purchased), a school, and the rectory, which became the brewery’s kitchen, all out of sight for patrons today. Filming over three nights, the Ghost Hunters team posted up in an especially dark and derelict part of the former school, spoke to a wayward spirit or two — even claiming to pick up a worshipful ghost rasping “Jesus” on an electronic recording — and considered the case closed. Church Brew Works Head Brewer Matt Moninger tells CP that, for him, the reality is more complex than the reality TV. Moninger shares the most spectacular story in the Ghost Hunters episode, describing his encounters with a pale young woman — he puts her age at 16 to 22 — in a long white dress. Though he can’t recall exact dates, he was working as a brewer in 2006-7, in his late 20s, and she ultimately appeared four times over several months before vanishing. He first glimpsed her going up the old rectory steps that connect to the brewery’s kitchen. Initially, Moninger thought the specter was a server he didn’t recognize. “She wasn't somebody who had vampire teeth or six-inch claws or [who was] hissing at me,” he remembers. “She seemed to be [a] kind of lost, maybe scared, needing help, sort of apparition who just seemed to be out of place.” “Don’t get me wrong … it’s off-putting,” he adds. “It wasn't normal … but she wasn't terrifying or even aggressive in any way, shape, or form. So it was hard for me to frame it that way.” Another peculiarity was that only he could see the ghost, even though she appeared in the busiest parts of the restaurant. She manifested at a table along the apse at the front of the church and behind the altar where there are visible brew tanks. But the final sighting was a private moment of communion, and Moninger remembers it vividly. Walking out of the kitchen one morning, he suddenly spotted the ghost five to 10 feet away, among the restaurant’s tables. “She was standing right there, just looking at me,” he tells CP. “We were just making eye contact for [maybe] one to 10 seconds. I have no idea … Even just talking about it gives me goosebumps because it was just that intense.” “I don't know how to describe it, because there’s absolutely nothing romantic about this,” he says. “But it's just like when you lock eyes with somebody that you feel passionate about and you have that feeling of something's leaving your body and going into theirs, and something’s leaving theirs and coming into yours. It’s like you have this fixation. That's kind of like what it was [like], really intensely, and then she was just gone … After that, I never saw her again.” The “weirdest part” Moninger believes, is that the ghost didn’t fade or “poof out of existence” like in a cartoon. She simply disappeared as if never there, leaving him “struck or mesmerized.” Moninger is particular about how he describes the apparition. He doesn’t want to come across as narcissistic or paternalistic or imply the ghost was a “damsel in distress” uniquely in need of his help. For her, “nothing came out of it,” he tells CP. “I chased her around the building a couple of times … I would have been the scary one in that situation.” Conversely, seeing her changed him. For Moninger, it engendered an interest in the paranormal, neuropsychology, and human consciousness. He remains “agnostic” about trying to assign a definitive explanation to the experience — profound as it was — or even make basic assumptions like the ghost being a dead person. In the years since, the encounter expanded his view of reality. “We[’ve] evolved to see what we need to see in order to survive,” he says. “This is tiny compared to the electromagnetic spectrum … we live in [a] tiny, itty bitty sliver of the universe.” Even resisting complete explanation, Moninger admits that the ghost sightings steered the course of his career 15 years later. After leaving Church Brew Works in 2014, he returned to film the Ghost Hunters episode in 2021, and ultimately came back aboard as head brewer. “Rather than me helping her,” he says, the common interpretation, “she was responsible for bringing me back here.” Slideshow A haunting at Church Brew Works Click to View 22 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Fall Guide, Harold's Haunt, Church Brew Works, Shiloh Gastro, Penn Brewery, The Abbey, Grand Concourse, Max's Allegheny Tavern, Slideshow Related Content Salem's shuts down, Bae Bae's opens late, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 18, 2025 The Wegmans cometh, Title 9 toasts women's sports, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 21, 2025 Pittsburgh’s oldest restaurants still serve up new delights By Rachel Wilkinson Dec 4, 2024 Pittsburgh’s top holiday events: Nov. 21-Dec. 31 By CP Staff Nov 20, 2024 More from Fall Guide ‌The big, spooky Pittsburgh event guide: Oct. 3-Oct. 31 By CP Staff Oct 2, 2024 Ghost hunters say the National Aviary is “extremely haunted” By Rachel Wilkinson Oct 2, 2024 ScareHouse heads back to the basement after several difficult years By Amanda Waltz Oct 2, 2024 More » More Fall Guide All Specials & Guides Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Affordable-ish Housing in Pittsburgh: the dark gods of Zillow edition By Michael Machosky Mar 14, 2025 What is the best pierogi at Polska Laska?
