    "description": "Helene Alving has spent her life suspended in an emotional void after the death of her cruel but outwardly charming husband. She’s about to dedicate an orphanage she has built in his memory, and she reveals to a previous admirer, Pastor Manders, that her marriage was a miserable one. Manders had advised her to return to her husband despite his philandering, and she followed that advice in the belief that her love for her husband would eventually reform him. Now Helene is determined to escape the ghosts of her past by telling her son, Oswald, the truth about his father. But on his return from his life as a painter in France, Oswald has his own secrets to share. As the truth spirals out, Helene and her son must confront the harsh realities of their past, and what it will mean for their future.\nWritten by Henrik Ibsen\nDirected by Carlos E.

A charming mix of open mic nights and live theater, each month Story Club selects a theme and welcomes volunteer and spotlight storytellers to the stage. No matter the theme, strangers and friends always show up with a story to tell, each new perspective reminding us of all the ways we are connected and all the ways we make this life our own.\nThe Center is reserving 10-15 tickets for students. We will confirm your participation with an email and meet you at Alphabet City at 6:45 PM the day of the event!",

    "description": "How can we find and synthesize all of the existing research on a topic when there is so much information out there? Scoping reviews are a popular research synthesis method for systematically describing the existing literature on a topic. They are more reproducible and comprehensive than a traditional literature review and can help us to understand the scope of research in an area, identify existing gaps, and surface trends and key concepts.\nIf you are considering developing a research synthesis project for your field, or are curious about such methods and how they apply in your discipline, please join us! You’ll be provided with guidance and next steps for starting a scoping review at the end of the session.\nThis session is aimed at graduate students, staff and faculty researchers, but anyone is welcome to join.\nRegistration is required.\nThis is Part 2 of the Advanced and Systematized Literature Review Methods Workshop series. Join us for one or any of these sessions. Other workshops in the series:\nPart 1: Tools, Techniques and Strategies for Efficient and Effective Literature Reviews - Monday, Feb. 3, Noon-1 p.m. ET\nPart 3: Managing Collaborative Literature Reviews with Sysrev - Monday, March 17, Noon-1 p.m. ET\nPart 4: Analyzing Scholarly Literature Using Bibliometrics - Monday, April 7, Noon-1 p.m. ET",

    "description": "Shortly after the 1918 pandemic, the word “robot” was coined in a play about mechanical workers organizing a rebellion to defeat their human overlords. A century later, emerging advances in artificial intelligence and robotics, fueled by venture capital and governments, are disrupting labor, trade and political stability. Claims about “superintelligence” and existential threats to humanity raise new questions about the essential distinctions between humans and machines.\nTo contextualize a series of his artworks that explore this boundary, Goldberg references Sigmund Freud’s “Uncanny” (1919) and Masahiro Mori’s “Uncanny Valley” (1970). Goldberg will share robot paintings from his first art exhibit at CMU and art installations such as “The Telegarden” (1995-2004), a living garden tended by a robot operated by more than 100,000 visitors over the Internet, and “AlphaGarden” (2020-), a fully automated garden that took an unexpected twist during the pandemic.\nLearn more about the event and speaker\nSponsored by the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, School of Computer Science, and Robotics Institute",

    "date": "March 20, 2025",
    "time_location": "5 - 7 p.m.\nBaker Hall, A53 Steinberg Auditorium",
    "description": "“Spaces of Treblinka” utilizes testimonies, oral histories and recollections from Jewish, German and Polish witnesses to create a holistic representation of the Treblinka death camp during its operation. This narrative rejects the historical misconception that Treblinka was an isolated Nazi extermination camp with few witnesses and fewer survivors. Rather than the secret, sanitized site of industrial killing Treblinka was intended to be, Jacob Flaws argues, Treblinka’s mass murder was well known to the nearby townspeople who experienced the sights, sounds, smells, people, bodies and train cars the camp ejected into the surrounding world.\nThrough spatial reality, Flaws portrays the conceptions, fantasies, ideological assumptions and memories of Treblinka from witnesses in the camp and surrounding towns. To do so he identifies six key spaces that once composed the historical site of Treblinka: the ideological space, the behavioral space, the space of life and death, the interactional space, the sensory space, and the extended space. By examining these spaces, Flaws reveals that there were more witnesses to Treblinka than previously realized, as the transnational groups near and within the camp overlapped and interacted. “Spaces of Treblinka” provides a staggering and profound reassessment of the relationship between knowing and not knowing and asks us to confront the timely warning that we, in our modern, interconnected world, can all become witnesses.\nThe conversation will be moderated by Michal Rose Friedman, the Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies in the Department of History at CMU.\nSponsored by CMU’s Department of History and Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies, in partnership with Classrooms Without Borders, the University of Pittsburgh Jewish Studies Program and the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh.",

However, satellite congestion, space debris, and threats like energy weapons and anti-satellite missiles pose a significant risk. DeNardis will discuss the governance considerations needed as we work towards building a secure solar-system Internet, including the security implications of shifting stakeholders from nation-states to private entities.\nLaura DeNardis is professor and endowed chair in technology, ethics and society at Georgetown University. A scholar of cybersecurity and technology governance, DeNardis was listed as one of thirty-two Innovators Building a Better Future by Wired UK. Among her many books, The Internet in Everything: Freedom and Security in a World with No Off Switch was listed as a Financial Times Top Technology Book of 2020 and her book The Global War for Internet Governance is considered a definitive source for understanding conflicts in cyberspace. DeNardis is an affiliated fellow of the Yale Information Society Project, where she previously served as executive director. She served as the research director of the Global Commission on Internet Governance from 2014 to 2016. She holds an engineering science degree from Dartmouth, an MS in engineering from Cornell, a PhD in science and technology studies from Virginia Tech, and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship from Yale Law School.\nRegister for the event",
