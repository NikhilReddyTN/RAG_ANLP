Time left to complete order Manfred Honeck Music Director Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s\r\n          leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations\r\n          receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the\r\n          Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the\r\n          2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home\r\n          and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural\r\n          ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include\r\n          Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major\r\n          venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg\r\n          Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival,\r\n          Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads\r\n          the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour,\r\n          starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the\r\n          prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively\r\n          documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring\r\n          works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,\r\n          Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding\r\n          reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the\r\n          orchestra won the GRAMMY® for \"Best Orchestral Performance\" in 2018.\r\n          The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with\r\n          Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical\r\n          acclaim. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the\r\n          University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a\r\n          member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna\r\n          State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a\r\n          conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination\r\n          to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his\r\n          conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of\r\n          the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the\r\n          Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize\r\n          in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of\r\n          the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian\r\n          National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic\r\n          Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the\r\n          Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he\r\n          was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,\r\n          following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his\r\n          four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he\r\n          conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,\r\n          Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses\r\n          such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la\r\n          Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg\r\n          Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new\r\n          staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In\r\n          autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, \r\n          leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo . Beyond the\r\n          podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,\r\n          including Janáček’s Jenůfa , Strauss’s Elektra , Dvořák’s Rusalka as\r\n          well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the\r\n          globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Salome , was premiered\r\n          by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading\r\n          international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,\r\n          Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,\r\n          Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw\r\n          Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di\r\n          Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States,\r\n          he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York\r\n          Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los\r\n          Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony\r\n          Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic\r\n          Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty\r\n          years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging\r\n          programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all\r\n          four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will\r\n          return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony,\r\n          Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and\r\n          Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's\r\n          anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on\r\n          the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in\r\n          the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by\r\n          the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International\r\n          Classical Music Awards declared him \"Artist of the Year\".

Time left to complete order Frequently Asked Questions Pre-Performance How can I order tickets? Tickets for most events are on sale 24 hours/day from our online calendar . The Heinz Hall Box Office hours are Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 PM, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Tickets may be purchased by calling 412.392.4900 Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 pm, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Services charges apply to phone and Internet orders. When can I arrive for concerts? Our doors open one hour prior to classical concerts and one hour prior for all other performances. For a relaxing and enjoyable experience, we encourage you to arrive early, particularly if you need to stop at the box office. How do I print my tickets at home? If you selected to print your tickets at home in the purchase path, you can follow the instructions here to print them. What are your security policies? Entrance Security Policy All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Bag and Personal Belongings Policy Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances. Costume Policy Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars ) in costume. What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system? In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What if I don't want to go through the scanner? An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check. Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women? The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check. Is screening the the same at every concert or event? As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What makes the system \"smart\" and what will you do with the video images? The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall. What should I wear to concerts? There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable. May I bring my children? Introducing small children to music is important to the PSO and we welcome young children to our youth concerts and Fiddlesticks Family Concerts. Children, approximately age six and over, are welcome at all performances with a purchased ticket (please see Safely Together for current mask and vaccination requirements). The Latecomer's Gallery and lobby video monitors are always options for restless children. Will there be dinner service in the Mozart Room? We do not anticipate the Mozart Room reopening in the near future. Please patronize our dining partners around Heinz Hall . Do you have a pre-concert \"rush\" program? Yes. Beginning two hours prior to most BNY Mellon Grand Classics and PNC Pops performances, students and seniors (age 62+) may purchase discounted rush tickets. Rush tickets are subject to availability and are restricted to certain seating sections. Students and seniors must present valid identification and may purchase one discounted ticket per person. Please note that rush pricing is subject to change. In order to guarantee seating availability, we suggest purchasing tickets prior to the day of the concert you wish to attend. Please note that the PSO offers discounted student and senior subscriptions, which offer the best savings as well as exclusive benefits. For more information on students and senior subscriptions, please click here. Can I organize a group for a concert? Absolutely. With a group ticket purchase you receive discounted tickets, priority seats, personalized service and free reception space. For more information, call 412.392.4819 or visit our website at pittsburghsymphony.org/groups Are there any other services that I should be aware of? The Concierge Service, in the Entrance Lobby, is available to assist with information about Heinz Hall, the Cultural District and area attractions and to help with dining, hotel, entertainment and transportation concerns as well as lost and found. Where can I find Heinz Hall policies? Heinz Hall policies can be found on our website . Can I check my coat? Coin-operated lockers are located on the Lower and Gallery levels. How will I find parking? Pittsburgh's Cultural District can be very busy but guaranteed prepaid parking is available to all ticket holders in the Sixth & Penn garage across from Heinz Hall. You may purchase prepaid parking when you order your tickets. If you have a smartphone, the ParkPGH app helps you to locate available garage parking near the Cultural District on the go. Performance When should I applaud? Applause is usually appropriate at the end of a piece (when the conductor lowers his hands). In a multi-movement work, it is customary to wait until the end of the last movement to applaud, so as not to break the concentration of the performers. What if I have to cough? The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra provides complimentary cough drops at the concierge desk located in the entrance lobby. May I take pictures? Unless otherwise announced in the program and at the concert, the use of still, video and digital cameras or audio recording equipment is strictly prohibited at all times in the concert hall. You are more than welcome to take photos and video in the lobbies and garden area of Heinz Hall. What if I arrive late? There is a Latecomer's Gallery, located behind the Main Floor, which affords patrons who arrive after the beginning of a concert the opportunity to enjoy the performance until they can be seated. Latecomers will be seated at suitable intervals during the program, at the discretion of the conductor. The Latecomer's Gallery is also available for parents with younger children. What accessible services are available at Heinz Hall? The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Heinz Hall are committed to providing an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all patrons. For information about our accessible services, please contact the box office at 412.392.4900 or visit our Accessibility page. Are refreshments available at Heinz Hall? Bar service is available pre-concert and at intermission for Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts. Where are restrooms located in Heinz Hall?

Would she die for love? When painter Cavaradossi—the lover of Rome’s enchanting diva Floria Tosca—decides to harbor a fugitive of the law, he makes himself and his beloved Tosca a target of the corrupt Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all. Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours. See why Tosca is one of the most powerful operas ever written. These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”). ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death. - Adapted from Opera News DETAILS AND RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza. Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed. PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people. ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking. ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. Act 1 Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed by news that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. He offers his kingdom and Armida’s hand in marriage to the Christian knight Rinaldo if he agrees to fight against his fellow Christians. Enchanted and obsessed with Armida, Rinaldo vows to betray his men and his faith. Meanwhile, Armida, tormented by her passionate love for Rinaldo, pleads with the gods for his safety. Scene 2: A mountainside. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarca plan to rescue Rinaldo from Armida’s enchantment. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians. However, upon encountering Clotarca, Zelmira falls in love with her, despite her better judgment, and offers to lead her to safety. Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of Idreno’s approaching forces. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo about Armida’s charms and chastises him for abandoning his Christian duty. Though remorseful, Rinaldo remains unable to break free from Armida’s enchantment. Act 2 Scene 1: Back in the council chamber. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarca's demand that the Christian knight enchanted by Armida be freed. Though the spell is broken, Rinaldo reluctantly leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury. Scene 2: Back at the mountainside. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo back as he prepares to rejoin the crusaders in battle. Armida arrives, pleading for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo, torn but resolute, departs for battle with Ubaldo, leaving Armida betrayed and alone. Act 3 Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, aware that the myrtle tree holds the secret to Armida’s powers, enters the grove to destroy it. Zelmira and a group of nymphs appear, attempting to persuade him to return to Armida. As Rinaldo raises his weapon to strike the myrtle, a disheveled Armida emerges from the tree and confronts him. Unable to kill Rinaldo despite her fury, she watches as he strikes the tree, causing the magic wood to fall lifeless. As Rinaldo tries to escape, he declares to still love her. Armida, consumed by fury, turns into a monster of rage, destroying all in her path.

Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera , Detroit Opera , and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy. These performances are sponsored in part by generous gifts from Caroline & Mary Barensfeld, Daniel G. & Carole L. Kamin, Glenmede, and The Galliot Fund.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings. This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon ( Cold Mountain ) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

REGISTER HERE! Each Family Day event consists of different activities designed to expose children, teens, and their families to some of the many different components that make up opera. This year's Family Day will open with a 30-minute concert featuring our Resident Artists. This concert is not open to the general public and is only for Family Day attendees. Attendees then will be invited to participate in hands-on activities related to elements of opera and Japanese culture in celebration of Pittsburgh Opera's upcoming production of Madama Butterfly . Origami – Learn the Japanese art of paper folding and make your very own creation! Voice Lesson – A voice lesson led by a member of Pittsburgh Opera. Children will learn about different voice types, how to use proper breath support, how to project their voices, and more. Fukuwarai – Play a traditional Japanese New Year’s celebration game that is a bit like pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and definitely just as silly and fun! Costume Activity – Make your very own accessories – butterfly headbands or Pikachu ears! – to finalize your look and get ready to go out on stage. Participants will rotate throughout the four activities. Each participant and group will participate in all four activities. There is no minimum age to attend. Parents/guardians must accompany children younger than high school age, so they can enjoy the activities with their children. Each family will receive a free goody bag at the end of the event.

You can buy a Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass by calling 412-281-0912 ext. 3, or you can order online . How long does my Opus Pass last? Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are valid for one year from its date of issue. Your Opus Pass will automatically renew unless you take action to make changes or cancel. When does my Opus Pass 'start'? If you purchase your Opus Pass between June-September 2024, it will activate as of October 1st, in time for the first opera of our 2024-25 season. Your billing cycle will begin in early October. If you purchase your Opus Pass on or after October 1, 2024, it is valid for one year from the date of purchase. What if I buy an Opus Pass after the season is already underway? Since your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes is valid for one year from its date of issue, you will be able to use your Pass for any Pittsburgh Opera performances in the following season that fall within one year of purchase. For example, if you purchase a Pass in December 2024, you will be able to use it for all our remaining 2024-25 Season performances, as well as our October and November 2024 performances, even though they are part of our 2025-26 season. How do you bill me? Your credit card will be charged once each calendar month. Patrons who buy an Opus Pass will be charged monthly from date of purchase. Can I pay for the whole year upfront? Yes. If you choose our one-time payment option, you will save $20, i.e. you will get one month free. My credit card's expiration date is before my Opus Pass expires. What should I do? Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 with your updated credit card information prior to your card expiring. Is it possible to cancel my Opus Pass before it expires? If you need to cancel your Opus Pass before it expires, you can choose to receive a refund for the difference in value between what you've paid so far for your Pass and the normal single ticket face value price of any tickets you redeemed. For example, if you had been a Passholder for six months and paid $120 for your Pass so far, and you'd redeemed your Pass for one ticket which had a regular price of $110, you would be eligible for a $10 refund. If you have redeemed your Pass for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever do that of course! All future ticket reservations will be forfeited upon cancellation of membership. There are no refunds retroactively after your Pass expires. FAQS - TICKET REDEMPTION How do I redeem my Pass for a ticket to a specific performance? Simply email us , fill out your Opus Pass Ticket Redemption Form, or call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 as early as five days or as late as 3 hours prior to the performance. How far in advance can I redeem my Pass for a specific performance? Ticket redemption opens five days before each performance and is available up to three hours before showtime. Where will you seat me? For performances at the Benedum Center, you will be given the best available seats, excluding Zone A. Specific seat assignments are not guaranteed. Can I request a specific seating location? Yes. You can specify whether you prefer to sit on the Orchestra Level (i.e. the main floor) or the Balcony Level, whether you prefer to be on House Left, House Right, on or close to an aisle vs. in the middle of a row, etc. You can also request to be seated next to other specific Opus Passholders or ticketholders, e.g. 'Please seat me next to my friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'. If you need an accessible seat, e.g. for a wheelchair, please let us know. Pittsburgh Opera will do our best to honor specific seating requests. But please know that specific seat assignments are not guaranteed, and are subject to availability. Where do I pick up my tickets? At Will Call. Please remember to bring photo ID. What if a performance is already sold out? If a performance is already sold out when a Passholder tries to redeem their Pass for a ticket, they will have the option of being placed on the Wait List, and will be eligible to use tickets released by other patrons. What if I end up not being able to attend a performance I redeemed my Pass for? We understand that unexpected circumstances may prevent you from attending a performance which you've redeemed your Pass for. If that happens, please let us know at least one hour prior to the performance so that we can release your ticket. Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera. FAQS - GENERAL QUESTIONS Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it? No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together? It depends. If you and your partner always attend the opera together, i.e. you always buy two seats together, and you plan on attending at least three performances this coming season together, then you should buy two Opus Passes - one for you and one for your partner. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. If your \"+1\" guest changes from show to show - sometimes your significant other comes with you, but other times you bring a neighbor, friend, or work colleague - you should not buy two Opus Passes, because each Pass is issued in a specific person's name. Instead, when you redeem your Pass for a specific performance, mention that you need to add on a second ticket. You can purchase additional tickets at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance? Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together. I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I? Yes! Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you. Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them? No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund. Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events? Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas ) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately. FAQS - OPUS PASS SUBSCRIPTION ADD ON I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass ? Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. Subscribers who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price. Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription? If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly? Subscribers who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments. Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway? Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost. If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On? If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

The risks of buying from a reseller include: You may pay more than face value. Your tickets may not be real. Your tickets may not be able to be replaced when lost or stolen. Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us. Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information. Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value. Resellers go to great lengths to come up first in Google search results, and often use official-sounding names such as \"Ticket Network\", \"Box Office Ticket Sales\", \"Ticket Smarter\", \"Ticket City\", and so on. Don't be fooled! SEATING CHARTS Benedum Center Seating Chart Click here to view a detailed seating chart (PDF) for the Benedum Center, our principal performance space.

Photo credit: David Bachman Striving for accessibility throughout the organization Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances. Inclusion at Pittsburgh Opera Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company. CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage. These are sometimes referred to as \"OpTrans\". AUDIO COMMENTARY Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory. Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the \"pre-show\". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the \"play-by-play\". Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby. ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid. The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Infrared: Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is audio amplification only. Channel 2 on the Infrared Hearing Devices includes music and Audio Commentary Inductive Loop: If a patron's hearing aid has a Telecoil or Phone Position setting, the hearing aid can be worn and a special headset with an inductive loop system can be used (and worn around the neck). Infrared hearing devices cannot be used in the ears with a hearing aid. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume. SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance , and are subject to the availability of an interpreter. To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600. Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do. Video by Abbie Whitehurst BRAILLE AND LARGE PRINT PROGRAMS Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby. Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list. SENSORY WORKSHOPS Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department.

The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers for Armida and/or Madama Butterfly add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. HOW TO ADD A RIDESHARE VOUCHER TO YOUR TICKET PURCHASE: 1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box: (See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:) 2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page: 3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for: 4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu: You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance. You can then check Check Out as usual. HOW DOES IT WORK? Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records. At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this: Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them. Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you. FAQS When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can. Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine. What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages. What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free. Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use. I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage , or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber. Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food. I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases. What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient. I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal? As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

Audio Commentary Service Pittsburgh Opera offers an Audio Commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the Tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified). Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling 412-281-0912, extension 213. An all-volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. An audio describer reads from the program book ten minutes before the performance—the \"pre-show\"—and then reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage during the performance—the \"play-by-play\". We're thankful to our volunteers who provide this service each season! Pittsburgh Opera Audio Commentary Team— Julia, Ray, Jan, Donna, and Mary Ann Braille and Large-Print Programs Braille and large-print programs are available at each performance. Hearing Assistance Infrared hearing devices are available at our Benedum Center performances. Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is for audio amplification. Sign Language Interpretation Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Please see our accessibility webpage for details. Opera Study Guides The Study Guides for each opera are posted in PDF format on the Pittsburgh Opera website in advance of the opera's opening, and are available in paper form at all performances, in the lobby area.

However, we will be posting comparable bonus content in our Facebook and YouTube chats during the free livestreams.

When using the App during a performance: Please silence all phone alerts and ringtones prior to the performance Audio content will only be delivered if you have headphones plugged into your phone or are using a Bluetooth headset Please refrain from using your phone for anything other than the app - no texting, social media, emailing, etc. Please be respectful of other patrons when using the app. Hold your phone in your lap - do not hold it up to eye level where it could distract the people sitting next to or behind you Download from Google Play Download in the Apple App Store Funding for the Pittsburgh Opera Mobile App is generously provided by an OPERA America Innovation Grant from the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation , and by the Hillman Foundation . APP BACKGROUND Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events. The app is powered by Instant Encore , the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe. In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note ®. Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center , LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e.g. text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances. Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel . Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences. Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation , Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®. We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined , and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season. Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons. After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users. With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season. We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

MADAMA BUTTERFLY CHILD SUPERNUMERARY Download the full casting call here. Pittsburgh Opera is seeking a child to play the role of “Trouble” in our production of Madama Butterfly , to be performed at the Benedum Center in March 2025. This part is a simple but crucial role in the narrative of this wrenching story. Seeking an Asian, Pacific Islander identifying child, no gender preference (however, please note, they will be costumed as a male/boy-presenting character).  Though the story specifies a boy three years old, we expect to cast a child of five (5) or six (6) years, ideally small in stature. We are looking to cast two children. Specific performances TBD, but you must be available for all rehearsals and performances. We may choose one child, with a second one as an alternate in case of illness. If auditioning, you must be available for all scheduled calls (rehearsals and performances). The child appears in the latter half of the opera and is on stage at the very end. As such, some rehearsals and performances will end as late as 11pm. The tentative schedule is subject to change. We will also have additional times needed for costume fittings; typically, one to two sessions lasting 30-60 minutes. Auditions will be held on Wednesday, February 12 starting at 4:00pm and may involve basic theater games, following basic instructions and working with adult actors. There is no singing or speaking requirement. Sign up for an audition here! SUPERNUMERARY OPPORTUNITIES Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Opportunities Have you ever wanted to dance with Carmen, serve at the Café Momus, or simply be onstage at the Benedum Center? Apply to become a supernumerary! What is a Supernumerary? A Supernumerary—or “super”— is a non-singing, non-speaking role, much like an extra in film and television. Supers may perform as townspeople, guards, servants, and much more, providing silent but essential support to Pittsburgh Opera’s productions. Supers will share the stage with internationally renowned artists, work with celebrated directors and conductors, and experience the magic of opera from the Benedum Center stage. Stage experience is helpful but not required, and all super positions are filled on a voluntary basis. Individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities are welcome and encouraged to apply. Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary General Information Our larger productions will be presented at the Benedum Center in Downtown Pittsburgh. Staging rehearsals will take place at Pittsburgh Opera’s Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip District. Pittsburgh Opera’s Supernumeraries are enthusiastic and dependable. Supers are required to attend approximately 10-15 rehearsals, generally nights and weekends, as well as all performances. The occasional daytime rehearsal may be scheduled. Supers are paid a small honorarium of $100 and receive two (2) complimentary tickets, subject to availability. We are not able to offer housing or union credit for these roles. How do I apply? Follow the link below to complete an application. No phone calls please. Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Application Please complete the application and submit a recent full-body photo. Applicants will be added to the Pittsburgh Opera Database and will be contacted via email as opportunities become available.

VOICE TEACHER AMBASSADOR Pittsburgh Opera knows that the opera stars we love to see on stage would never be able to share the beauty and thrill of the operatic voice without the teachers that helped them along the way. We want to share our love for all voice teachers out there and connect with those who love opera singers as much as we do. Pittsburgh Opera’s Voice Teacher Ambassador program is a new initiative designed for teachers both locally and beyond to enjoy exclusive benefits, share their perspective, and help continue to spread the operatic joy that Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to bringing to the public. Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of. Whether you are a seasoned professor working in a university or run a dedicated private vocal studio, if you are enthusiastic about developing the voices of the world’s opera divas then we’d love to work with you. Voice Teacher Ambassadors will be asked to share Pittsburgh Opera’s digital season of free operatic performances with their students and, as we return to in-person live theater, encourage their students to visit our stages and experience our productions first hand (special student priced tickets are always available). Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your students. Please contact us via email to discuss. We look forward to hearing from you! As a Pittsburgh Opera Voice Teacher Ambassador, you’ll receive: Complimentary tickets to Opening Night of each of our Benedum Center productions Free admission to our Opera Up Close programs, which offer an in-depth look at the upcoming production with the artists that make them happen Complimentary access to select Master Classes throughout the season Access to complimentary “Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) in the Arts” workshops Virtual and In-Person Networking Participation in surveys and “think tanks” with other industry professionals Access to select educational resources 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

In April 2008, Pittsburgh Opera moved into its new home at 2425 Liberty Avenue in the Strip District. The building not only has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869 – but gives Pittsburgh Opera a bright future. In 2021, in grateful recognition of Francois Bitz 's exceptional generosity and long affiliation with the company, Pittsburgh Opera was proud to re-name its headquarters in the Strip District, the Bitz Opera Factory . At 45,000 square feet, the $8 million project features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes. Pittsburgh Opera’s building was designed by IKM . A new wrap-around metal, neon, and LEED sign was designed by Bill Kolano . Contractor is Massaro Corporation . The Bitz Opera Factory is the original home of the George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory. The air brake revolutionized railroad transportation. Guests enter the Bitz Opera Factory through this casual, welcoming lobby. The \"Garage\" Conference room has corrugated siding and a clear glass garage door entry. The George R. White Opera Studio is the home of many of our community events, including Brown Bag concerts. Our Five Founders are honored with a memorial plaque in our most-used public space. Our Wardrobe department stores everything from shoes to corsets to scarves to jewelry, and manufactures costumes when needed. The wig and makeup area, located within the Wardrobe department. The Library holds a treasure trove of books, scores, libretti, recordings, industry magazines, and more. Detail from the top of George Westinghouse's metal safe. Pittsburgh Opera is LEED Certified Silver in the Operations and Maintenance category. Pittsburgh Opera is LEED Certified Silver in the Operations and Maintenance category.

RENTAL GUIDELINES BUILDING Rental Rates Our current rental rates can be found on our website: https://www.pittsburghopera.org/facilities/hold-your-event-at-pittsburgh-opera/rental-information Load-in & Load-out Policy A full-day rental includes 12 hours from set-up to end of your event, plus one hour for clean-up. Access will be given to Social Tables for lessees to place objects around the space. Pittsburgh Opera event staff will set up the items as noted on Social Tables prior to lessee’s arrival. Lessees will inform Pittsburgh Opera staff of any rentals associated with their event. Drop off and pick up times must be coordinated prior to the event. Vendor drop offs are allowed the day prior to your event within the hours of 9:30am-1:30pm. Lessee will be charged an additional hourly fee for a ceremony rehearsal or drop off and set up of personal items, décor, etc. on the day prior to the event. It is preferred that all personal items must be removed from the building at the end of the event, however, if prior arrangements are made, items may be picked up at a later date. Rented items may be left and picked up on the next business day between 9:30am-1:30pm, with approval from Pittsburgh Opera. Additional Security The staffing fee for each event covers one (1) security guard, hired by PO, for the duration of your Event Time and one (1) PO staff member. Upper Level of GRW Access Guests may NOT access the upper level of the GRW. We will allow individuals up to the second level to put up and take down decorations. We will also allow photographer or videographer limited access the upper level. Restricted Items The following items are prohibited from use in the George Roland White Studio, Founders’ Room, and other associated spaces: Helium-filled balloons Confetti, glitter, beads, or similar loose items Feather boas Sparklers or other pyrotechnic instruments Gas/wood-fueled burners (Sternos are permitted) Hay or straw Unprotected taper candles Bubbles or foam machines Champagne towers or spraying of champagne indoors Smoking is not permitted on the Premises, including the garage area. Use of electronic cigarettes is also prohibited. Smoking shall only be permitted at designated areas outside of the garage area as defined by Pittsburgh Opera. In accordance with Pennsylvania State law, Lessee shall not permit the use of any illegal drugs in or about the Premises at any time. Guest Arrival There are two large Pittsburgh Opera signs on Liberty Avenue and two A-frame signs are placed at the entrance and exit of the parking garage. We do recommend that volunteers stand at the entrance and exit to the garage for your guests’ ease of mind. These volunteers can answer questions about parking or the event in general. VENDORS Preferred Vendors Pittsburgh Opera has no requirements about vendors, so you can feel free to use any caterer, DJ, photographer, etc. that best suits your budget and taste. A list of preferred Pittsburgh Opera vendors can be provided upon request. Kitchen Access Pittsburgh Opera has a small kitchen that the caterer may use for prep work. Because of poor ventilation, however, this is a warming kitchen and cannot accommodate cooking. If your menu requires on-site cooking, most caterers will set up a kitchen in the parking garage, where ventilation is not a factor. Alcohol Policy You are responsible for bringing in your own alcohol for the event, if desired. Many caterers will provide alcohol and bartenders for your event, at your request. Our only stipulation with the bar is that, due to PA liquor laws, you cannot sell alcohol on site, so the bar must be an open bar. Announcements & Music Pittsburgh Opera will not provide A/V equipment for your event. If you wish to have music or announcements made, it is recommended to hire a DJ. AMENITIES Ice Machine/Ice Storage Unfortunately, we do not have an ice machine. We do, however, have an ice chest located in the kitchen that can hold approximately 4-5 bags of ice. You will need to provide the ice. If you bring coolers with extra ice, they must be kept in the garage. Guest Parking Events have use of our parking garage on a first-come, first-served basis. While we will strive to ensure that at least some of your guests have use of this convenience, full use of the garage is not guaranteed. If our garage is full, other options include street parking (which is metered below 25 th Street), the $10 lot at the corner of Penn Avenue and 24 th Street (1 block from the Opera), and the $6 garage at the corner of Smallman Street and 24 th Street (2 blocks from the Opera). The lot across from the Opera on Liberty Avenue is a private lot and not available for rental. Many rental groups arrange for a shuttle service for their guests, though this is by no means required. Two of our preferred vendors – D & P Valet and The Hub – can also provide parking services. D & P Valet can be onsite to valet guests’ cars. The Hub will set up an account with the Lessee to allow guest’s parking fees to be billed to the Lessee directly. Pittsburgh Opera Tables and Chairs Providing our equipment isn’t being used for another event in the building, the Opera has the following: 1 10 25 6 5 10 2 5 350 72” round table (seats up to 10 people) 60” round tables (seats up to 8 people) 30” low round tables (seats up to 4 people) 26” high round tables 8’ x 24” rectangle tables 6’ x 24” rectangular utility tables 5’ bar units black leather chairs banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim) banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim) Piano Use Pittsburgh Opera usually keeps a grand piano in each room but they are removed if not being used.   If your group is interested in using a piano, a small piano tuning fee will be added to your final invoice. Pittsburgh Opera does NOT supply a pianist, so you will be required to hire one of your own. ADMINISTRATIVE Administrative Fees $150 insurance fee covers general liability for insurance for the space. If you wish to purchase more coverage or are looking for additional, generic event insurance, then you may purchase additional plans. $450 staffing fee covers a Pittsburgh Opera staff member to be on-site for the entirety of your rental from set-up to clean-up and a third-party security guard hired by Pittsburgh Opera. PO staff will ensure building systems are working throughout and stay clean during your event, along with basic support of PO equipment. $150 cleaning fee covers the additional cleaning of the event space, floors, , bathrooms, and kitchen. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

Ongoing Winners of the 2024 Inclusive Call for Art Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh, 1Hood Media, and the August Wilson African American Cultural Center again joined together to host the second iteration of Envisioning a Just Pittsburgh, an inclusive call for art that encouraged artists throughout southwestern Pennsylvania to share their visions for a just and equitable Pittsburgh. We are proud to announce the First and Second Place winners in the competition’s six categories. Through March 9 More than 80 ancient Egyptian objects Every Egyptian object in the museum’s care has stories to tell, about its creation and original use, its journey to Pittsburgh, and about the lives of those in ancient Egypt. The Stories We Keep invites visitors to see these objects—cared for by the Museum for more than a century—in a new light and to witness the work that will preserve them for future generations. Ongoing Sound Series Sound Series features a broad range of artists and bands from around the world that blur genres of contemporary independent music. The music performances take place in the museum’s intimate theater or silver-walled entrance space.

View our equity commitments View our Strategic Plan The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.

We thank you for your continued support and hope to answer some of your questions below. Why did you change the Café? Wasn’t it already perfect? The atmosphere is magical, and we are committed to keeping it so. But certain aspects of the Café’s pre-COVID business model didn't serve all of our visitors as well as they should. The adjustments we've made address some specific challenges: In the past, the Café served a small number of people very well, but the great majority of our visitors not at all. During our busiest months, from April to December, the Café was been fully booked at lunchtime days in advance. We routinely turned away two, three, and even four times as many people as we could seat. Without an opportunity for rest and refreshment, many visitors left the Frick before they could experience all we have to offer. By expanding our open hours, we hope to increase the number of visitors we can serve. From quick-and-easy delights to special-occasion indulgences, we are aiming to meet the needs of as many of our visitors as possible.

Pistachio Ice Cream? The Holiday Dinner Table: From Turkey to Latkes and... Pistachio Ice Cream? December 10, 2024 By: Lara Bromyard, Fall 2024 Learning & Visitor Experience Intern Celebrations are what continue to keep the nostalgia of holiday magic alive. From Christmas parties to Hannukah gift-giving and New Year’s festivities, there’s always an occasion to mark the busy holiday season. One thing that unites all these celebrations is sharing a meal amongst loved ones. A faux turkey on display in Clayton. The Frick Family celebrated Christmas, and the foods served during their holiday diners had varied inspirations all epitomizing the wealth of the Gilded Age. The Frick’s could afford expensive culinary delicacies like confectionary desserts, fresh seasonal produce, and delicately prepared meats. Such extravagance would undoubtedly be on display and served on a fine platter. Christmas dinner could feature a giant roasted turkey, certainly mouthwatering enough to satisfy everyone’s comfort-food cravings. Even the Frick’s version of a “kids” table would likely be adorned with holiday décor and fancy desserts such as pistachio ice cream and a Charlotte Russe cake, a decadent bread pudding served with sugared ladyfingers all around the side. The Frick’s were certainly fortunate to enjoy such lavish dinners and desserts for their Christmas dinners, but not everyone could afford the same extravagant foods. What remained the same for families holding a holiday feast, regardless of what was served, was more so about the act itself: “But in fact, meals along the entire spectrum of means in nineteenth-century America were linked by a common concern with ritual, formality, and schedule.” 1 Such words harken images of deep Christmas traditions that families like the Frick’s celebrated. If you’re looking to catch a glimpse into classic Gilded Age Christmas traditions, I won’t spoil the fun, and instead encourage you to tour Clayton house for its “ Home for the Holidays ” tour! A children's table arrangement from the Ladies Home Journal. In it, you can see the \"snowball\" shaped ice cream on each plate. There are so many ways that holiday traditions in the Gilded Age have shaped our modern understanding of celebrations. One of the biggest influences was the large influx of immigrants who came to the United States between 1871 and 1901, totaling over 11 million people. These immigrants brought over traditional foods and recipes from their homelands to the United States, excited to celebrate the holiday season in their new homes. 2 Parties, family gatherings, and small gift-giving became more common during the late 19th century. 3 Immigration also brought on new traditions in holiday meals. Sometimes, this was done by adding their own twist to the original meals from their homelands, such as the feast of the seven fishes. 4 Originating in Southern Italy, this fish feast is popular amongst Italian Americans, of which there is a significant population in Pittsburgh. Enjoying the traditional foods of ancestral homes is a way to bring together family and celebrate your shared heritage. A faux scoop of pistachio ice cream on display in Clayton's dining room. There are countless regional differences in the food served over the holidays in the U.S. For those celebrating Hannukah, you can expect to see scrumptious fried potato cakes called latkes to mark the holiday. These savory fried potatoes are a favorite Hannukah dish that dates back centuries. 5 In the southern region of the U.S. near the Gulf Coast, you may come across a steaming hot pot of gumbo. The rich broth and spices depend on the region, but you can expect the aroma of bay leaves, filé, okra, and perhaps turkey and ham swapped for the crabs and shrimp. 6 Meanwhile, near the southwest corner of the country, tamales grace the dinner table and are typically served in a corn husk and filled with meats, cheeses, or veggies. 7 A faux Charlotte Russe cake on display in the center of Clayton's dining room table. When thinking about all these different and delicious foods, it is important to remember those who are behind the preparation of holiday meals. Great effort is put into cooking large dinners, whether it’s the beloved patriarch or matriarch or families contributing and working together, the efforts and contributions that go into making and preparing food deserve its due appreciation. The Frick family employed a large staff, especially during the holidays. Workers like Mary Coyne, Bridgit Conroy, and Spencer Ford would probably have worked through Christmas and other holidays to ensure that the family and their guests’ dinner was prepared and served. Whether you’re having a family meal prepared by your grandmother or getting a meal catered, be sure to show gratitude for the work and care put into making your holiday meal. And whatever the holiday meal you choose to enjoy, remember that it is special because of your own unique traditions. So, grab a mug of mulled wine, a steaming hot cup of cocoa, or a classic eggnog and settle in for another year marking the festivities of the holiday you celebrate. Enjoy cooking your family’s beloved traditional holiday dish, or maybe try something new—just remember to savor every bite!

Spencer was born in Virginia on October 15, 1864. Though the existing payroll records for Clayton only start in 1892, we know that Spencer was living in Pittsburgh as early as 1888, when he married his wife, Hattie. Hattie was also from Virginia, and at the time of their marriage, they were living in Pittsburgh’s 21st Ward.  In 1899 he was shown as living on Aurelia Street in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Spencer never lived in Clayton itself, but it was likely that he lived close to the home since he was there every day, probably early in the morning and late at night. The 21st Ward stretched from the Allegheny River to the Liberty neighborhood which butted up to the property that the Frick’s owned. Spencer Ford stands outside Clayton during a snowstorm. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. Clayton was often a busy home that served multiple purposes. The Fricks were hosting family and friends along with business partners and politicians. As the household chef, Spencer was an integral part of a successful visit to the home. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Clayton for a luncheon. While this luncheon was catered by Hotel Schenley, others like it took place on a regular basis. Events of this size would have been hosted around the holidays or for important business meetings. To create these experiences, Spencer would have worked closely with Adelaide Frick to curate this menu and would have created it with the help of other household staff, like Mary Coyne and Nellie Lupton. The menu of the luncheon catered by Hotel Schenley for President Theodore Roosevelt's visit. Spencer would have cooked meals similar to this regularly. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. While Spencer was used to cooking for large groups and important occasions, daily life at Clayton also asked a lot of the chef. He was expected to prepare six meals per day: three meals for the Frick family and three for the staff living and working in the home. In addition to providing these courses for everyone living in the home, Spencer was also tasked with organizing grocery buying and preparation. During his time working for the family, he developed a relationship with them, especially with Childs Frick, who he exchanged correspondence with when he was away at boarding school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For upper class families, dining was an important and well-orchestrated event: “The hour of dinner has been pronounced … to be, in civilized life, the most important hour of the twenty-four.” For fancier meals and events, it was typical to have up to eight distinct courses. Creating and preparing for these occasions was an extensive task for Spencer. Cooking a consommé could take up to five hours depending on the recipe, plus Spencer would have had to pickle any of the food like radishes that would have been eaten between courses. In addition, menus often included several complicated meat dishes that each include sides. Luncheons like this one also included multiple desserts. For example, anytime ice cream was on the menu it was likely made fresh in the kitchen. Hand-churning ice cream for large groups of people would have been extremely time consuming and physically rigorous.  Prep for some of these events would have started days, if not weeks, beforehand, all while preparing the daily meals for staff and family. Spencer Ford sitting in the kitchen of Clayton, next to the stove. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. Even though Spencer worked for the Fricks for many years, his salary changed very little over that spread of time. In 1892 his wages were $35 (approximately $1,200 today) per month, rising in 1894 to $40 (approximately $1,300 today) per month. This $40 remained consistent for the remainder of the time that he worked for the family until 1909. Comparatively, Ford made more than any of the women who worked in the house but only about half of what the men on the grounds crew, like David Fraser, or the coachman, James Elmore, were making, both of whom were white men. In comparison, when the Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, they paid their new French chef $150 a month. During Spencer’s tenure with the family, payroll records and personal correspondence between Henry Frick’s assistant, F.W. McElroy, and Spencer  indicate that he consistently requested advances on his paychecks, usually for at least half of his pay. These requests became more common in the early 20th century when Spencer had been making the same salary for over a decade. Spencer Ford stands outside the back door of Clayton. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. Spencer did not move with the family to New York in 1905, instead remaining to work in Clayton until late 1909. The Fricks returned to visit Clayton often and the house remained staffed even when the family was not in Pittsburgh, so Spencer would have continued his daily tasks of meal preparation during those years. The 1920 census shows Spencer and his wife Hattie living in Washington, DC, where he continued his work as a chef at a hotel. He passed away shortly after in 1921.

During the Gilded Age, this was particularly true because of the commerce that literally flowed through these bodies of water. While industrialists like Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie utilized these rivers for their steel mills, there was another figure in Pittsburgh who made his living on the water. Cumberland Posey was an African American businessman who found substantial success with his steamboat business and later investments in and around Homestead, PA. Cumberland Posey (left), and his wife Anna Posey (right). Photos courtesy of Pennsylvania Negro Business DIstrict, 1910. Cumberland Posey was born in 1858 to Mary Elizabeth Fontaine and Alexander Posey, an enslaved family in Maryland. His mother passed away early in his life, and after Emancipation during the Civil War, his father became a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The family later moved to Virginia and then to Ohio, where Cumberland started working on boats, a common occupation for African American men who lived in river towns. Some accounts have him working first by sweeping the decks, whereas others report his job as a fireman. At this point, Mr. Posey set his sights on becoming an engineer, a rarity for African American men, who were generally hired for more menial and laborious occupations in the 19th century.  To reach his goal and acquire the knowledge needed to pursue it, he continued to work jobs on various steamboats, slowly gaining the experience and connections he needed. This process was made even more difficult because of the heavy discrimination he encountered.  Yet, his hard work and planning paid off:  he acquired his license as a second engineer in 1877, becoming the first Black man in America to do so. Posey’s reputation followed the flow of the Ohio River, and soon he was known as Captain “Cap” Posey. While traveling along the river, he met his future wife, Anna Stevens, in Athens, Ohio. They were married in 1883 and stayed in Ohio until they ultimately moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Homestead, a city on the rise due to the steel industry. The home of Cumberland Posey in Homestead, PA. Photo courtesy of Pennsylvania Negro Business Directory, 1910. The move to Pennsylvania was extremely fortuitous for his business ventures. Soon after getting his engineering license, he started amassing wealth in different industries. He founded the Posey Steamboat Company, which built over 40 steamboats, and the Delta Coal Company. Both of his companies were highly successful. Posey was also one of the founding members of the Posey and Myers coal merchants’ organization. In addition to his companies, he became one of the largest individual property holders in Homestead as part of a real estate venture. However, in 1897, Posey became embroiled in controversy. In June of that year, he and his business partner were arrested for defrauding the Shoenberger Steel Company by selling them a lower-quality coal than they were paying for. The two were released on bail for $3,000 and were eventually found guilty. Because of Mr. Posey’s success in these industries, he encountered the other industrialists of this time, including Henry Clay Frick. After the Homestead Lockout in 1892, Carnegie and Frick refused to rehire most of the workers who had gone on strike. Posey helped recruit new Black workers and presented the Carnegie businesses as a friendly face to the growing Black community. One of Cumberland Posey's notable boats, the Cyclone. Photo courtesy of the Cincinnati Public Library's Inland Rivers collection. Cumberland Posey’s legacy extends far beyond the wealth he built as a businessman. He was also actively involved in many other organizations. He notably became one of the first investors in the Pittsburgh Courier, once the country’s most widely circulated Black newspaper. He was also on the Board of Directors for the Warren ME Church in the Hill District and served as president of the Loendi Club, one of Pittsburgh's oldest literary clubs. At the time of his death in 1925, he was considered “one of the richest men in the city.” He was survived by two sons and one daughter and was buried with full Masonic honors in Homestead Cemetery. Cumberland Posey's son, Cum Posey, Jr. (pictured front row, second from left), played on and managed the Homestead Grays throughout the early 20th century. Photo courtesy of Historic Pittsburgh. The Posey family remained influential in Pittsburgh even after Cap’s death – his son Cumberland Posey Jr. was the principal owner of the Homestead Grays, one of the preeminent clubs in the Negro League.

A Gilded Age house was only as good as the staff that supported it, and luckily for the Frick household, they had a reliable support system in Jane Grandison, the family nurse and confidante. During the Gilded Age, nursing as a profession was a very intimate career. Nurses like Mrs. Grandison worked closely with a handful of families to help them with long-term childcare on top of any medical expertise they also provided. Because of this it was common for nurses and the families they worked for to develop strong relationships. In the case of the Fricks, Jane was a trusted employee and partner during some of the most difficult periods of their lives. Jane Grandison pictured with Martha and Childs Frick. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. Much of Jane’s early years are unknown, but she, like many other African Americans, may have migrated to Pittsburgh to seek better opportunities. Born in 1833 in Arkansas, she married Jeremiah “Jerry” Grandison, a native of Washington D.C. The 1880 Pittsburgh census lists Jane Grandison as living in the Hill District neighborhood on Logan Street with Jerry and their two children, Ida and William. Jane and her family were well-known residents of the Hill District. Her husband Jerry made history in 1878 when Mayor Robert Liddell chose him and two other Black men, Dorsey Jones and Scott Taper, to serve as police officers for the very first time. Throughout the 1880s, Jane worked as a professional nurse and wealthy families in Pittsburgh, which included the Fricks, frequently employed her. It’s probable that in 1889 she accompanied the Frick family on their vacation in Europe. On this trip, she would have helped to care for the very young Helen Frick. During the summer of 1891, Jane was traveling in Cresson Springs in Cambria County Pennsylvania, to assist the Dalzell family; John Dalzell was a congressman who represented Pittsburgh in the House of Representatives and served for 13 consecutive terms. John and his wife, Mary Duff, had five children and were a well-known family in the city. The Fricks were at the resort as well, attempting to improve the health of their oldest daughter, Martha. A close friend and employee of the Frick’s, Annie Blumenschine Stephany, recalls Jane inquiring about the health of Martha during that same summer. After Martha tragically passed away in August of 1891, Mrs. Grandison was hired by the Fricks once again in 1892. Jane Grandison (far right) pictured with unknown children at an unknown location. Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. In addition to caring for Helen, Jane attended to Adelaide Frick either during or directly after the birth of her fourth child, Henry Clay Frick Jr. Henry’s birth was an extremely difficult labor and delivery process for both the mother and child. Jane helped care for Henry Jr. for the entirety of his life, which only lasted for several weeks. After Henry Clay Frick Jr. passed away, the family took post-mortem photographs of the infant, which was common at the time. These photos include Jane Grandison holding the baby on her lap. Her employment by the Frick family during this summer is even more notable because of the tumultuous nature of the time period. During the same summer in 1892, Henry Frick hired 300 Pinkertons, a private police agency, to break a strike in one of his steel mills, resulting in the death of 10 people. Directly afterward, there was an assassination attempt on Henry’s life by Alexander Berkman, an avowed anarchist. Because of the care that she showed his family, Jane was the only person that Henry Frick trusted to cook for him after that incident. Jane’s role at Clayton during and after the summer of 1892 speaks volumes to the intimate relationship between a nurse and her employer, as she was present for an extremely difficult period in the Fricks’ lives—she likely knew them at their most vulnerable. Content warning : Post-mortem photography was common during the Gilded Age and often seen as part of the grieving ritual. Jane Grandison was photographed with Henry Clay Frick, Jr. after his death. You can access the image here . Photo courtesy of the Frick Art Reference Library. Jane Grandison’s impact on the city extends far beyond the walls of Clayton and other homes of Pittsburgh’s upper class. One of her greatest legacies was the creation of the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women alongside Mary Bond Peck, whose brother David Jones Peck was the first African American to graduate from Rush Medical School in Chicago, IL in 1847. The home, established as a place of refuge for those who needed assistance, opened in 1883, initially in the Hill District. According to the Pittsburgh Press , “When the work was started there was no capital other than woman’s indomitable will at the back of the project, and it was by perseverance and patience that success was achieved.” The institution hosted tens of women at a time. One of the first women to stay was “Aunt Peggy,” who was well over 100 years old at the time of her registration at the Home. Mrs. Grandison served as the president of the Home for a time and, during her administration, two new pieces of property were purchased by the institution. She also secured the first state funding for the Home and some of the largest donations in the institution's history. The Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women moved to the Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar neighborhood and later became known as the Lemington Home. These organizations served the residents of the neighborhood for over 120 years until 2005, when it ultimately closed. In addition to her work with these vital organizations, Jane also served on the Board of Managers of the Lincoln Memorial Cemetery Association and was a member of Trinity AME Church. At the time of Jane Grandison’s passing in 1896, she was a highly respected resident of the Pittsburgh community. At the end of her life, her estate totaled $1,950 (approximately $70,000 today), which was distributed amongst her children and grandchildren. She is buried in Homewood Cemetery. Her funerary announcement reads: “Her family lost a loving parent, the community a praiseworthy citizen, the association an earnest, conscientious official, and the board of managers an associate whose demise is deeply deplored and whose absence will be felt in many ways for a long period.” Today, Jane Grandison is remembered for her life of service, both to the families she worked for and to her community.

For some, it was a glittering dream; one in which those with the know-how and penchant for hard work could climb the proverbial ladder to success. Carnegie, Frick, Gould, Rockefeller, and other industrial-minded men dominated the visage of the period, living lives surrounded by extraordinary wealth and boundless power. The immortality of their legacies is recognized in the names of buildings, libraries, streets, and boroughs. We know these men. Yet there were many others left out of stories of the Age: unsung individuals who worked and made a difference through their skills in sometimes quieter ways, still exemplifying the spirit of industry, philanthropy, and service to their communities. These individuals left their marks on the city in indelible ways, from establishing their own businesses when the doors of others were closed to them, participating in charitable activities, running for political office, and taking their earnings back to the African American neighborhoods and organizations, and funding schools and homes for the caretaking of the most vulnerable. There are no buildings or monuments to them. Still, their commitment to improving conditions for thousands of African Americans who came to the City of Pittsburgh in the late 19th through early 20th century lives on in the community building organizers, entrepreneurs, restauranteurs, and educators in the city today. While there are many stories yet to be told about the Black men and women of Pittsburgh’s Gilded Age, this series will introduce you to three dynamic individuals who shaped the landscape and led lives of service: Jane Grandison, Cumberland Posey, Sr., and Spencer Ford. We invite you to learn about them not just as part of Black history but also as part of the history that makes Pittsburgh great. Our Story You May Also Like...

Take a peek! If you've been to the Frick lately, you've seen that we're making improvements to the Car and Carriage Museum. You might have peeked through one of the portholes to see cars being moved or interior scaffold being errected. The Car and Carriage Museum collection is being kept safe and sound while we make important and necessary repairs to the museum roof. These essential repairs will ensure that our permanent collection is preserved for generations to come and will allow us to get the galleries in tip-top shape for Black Mobility: Autonomy and the Automobile in Pittsburgh 1916–1955 (May 13, 2023–February 4, 2024). If you are interested in learning more or would like to make a donation to support these improvements or the Black Mobility exhibition, please email Maddy Rolla or call her at 412-342-4098. On September 6, 2022, the Car and Carriage Museum will close for approximately six months. During that time, the entire collection of cars and carriages will be placed in storage. Only the Community Room (the function space on the north side of the Car and Carriage Museum building) and accessible restrooms will be open. The nearby Education Center will remain open as usual. The closure will accommodate much-needed repairs to the roof and ceiling. Preventing future water incursion will help to preserve the collection for all. When the museum reopens in March 2023, it will have a watertight slate roof, additional insulation to enhance the building’s energy efficiency, and a freshly repainted interior. Watch our website for updates about the next exhibition in the Car and Carriage Museum, Black Mobility: Autonomy and the Automobile in Pittsburgh 1916–1955 (May 13, 2023–February 4, 2024). Black Mobility will not only be the first exhibition in the refurbished galleries, it will also be the first-ever Car and Carriage Museum exhibition to be accompanied by a catalogue. The Frick has embarked on a series of construction projects, including these important improvements to the Car and Carriage Museum. Together, they will improve accessibility to our site, preserve our collections for future generations, and enhance the beauty and safety of our garden campus. Curious to learn more?

This week, a look at two true outdoor girls. Mary Anning \"The extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong.\" - Lady Harriet Silvester on Mary Anning, 1824 Mary Anning was one of ten children, but only she and an older brother lived to adulthood. Anning’s survival was an especially remarkable feat given when she was fifteen months old a woman holding her was killed instantly when the tree they were standing under was struck by lightning. Without a formal education, Anning used her innate skills to literally carve a profession out of the bedrock in the emerging science of paleontology—the study of life forms from extinct geologic periods. Mary Anning and her dog Tray in Lyme Regis, England, painted by an unknown artist before 1842. In 1812, Anning gained notoriety after excavating her first ichthyosaur (a four-finned reptile) along the steep cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. In 1828, she found a flying pterodactyl. The scientific community had never before seen these fossil types. Every morning Anning clambered over miles of shorelines in hopes that storm waves uncovered salvageable remains. Her successful discoveries garnered much needed revenue; the most complete fossils were acquired by natural history museums in England, France, and the United States. A rare tribute was bestowed upon her in 1846, when she became an Honorary Member of the Geological Society of London—an organization that did not officially allow female membership. Less than a year later, Anning died of breast cancer at the top of her career and proud of her accomplishments. \"I am well known throughout the whole of Europe,\" she said. Marianne North Marianne North, photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron in Sri Lanka, 1877. Marianne North spent an idyllic childhood drawing, singing, and riding horses. Her father, Frederick North, a Liberal Member of Parliament, delighted in taking his young daughter to the Botanic Gardens at Kew and to the Horticultural Society’s Gardens at Chiswick. North’s interest in botany grew in part because of access to her father’s three greenhouses: one for orchids, another for temperate plants, and a third for vines and cuttings. She tended the vegetation and documented its various structures. On her father’s passing in 1869, she inherited a substantial estate, which funded her explorations around the world. Marianne North painting a boy in Ceylon, 1877. From 1871 to 1885, North—who never married—visited sixteen countries on five continents. Indefatigable, she sought new vegetal specimens to paint at each destination. North reminisced about one trip to Brazil in 1872: \"My dress was as good as any could be for such riding, namely, a short linsey petticoat and a long woolen waterproof cloak with sleeves. I had besides a light silk waterproof rolled up and hung on my pommel for extra wet hours, and my old black straw hat on my head.\" In 1879, Marianne offered 627 botanical oil paintings to Kew Gardens, along with funds to construct a gallery. The Marianne North Gallery opened on June 7, 1882, and was extended the following year to accommodate additional donations that would eventually total 848 artworks. This legacy of extensive travels also formed an important educational opportunity for the public, most of whom would never venture outside Great Britain to see such plants in their native habitats.

The winning champion of each event relished their victory with $500 in grand prize money, a life-like pickle trophy, and—most importantly—a “royal” title fitting of their pickle prowess. Congrats to our 2024 Champions! Pickle Juice Drinking Quench your thirst for brine in this test of speed and fermented fortitude. Whoever can chug a quart (32 fl oz.) of Pittsburgh Pickle Company’s Picklexir the fastest will be deemed the winner of their round and vie for the title of Duke of Drinking in the championship on Sunday. Pickle Eating – New! Only stomachs of steel will prevail in this new contest category! Whoever eats the most pickles by weight in five minutes (‘chipmunking’ is allowed) will win their round and earn a spot in the final, where the Earl of Eating , first of their name, will be crowned. Bobbing for Pickles – New! No hands are allowed in this pickled take on the peculiar party pastime. Whoever can retrieve the most pickles by weight in 90 seconds using only their mouth will win the round and face-off in the finals to become Picklesburgh’s first Baron of Bobbing ! General Contest Rules & Regulations All contestants must be 18 years of age or older. All contestants will initially be selected through the pre-registration process. Contestants may complete only one registration form per event – duplicate entries in the same event will not be counted. All contestants must complete a waiver of liability and publicity release on-site the day of the contest. Contestants may only compete in one preliminary round of each game. Contestants will receive an email confirming their assigned round time and further details. Assigned competition slots are non-transferrable. If you can no longer participate, please let us know. There will be preliminary rounds held each day of the event and a final championship round held on the final day of the event. The winners of each preliminary round will be required to return to the festival to compete in the championship round on Sunday, July 21. Contestants must arrive at the assigned check-in area (included in their acceptance email) no later than 30 minutes prior to their assigned competition round or they forfeit their time slot. Any forfeited/open slots will be randomly assigned to on-site walk-ups, which are open to any eligible adult. The raffle for any open/forfeited slots will occur 15 minutes prior to each round. Interested contestants must be present during the raffle to be eligible for that round. Raffle drawings and assignments are final and up to the judges’ discretion. Contestants who lose their assigned or raffled round may enter the walk-up raffle to compete again, but they are not guaranteed any additional competition rounds. Organizers reserve the right to assign, reserve, remove, and reschedule competition slots as well as cancel anyone’s individual participation in any round. These decisions are non-negotiable and final. Any unsportsmanlike conduct is grounds for immediate disqualification and removal from the contest at the discretion of the contest judges. The winner will be determined by judges appointed by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. The judges’ decisions are final and non-contestable. Rules, eligibility, times, and prizes are subject to change without notice at the discretion of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.

Most locations accept reservations during restaurant week to streamline their customer service. For restaurants that do not offer online reservations, call to inquire about a dining time. MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK. When being seated and offered menus, ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing. GRATUITIES APPRECIATED. Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte.

Started in 2012, it’s been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses of celebrating “New Dishes for the New Year” while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare. What’s Required? In order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below. Get Listed: Complete The Online Registration Process Restaurant registration is accepted on a rolling basis up until the celebration. A restaurant must complete the online registration form and submit timely payment to appear on the listing of restaurants and on the participating restaurant map. The registration form will ask for the anticipated pricing structure (multi-course vs special entrees, but the exact pricing structure is NOT locked in until menu is provided. On the restaurant listing page, the restaurant appears at the bottom of the page until the menu is received. Get Promoted: Submit Menu For Advertising Once the limited-time menu has been determined, upload the special menu through the website to receive the full benefit of the celebration. It is recommended the menu is provided as text-only and not embedded in a prepared graphic. Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant’s profile. Menus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s social media platforms. Menus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created. More On Pricing With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include: Fixed-price 3-course meal for $20.24-45.24. This variable price point allows restaurants to price their menus’ accordingly. Menu items do not have to come from the restaurant’s regular menu, but should be representative of the restaurant’s style of cooking. As an example, restaurants whose normal ﬁxed price menu is above $35, create a special menu for Restaurant Week for $35.24. $20.24 Specialty Items in honor of Restaurant Week 2024. This could be a specialty entrée, appetizer-entrée combination or even stretched to “Dinner for Two” depending on the pricing structure that best fits the restaurant.

Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split,  “Ice-Cream Joe” Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler Inside Strickler’s Drug Store Outside Strickler’s Drug Store Photos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society Honorary Chair Ice Cream Joe Gruble The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair. Stay up to date on the latest information.

Time left to complete order Announcing the release of our first Lullaby Project album! Written and sung by Lullaby Project participants. LISTEN TO THE ALBUM About the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Lullaby Project The Lullaby Project, a project of Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute, pairs new and expecting parents and caregivers with professional artists to write and sing personal lullabies for their babies. The participants are offered a creative opportunity to communicate feelings, hopes, and dreams as they look to the future with their child. The Lullaby Project supports maternal health, aids childhood development, and strengthens the bond between parent and child. With its launch in 2024, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will host two cohorts of the program, serving ten families in each. The first Project cohort began in early 2024 and concluded with a community Celebration Concert on June 24, 2024, at the Trust’s Greer Cabaret Theater. The second cohort of the program will be coordinated with new participating families during the fall 2024 and a Celebration Concert will be held in early 2025. This was like a therapy session with music and words. I’m glad I tried it. [The song is] a memory you can create for you and your child. - Lullaby Project Participant Our Teaching Artists Photo credit: Seth Culp-Ressler. Lullaby Teaching Artists Sean Baker, Lynn Speakman, and David Bowens.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both? Containing some of Haydn’s most inspired music, not only is Armida Haydn’s most highly regarded opera, but the composer himself referred to it as his best work. These will be Pittsburgh Opera's first performances of Armida . Pittsburgh Opera will mount a new production.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. Act 1 Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed by news that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. He offers his kingdom and Armida’s hand in marriage to the Christian knight Rinaldo if he agrees to fight against his fellow Christians. Enchanted and obsessed with Armida, Rinaldo vows to betray his men and his faith. Meanwhile, Armida, tormented by her passionate love for Rinaldo, pleads with the gods for his safety. Scene 2: A mountainside. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarca plan to rescue Rinaldo from Armida’s enchantment. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians. However, upon encountering Clotarca, Zelmira falls in love with her, despite her better judgment, and offers to lead her to safety. Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of Idreno’s approaching forces. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo about Armida’s charms and chastises him for abandoning his Christian duty. Though remorseful, Rinaldo remains unable to break free from Armida’s enchantment. Act 2 Scene 1: Back in the council chamber. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarca's demand that the Christian knight enchanted by Armida be freed. Though the spell is broken, Rinaldo reluctantly leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury. Scene 2: Back at the mountainside. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo back as he prepares to rejoin the crusaders in battle. Armida arrives, pleading for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo, torn but resolute, departs for battle with Ubaldo, leaving Armida betrayed and alone. Act 3 Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, aware that the myrtle tree holds the secret to Armida’s powers, enters the grove to destroy it. Zelmira and a group of nymphs appear, attempting to persuade him to return to Armida. As Rinaldo raises his weapon to strike the myrtle, a disheveled Armida emerges from the tree and confronts him. Unable to kill Rinaldo despite her fury, she watches as he strikes the tree, causing the magic wood to fall lifeless. As Rinaldo tries to escape, he declares to still love her. Armida, consumed by fury, turns into a monster of rage, destroying all in her path.

In this groundbreaking new production created by an all Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect. Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real. Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera , Detroit Opera , and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy. These performances are sponsored in part by generous gifts from Caroline & Mary Barensfeld, Daniel G. & Carole L. Kamin, Glenmede, and The Galliot Fund.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings. This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon ( Cold Mountain ) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother?

Would she die for love?

Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all. Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”). ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death. - Adapted from Opera News DETAILS AND RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza. Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed. PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people. ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking. ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

By participating in the program, you would receive a substantial tax credit and impact the community through your support of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. How does EITC impact our youth? EITC gifts help our museums provide innovative, informal education programming in the arts and sciences to as many as 10,000 public school students through virtual and in-person programs such as: The Art Connection at Carnegie Museum of Art is Pittsburgh’s premiere art program for students in grades 5-9. Students learn drawing, printmaking, painting, sculpting, and mixed media—culminating with a student exhibition. SciTech at Carnegie Science Center is a special field trip that features the industry growth areas of Pittsburgh, ranging from biotech to robotics and advanced materials/processes. It connects middle and high school students with leading STEM innovators in a fun, dynamic atmosphere as they explore interactive exhibits from leading STEM companies and organizations. Museum on the Move at Carnegie Museum of Natural History connects children and youth to the museum’s programs and collections through partnerships with local hospitals, special needs classrooms, homeless shelters, and community-based organizations. Youth Invasion at The Andy Warhol Museum is an annual spring celebration planned by members of the museum’s Youth Arts Council—a year-long leadership program for high school students. The event features local young performers and a themed exhibition of works by teen artists. How does the tax credit work? The Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program, administered by Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), encourages strategic philanthropy by allowing companies to distribute their tax dollars to organizations like Carnegie Museums that support the important work of our schools through creative programming. Thanks to the EITC program a one-year commitment to an education program at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh can earn your company a tax credit of 75% of the contribution. The tax credit can be increased to 90% of the contribution if your company agrees to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years. Getting started is easy! To start the application process, visit CarnegieMuseums.org/EITC for EITC guidelines and access to the PA DCED’s electronic single application system. Once you apply and are approved, make your contribution to Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh within 60 days. To learn more about qualifying Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh educational programming and how EITC can work to your company’s advantage, contact a member of our team at 412.622.5771 or email corporategiving@carnegiemuseums.org .

It has been a real pleasure to work with you throughout our planning, and your staff was very helpful last week. Everyone was unbelievably pleasant, and our guests were impressed with the venue and the service. It was nice to relax and enjoy the evening knowing that we were in great hands. Adding on the Founders Room at the last minute proved to be a good decision, and I appreciate everyone who also made that a good experience. Thank you again for being such a valuable resource; you really helped us have a positive experience. Adria Banko – 7/16/22 Dear All, We don’t know how to begin to thank you for Colleen & Eric’s Wedding day.  Everything and every detail was perfect!!  The room looked spectacular and the food was amazing (as well as the amazing wedding cake, which got rave reviews)!!  You all did a fantastic job and Trish & I are very grateful! Colleen & Eric could not have been happier the way things turned out and that’s what really matters.  Again, Trish and I thank you for everything you did for us and the newlyweds, we really appreciate it!! Kevin & Trish –  6/18/2022 Hello Vanessa, Now that the craziness of our wedding day is over and our emotions have settled, I would like to thank you for your help in making our wedding possible.  Your efforts to help get us acclimated to the venue, answer all of our questions, and address all of our concerns over the past year have been exceptional. The venue was absolutely spectacular and directly matched the vision that my wife (still getting used to saying and writing that identifier!) and I sought to witness and present to our guests.  Everything from the spacious layout of the tables and chairs to the presentation of the glassware at each table to the depiction of the cookie table was done to perfection!  You helped realize our dream, and for that we are incredibly thankful! We would not have known that you were newer to the “Events Manager” role if you had not told us.  You did a fabulous job of presenting the information and details to us at the pertinent times and made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process.  We cannot keep track of how many people thoroughly enjoyed our wedding, with many of them saying it was the best wedding that they had ever attended!  We could not have reaped this praise without your guidance and leadership. Thank you for making the day a memory for life for my wife and me.  We still feel beyond excited every time we realize we had our wedding reception at the Science Center!  Without you, this would have not been possible! I am currently recommending PointView Hall as a venue to some of my newly engaged friends who are looking to host their wedding.  Your name is also being linked to this recommendation, as we feel very confident that you will provide the same quality of service to them as you did to us. I will be sure to contact you in the future should there be another event I would be interested in hosting. Thank you very much! Chandler McGovern-Johnson Wedding  – 5/14/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for all of your hard work in making our wedding day perfect! We so enjoyed working with you and the entire Carnegie museums team for our reception. We absolutely loved how the space turned out and have heard endless compliments on the food. Thank you again for making our day so special. Sydney Dombrowski  – 4/23/22 Dallas, Cassie, and Lindsay, Thank you all so much for making our wedding unforgettable. Our guests were blown away by the hospitality, food, and space (hats off to Mr. Carnegie, he had wonderful taste in décor). Our night would not have functioned as well as it did if it weren’t for you ladies and your team. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We truly appreciate everything you did. Much love, The Grubers  – 4/23/2022 Good evening! I just wanted to send a big thank you to you and your team at the science center. I got my wedding gallery back today and everything was an absolute dream. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my day so special. All of our guests could not stop raving about the cocktail hour, food, the ballroom, and view. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Jayne and Conner Phillips   – 4/2/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for everything you have done these past few years. You made what could have been a stressful experience moving a wedding four times not very stressful at all. We appreciate you more than you know, and it has been an absolute pleasure working with you. So happy to finally be able to celebrate! Josh and Taylor Davis  – 1/16/2022 Bridgitte, Holy crap!!! Thank you so much for everything! Our wedding was absolutely amazing! Everything was perfect! You are such a freaking Rockstar! You have such a wonderful team and we cannot thank you enough. Thank you for being diligent, kind, and prompt. You took wedding planning and it fun and stress free. Thank you so much!   We are forever grateful for you, your team and The Warhol Catherine and Jessica  – 12/11/2021 A Night to Remember While looking for a venue, my now husband and I wanted somewhere close to downtown with beautiful views, and paired well with our nerdy side. After visiting the Science Center for a tour of the space we knew immediately this was where we wanted our reception to be held. The entire staff and team we coordinated with was so professional, helpful and easy to work with that we fully were able to enjoy the entire evening! The ability to have catering included was a huge bonus for us, as well and not needing to looking into bartenders and other staff. We had such a wonderful night and highly recommend checking out Point View Hall for a larger space! Caitrin F.  – 11/13/2021 Dear Dallas, Cassie, & Trista Thank you all so much for helping us organize our wedding on October 23. We felt you all did an exceptional job, we can’t thank you enough for helping to calm our nerves with your excellent attention to detail. If there’s anything we can do in the future (customer reviews, recommendations, etc.) please let us know! All our very best wishes, Sarah and Oliver – 10/23/2021 Dear Dallas, We don’t have the words to thank you enough for all that you did for us. Our wedding was 100% a fairy tale…literally the best night of our lives! You kept us calm during the whole process of planning a pandemic wedding and you’re just so damned nice!  The museum is truly lucky to have you and we are so happy we had our wedding there. Trista and Lenny Weiss – 6/26/2021 “Thank you so much for making my daughter’s wedding such a memorable event. It was hard enough to be dealing with Covid-19 without the added stress of a wedding but you were amazing! You went above and beyond the call of duty from zooming the entire event so our friends and family could see it to helping our photographer and working with the music. The Carnegie Museum is such a fabulous place to have a wedding and I think it’s an underused resource in Pittsburgh. Being wed under the T-Rex is just an amazing setting. This was my daughter’s dream wedding for years and you made it possible.” 10/1/2020 FAQs What all is included in the rental fee?

Face Time Hope Gillespie There’s a movie poster of Harrison Ford’s iconic character Indiana Jones fixed to Hope Gillespie’s office wall at Carnegie Science Center. It is there for professional inspiration as much as workplace decor. “I cannot overstate the influence Indiana Jones has had on my life,” says Gillespie, who is the museum experiences officer at the Science Center. The film franchise piqued her interest in archaeology—she holds a bachelor’s degree in archaeology from The George Washington University and a master’s degree in the discipline from University College London. But she also just loves the character’s catchphrase about artifacts—“It belongs in a museum”—that informs her work to this day. Since joining the Science Center in 2021, Gillespie has put her archaeology background to use by spending months researching upcoming exhibitions. Her work ranges from studying delicate waterlogged objects in TITANIC: The Artifact Exhibition, the blockbuster exhibition that closed in April, to researching the process of animation for The Science Behind Pixar, which opened May 25. Gillespie trains staff and produces supplementary materials to enhance exhibitions. She also spends a lot of time answering visitors’ questions, which is the part of her job she loves most. “I love teaching,” Gillespie says. “I didn’t think that informal education was my superpower until I started to do it.” Gina Winstead Marcus Harshaw Gretchen Baker Trương Công Tùng, installation view of the state of absence—voices from outside, 2020, in the 58th Carnegie International, Courtesy of the artist and Carnegie Museum of Art.

Story by Nichole Faina; Photos by Stephanie Strasburg Art | Community | The Inclusive Museum | Fall 2023 Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Art Reimagining Landscapes Art | Community Opening up the World for Others Art | Community Progress in the Pop District Editor’s Note: The names of all minors interviewed for this article have been changed to protect their privacy. It’s a humid Saturday night in June, and teenagers are posing for selfies on the entrance steps of The Andy Warhol Museum. They are decked out in their finest formal wear—sidewalk-sweeping gowns, vintage polyester suits a touch too tight in the shoulders, and platform heels that somebody will surely kick off in an hour. The chattering thrum is punctuated with exclamations of, “You look amazing!” and requests for one more shot. It’s prom season in America, and this scene is playing out in backyards and hotel ballrooms across the country. But what awaits these young adults inside The Warhol is more than slow dances and boutonnieres—tonight, the museum is their momentary place of refuge and relief. Since 2014, The Warhol has hosted the LGBTQ+ Youth Prom , one of the only proms catering to queer young people in southwestern Pennsylvania. The event, open to people ages 13 to 20, is a safe, gender-inclusive celebration at a time when many state and national politicians and local school boards are rolling back the social and legal advances achieved by LGBTQ+ people in the last two decades. Guests in the main lobby at the 2023 LGBTQ+ Youth Prom at The Andy Warhol Museum. “For some local queer youth who experience bullying, harassment, and even unsupportive faculty and administrators, going to their official high school prom isn’t an option,” says Mona Wiley, inclusion programs coordinator at The Warhol and a lead organizer of the prom. “The Warhol’s LGBTQ+ Youth Prom is a unique event that creates lasting memories, a sense of belonging, and the ability to participate in a significant coming-of-age milestone for attendees, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.” Seeking belonging Into the sea of sequins and sparkle on The Warhol’s dance floor enters Kai, a 16-year-old vision—shoulder-grazing turquoise locs, a sleeveless black mini dress, fishnet thigh-highs, chunky heels, and blue-tinted eyeglasses, the lenses shaped like clouds. They spot their partner, Mochi, and he presents them with a corsage of orange and yellow roses. When Mochi slides it on their wrist, they are so happy they are close to sobbing. The Warhol LGBTQ+ prom is special, Kai says, because it’s a space where they can just be. After surviving a few hellish years of bullying and harassment in their small, rural high school east of Pittsburgh, the rising junior needs a respite. “The Warhol prom means that I can be in a place where I am accepted; I get to feel safe in my community,” Kai says. “No one is judging me.” School was not a place that Kai felt safe. One student, in particular, targeted them after they came out as a lesbian by throwing sharp objects and ramming school desks into their legs. They were called “dog” by classmates in the hallway; some even threw food at Kai when they walked through the hallways. One heartbreaking afternoon, students on a school bus woofed and hollered at them as they walked on board. The Warhol prom means that I can be in a place where I am accepted; I get to feel safe in my community. No one is judging me. Kai, prom attendee The stress was debilitating, Kai says, and they sought mental health treatment. Next year, hoping to put distance between them and their harassers, Kai plans to attend high school at Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, an online public school. While LGBTQ+ youth like Kai are not predisposed to mental illness, they experience mental health issues at much higher rates than their cisgender, straight peers, including elevated risks for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, depression, and anxiety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Losing the right to be An LGBTQ+ prom is a cultural Rorschach test of sorts—for some, it’s an example of progress, of the world becoming kinder to young people who exist outside the mainstream, but to others, the very existence of queer youth is a problem. Since the start of 2023, more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures, including laws specifically targeting the rights of parents to provide gender-affirming care to their children and allowing schools to misgender transgender students and censor curriculums. Though the politicians behind the bills stated they were protecting children, the proposed laws limit the care and support that can help LGBTQ+ young people flourish. A guest relaxes in the sensory-friendly room at this year’s prom. For Kai’s parents, Jody and Randy, it’s hard to reconcile some politicians’ insistence that they know what’s right for young people. They’ve witnessed the real-life consequences when their child has been singled out for being trans. “We brought Kai to The Warhol prom because we want them to have experiences that don’t feel exclusionary. We want them to celebrate who they are,” says their mother, Jody. For Kai’s father, the onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is antithetical to his upbringing. “I just feel like, in America, our kids grow up hearing that they can be whatever they want, but now there’s a big asterisk saying, ‘You can be whatever you want, but don’t be gay,’ ” he says. “It’s stupid.” A dandy Andy, indeed The leadership and staff of all four Carnegie Museums are committed to cultivating and maintaining a welcoming environment. But The Warhol hosting an LGBTQ+ Youth Prom is especially fitting in light of Andy Warhol’s status as a queer icon, one of the most famous openly gay men of the 20th century. “Warhol’s Silver Factory art studio served as a gathering place for New York City’s LGBTQ+ community—a safe space where anyone was free to explore their sexuality and gender expression,” says Grace Marston, an arts educator who designed the curriculum of the museum’s monthly Dandy Andy tours that spotlight Andy Warhol’s romantic relationships and queer identity in the context of the gay rights movement. “Through his paintings, films, television shows, and Interview magazine, he provided platforms for queer creatives to express themselves,” she explains. “Warhol influenced many LGBTQ+ artists during his lifetime, and he continues to inspire today.” The Warhol’s LGBTQ+ Youth Prom is a unique event that creates lasting memories, a sense of belonging, and the ability to participate in a significant coming-of-age milestone for attendees, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Mona Wiley, inclusion programs coordinator at The Warhol The museum embraces and celebrates Warhol’s vanguard status through its regular programming and acquisitions. In addition to offering the monthly Dandy Andy tours and frequently presenting live, LGBTQ+-identified musical acts, the museum recently installed Anatomy of the Human by queer Nigerian American artist Mikael Owunna. The mural, funded by Citizens, is located across from the museum in Pop Park on East General Robinson Street, part of the museum’s newly launched multi-block Pop District. Those queer-positive ethics are displayed at the LGBTQ+ Youth Prom. From the pride-flag garlands draped from the pillars surrounding the dance floor to the designated sensory-friendly room, the event is designed to create a space accessible to people of all identities and abilities. The soundtrack of this year’s prom— the best singalong pop hits of the past few decades—is deftly spun by graduates of the museum’s Teen DJ Academy . The program, presented in partnership with Tech 25, is a five-week immersion taught by professional DJs, culminating in the chance to spin a live set at the LGBTQ+ Youth Prom. Some DJs are as young as 14; tonight is their first prom experience. Marcus Jones, left, 20, and Niko Hall, 18, both part of The Warhol’s Teen DJ Academy, DJ at the LGBTQ+ Youth Prom. During the event’s first hour, there’s more loitering than dancing—a few brave souls timidly step toward the center of the dance floor and then retreat to the periphery after a song or two. Finally, the raucous really kicks off with the help of the B-52’s Love Shack , and the grooving bodies reach critical mass. Although the night is by and for the promgoers, it’s meaningful for the adult volunteers in attendance as well. This is the second year that graphic artist and local business owner Jason LeViere has pitched in. While he can’t redo his junior and senior years of high school, he says witnessing these young adults’ joy and seeing them have a different experience than he did growing up is good for his heart. “I love seeing that everyone is part of one big group just cheering each other on the dance floor. There were all these different cliques when I was in school, but it’s not like that here,” says LeViere, who is gay. “I sometimes didn’t attend dances because I couldn’t bring a guy. I actually ended up planning my prom. If I couldn’t really enjoy myself, I’d put my energy elsewhere.” Here for a good time Everything about The Warhol’s prom—from this year’s title, “ Andy’s Exploding Plastic Prom ,” to the food and activities—is guided by a youth committee that meets over a period of five months. This year’s rock ’n‘ roll theme was manifested in the decorate-your-own sunglasses, CDs, and vinyl records artmaking activities, and also the floral centerpieces in mini snare-drum pots dotting the reception tables. The 2023 prom is the second one held by the museum since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and though the attendance numbers aren’t quite back to pre-pandemic levels, almost 200 youth representing 21 different schools attended this year’s prom. They hail from the Pittsburgh region and its surrounding counties: Ambridge, Beaver, Lawrence, and Butler; and while this year’s attendees represent a diverse range of genders and geographies, what’s striking is how they revel in sharing community and recognizing the value of each person. Georgia says she came to prom because her girlfriend was DJing, and The Warhol provided a “safer space” than her school dance. “I have more freedom as a queer person here. I can express myself however I like and choose whoever I want to be with. I don’t have to limit myself just because that’s what I was taught.” Nearly 200 promgoers attended The Warhol’s LGBTQ+ Youth Prom this year. Getting over a bad breakup, Sadie’s friends convinced her to go to prom—it was time for her to finally have some fun. “Kids need safe places to express themselves,” Sadie says. “We can’t be forced into boxes. As a young bi-girl growing up in the church, I always had to fit specific roles. I had to be this perfect girl, and that’s not me. The Warhol is part of the wider community of people who are active in trying to forward human rights.” Even though he served as the vice president of his school’s student gay-straight alliance, Niko Stripay still sought out connections at the LGBTQ+ Youth Prom. “Events like this one bring us together,” he says, adding, “It can hurt to feel like an outcast, and many of us do feel that way. Here we can belong with each other. It feels good.” Connection and community Kai offers more grace to the high schoolers who hurt them than most people could probably muster. “I’m not entirely sure if politicians influenced the people who bullied me or if that’s just how they were raised,” Kai says. “I consider that those students had something in their life that affected them that made them act like that.” Though Kai has struggled since coming out, they’ve always had the love and affirmation of their parents. And they’ve found their people—a community whose encouragement and acceptance provide the scaffolding to build a good life. “The best part of being queer is the supportive friends you make along the way,” Kai says. This is why The Warhol’s LGBTQ+ Youth Prom is essential programming for the museum—it creates a rare space for connection. “Young people need a place where they can celebrate their true selves,” Wiley says. “That’s why the prom will continue.” The night’s pinnacle for Kai was dancing the Electric Slide—a throwback they learned from their parents. The pleasure of line dancing is the choreography—the unity in rhythm as the group moves in sync with the music. There’s a feeling of affinity. The same feeling you get when you’re in a roomful of people who may not know you but accept you for exactly who you are.

By B. Denise Hawkins Art | Community | The Inclusive Museum | Summer 2024 Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Art Reimagining Landscapes Art | Community Opening up the World for Others Art | Community Progress in the Pop District More than 20 years ago, Carnegie Museum of Art acquired a vast record of African American life in Pittsburgh during the 20th century. It’s a treasure trove of 70,000 print images, photo negatives, and videos from the iconic Charles “Teenie” Harris, longtime photographer for The Pittsburgh Courier , one of the nation’s most prominent Black newspapers, spanning the late ’30s into the 1970s. As the museum worked to preserve and digitize the photos and identify the people portrayed in them, it organized temporary exhibitions of the collection in which viewers were treated to several dozen images at a time—of dance halls and baseball games, intimate family moments and Civil Rights protests. Often, in a single frame and unfiltered, Harris presented the seldom-seen complexity and joy of African American life and identity. Each exhibition provided snippets of what is considered one of the country’s most detailed and comprehensive photographic records of the Black urban experience. But there has never been a space that showcased all the facets of the archive at once, as Harris had always hoped. Man seated between cross-dressers “Gilda,” and “Junie” Turner wearing Caribbean-style costume with Christmas ornaments in headdress, at bar. “Harris wanted you to see it all, but he also wanted you to listen to the stories he was presenting in his art,” says Charlene Foggie-Barnett, Charles “Teenie” Harris community archivist. With every image, she adds, “He is leaving clues. He is revealing story lines and truths. He’s making a statement.” Later this year, museumgoers for the first time will be able to explore this vast archive with a reinstallation of Harris’ work in the Scaife Galleries. The new Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive Gallery will feature never-before-seen components of the archive, including reels of film in canisters, and prints, some in color. Visitors will even be able to view Harris’ photographic negatives, which make up the bulk of the collection. “We’re taking a more comprehensive, intentional, and creative approach to sharing and honoring the Teenie Harris Archive and how the photographer’s art has illuminated the city’s history,” says Dana Bishop-Root, the museum’s director of education and public programs, who worked with Foggie-Barnett and Curator of Photography Dan Leers, as well as a team of creatives, on the project. Throughout their work, which is ongoing, they considered how the museum invites, welcomes, and engages with the community—including those who knew Harris, his subjects and their families, schoolchildren, teachers, scholars, and other visitors from near and far. “Thinking about the ways that people can experience the archive has been at the forefront of our approach to sharing it,” says Bishop-Root. “We’ve long said that people need the museum, but the museum needs people to keep it alive, inclusive, vibrant, and contemporary.” Viewing ‘Teenie’ as Never Before When the exhibition opens, Harris’ films, works in color, self-portraits, negatives, and more will be available for visitors to work with, listen to, read about, see—and yes, touch—Leers says. For the first time, visitors will view Harris’ videos and still images side by side, projected on a wall using a multichannel projector. Visitors can also interact with Harris’ negatives, the thin strips of transparent plastic film that gave the photographer his first look at the subjects, using a light table stationed in the gallery. This opportunity to touch and explore the negatives is possible only because of the decades of intensive work that has gone into preserving the archive. Many of Harris’ negatives were stored in his basement studio before the museum received them. “There were a group of negatives that were seriously curled up on each other and without protective sleeves,” adds Leers. The work of restoring and digitizing them, which is nearly complete, has been intensive and daily over the past two decades. Pittsburghers first saw Harris’ photos in black and white in the pages of The Pittsburgh Courier , the city’s influential Black newspaper. For the first time, the museum will print some of those images on newsprint, giving visitors a look and feel for how Harris’ photographs appeared when they rolled off the press. Experiencing the Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive Gallery will also include seeing the photographer as never before. Harris was a month shy of his 90th birthday when he died on June 12, 1998. But in exhibitions of his work, the artist is typically portrayed as a much younger man in his 30s—bright-eyed, with finger waves in his black hair, and sporting his signature suit and tie. For the first time, the museum will present self-portraits, some in color, of Harris as an older man. Charles “Teenie” Harris, untitled, Carnegie Museum of Art, Heinz Family Fund, (c) Carnegie Museum of Art. “Deciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist,” says Leers. Those new portraits of the photographer will be interspersed in a mosaic display that features Harris’ life and career, layered with the major moments in Black history, American history, and international history he chronicled. The museum also wants to broaden and focus on the visitors who will be engaging with the work Harris created. “Deciding to present portraits of the older Harris offered an opportunity for us to broaden the personal image of Harris, and who he was as a community member, family man, and artist.” –Dan Leers, Curator of Photography, Carnegie Museum of Art Visitors to the gallery will step into an expansive space that is accessible to people of different abilities, and designed for sitting, listening, viewing, touching, reading, learning, talking, and lingering as “they experience the depth of Teenie Harris’ work and how he was looking at the world,” explains Bishop-Root. For example, the museum is outfitting the gallery space with modular seating that can easily move and be rearranged when groups and individuals come to watch a film, hear a lecture, or just talk to each other about Harris’ art. When Foggie-Barnett considers this intentional gathering space, she sees opportunities for critical conversations to also happen there: “about race, reconciling, identity, and the unknown of Black life in America,” issues she says Harris confronted in his images without saying a word.

Carnegie Museum of Art, Heinz Family Fund, © Carnegie Museum of Art Seeing Themselves in the Images As a community archivist and longtime Hill District resident, Foggie-Barnett understands the importance of forging and cultivating relationships with surrounding communities, especially with those who call the Hill District home. Much of her work has focused on identifying individuals in Harris’ images and, whenever possible, meeting with those who are still living to collect their oral histories. It’s necessary, rewarding, and ongoing work that has been “fundamental to expose the archives in ways that are personal,” says Foggie-Barnett, and that engender trust from those who share their memories and stories with the museum. One such relationship, she recalls, was with Daisy Curry Simmons, who was a young wife and mother of six when Harris photographed her on August 17, 1963. On that day, in her small, tidy bedroom, she stood in silent protest, wearing a hastily written cardboard sign on a string around her neck. It read: “Do your children live like this in Squirrel Hill? We are still human not animals.” Inside the museum, 58 years later, Curry Simmons stared for the first time at that photo of her younger self hanging in the Harris gallery.

We are still human not animals,” in small bedroom , August 1963, Heinz Family Fund, Copyright:© Carnegie Museum of Art, Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive In March 2024, Curry Simmons’ daughter called to inform Foggie-Barnett, who had collected Curry Simmons’ oral history, that her mother had passed away. That phone call, says Foggie-Barnett, represents the kind of cyclical relationship the museum wants to have with people whose lives have been touched by Harris’ work. “They embrace us if we embrace them,” Foggie-Barnett says. Carnegie Museum of Art plans to engage a lay volunteer corps over the next two years to help gather oral histories and memories from people who can speak about Harris and the lives reflected in his work. Those histories will help shape how the Harris Archive is maintained, Bishop-Root says. “Having citizen archivists who will get to experience the Harris Archive in this way is what excites me,” says Bishop-Root, who is eager to incorporate these volunteer efforts into the museum’s programming. She also sees it as a “formalized way we can ask those in the community to contribute to the knowledge and context we are building around the Teenie Harris photographs. Photo: Joshua Franzos Daisy Curry Simmons views the image of herself that Charles “Teenie” Harris photographed in 1963. “I hope that they will see themselves as adding value, in their own way.” Foggie-Barnett shares that vision of citizens as vital to helping keep the Harris Archive alive and relevant. “We are creating an opportunity for everyday citizens to become archivists who can inform the museum and then share what they are finding and learning with the world, and with family and friends.” Indeed, Foggie-Barnett is part of the community that Harris captured. On the walls of her Pittsburgh home, and included in some Harris exhibitions, are photos of her as a young girl. She had her first photo shoot with Harris when she turned 1 year old. Harris photographed the smiling Foggie-Barnett sitting on a table next to her big birthday cake. It’s one of more than 300 images Harris took of her family. She is now a well-respected “steward” of the Teenie Harris Archive, involved in preserving, curating, and broadening the collection’s reach and community relevance. Those deep roots and her memories of Harris have proven invaluable to preserving and interpreting this archive, says Leers. “Our collaboration has been incredible; especially given Charlene’s relationship to Harris and the stories she’s collected. She has shaped how I look at the different kinds of experiences and views that everyone brings, and that are unique to this reinstallation process. “I used to look at the [Harris] Archive as a record of the past,” he adds. “But now I see that it is living.” Leadership support is provided by the Drue and H.

By Cristina Rouvalis Art | Warhol | Spring 2020 Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Art Reimagining Landscapes Art | Community Opening up the World for Others Art | Community Progress in the Pop District Candy Darling knew how to channel her inner bombshell. The late transgender icon strutted on stage in glittering gowns and lush blonde wigs, a look she cultivated by studying her idol, Kim Novak. “I’ve had small parts in big pictures and big parts in small pictures,” she said of her acting career in the late 1960s and early ’70s. Working alongside Tennessee Williams in one of his original plays, Small Craft Warnings , Darling played the glamorous, sexually promiscuous Violet. She also had a knack for gritty roles in underground theater productions and the profanity-and nudity-filled films of Andy Warhol. That Warhol and Darling became close friends seemed like destiny in the era of gender-bending, glam rock music, and the decadent New York high-low art scene. “Candy really embodied this kind of uptown-downtown vibe. She was glamorous, but she was also leading this punk rock lifestyle,” says Ben Harrison, curator of performing arts and special projects at The Andy Warhol Museum. “Andy loved big personalities, and Candy was larger than life.” Cecil Beaton, Andy Warhol and Candy Darling , New York, 1969 © The Cecil Beaton Studio Archive at Sotheby’s Museumgoers can catch a glimpse of her sultry fashion sense on two blonde mannequins dressed in Darling’s authentic evening gowns, both plucked from the vast Warhol Archives numbering more than a half-million objects. Darling is among a group of groundbreaking figures with deep Warholian ties who will be featured in a new museum-wide exhibition dubbed Femme Touch , on view April 24–September 6. A collaboration between curators, educators, and archivists, the show will shine a light on nine fascinating women and femmes in Warhol’s inner circle. Collaborators, confidantes, and muses, they helped advance and shape the Pop artist’s career. Overshadowed by the force field that was Warhol, they’re often left out in the retelling of Warhol’s story, some say even by Warhol himself, their accomplishments having faded with time. “We expect this will introduce audiences to individuals they don’t know, who are both captivating and pioneering,” says José Diaz, chief curator of The Warhol and lead organizer of Femme Touch . Featured are Candy Darling and the artist’s longtime collaborator Brigid Berlin, as well as models and actresses Jane Forth and Donna Jordan, who changed the definition of beauty in the freewheeling ’70s. The presentation puts Warhol’s work in dialogue with artifacts from the lives of these influential innovators, as well as with those of his fellow stars of underground cinema: actress and singer Tally Brown, influential filmmaker Barbara Rubin, and award-winning drag performer Mario Montez. It also reexamines the story of writer Valerie Solanas—Warhol’s would-be assassin—and his beloved mother, Julia Warhola. “Women were very important in Warhol’s life, starting with his mother, Julia. He worked in a very feminine universe, first as a commercial illustrator for the fashion industry and later as court painter to the rich and famous.” – Jose Diaz, chief curator of The Warhol All but Solanas, Warhola, and Rubin are known as Warhol “Superstars,” a unique clique of characters who inspired the artist and whose thirst for individuality and fame rivaled his own. Perhaps the most famous of the Superstars, socialite Edie Sedgwick, became the ’60s “it girl” only partly through her relationship with Warhol. Because her story is so well known, she’s not a central focus of Femme Touch . But Sedgwick and other usual suspects such as Velvet Underground icon Nico and actress Susan Bottomly, known as International Velvet, do make significant appearances in rarely exhibited, color Warhol films screened on the museum’s second floor. It’s there where visitors can also surround themselves with an impressive number and variety of Warhol’s famous silkscreened portraits of women and femmes. Among those featured: Jackie Kennedy, Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, Judy Garland, and Wilhelmina Ross, who in 2019 was identified as one of Warhol’s sitters for his commissioned Ladies and Gentlemen series featuring anonymous drag queens and transgender women of color. Warhol the experimental filmmaker often provided little instruction to the talent; instead, he would set up the camera, turn it on, and encourage his stars to act largely like themselves. Through this process, he invented his own idea of the Superstar, characterized by the motley crew of actresses, models, drag queens, socialites, and artists he hung around with at his New York studio, the Silver Factory. Femme Touch takes the lesser-known, larger-than-life figures out of the shadows, all the while adding rich context to the world in which Warhol lived. “Women were very important in Warhol’s life, starting with his mother, Julia,” Diaz says. “He worked in a very feminine universe, first as a commercial illustrator for the fashion industry and later as court painter to the rich and famous. Many in his inner circle were gifted artists in their own right, and they inspired him.” Film Poster ( Women in Revolt ), 1971, The Andy Warhol Museum; Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Pushing Boundaries Decades before Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner graced magazine covers, there was Candy Darling. Artifacts of her short but dazzling life are on display on the museum’s fifth floor. Darling became a transgender trailblazer who starred in Warhol’s movies Flesh (1968) and Women in Revolt (1971). She counted as her friends A-list celebrities such as Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dennis Hopper. Director John Waters, another friend, once said of her star power, “Candy fit in perfectly because she was like a real movie star from MGM, only in a world that was filled with LSD and speed.” In one film clip, Darling recites lines from Kim Novak movies to a young and astonished Dennis Hopper. “It’s almost as though she is auditioning for him, and he seems so enamored with her,” Harrison says. Darling’s early death—she died of lymphoma in 1974 at age 29—prevented her from ever achieving the mainstream stardom she dreamed of. Peter Beard, Donna Jordan and Jane Forth , ca. 1970 © 2019 Peter Beard/Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York Fellow Superstars Jane Forth and Donna Jordan were discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez in Central Park. “Antonio’s Girls,” a group of beauties that also includes Jessica Lange and Jerry Hall, changed the idea of the runway model with their unconventional style and bold personalities. Inspired by the ’20s, Forth had an art deco look, her hair slicked with Wesson cooking oil and her eyebrows plucked to tiny apostrophes. Jordan, nicknamed Disco Marilyn, exuded ’70s glamour. A fourth-floor installation will show Forth and Jordan starring in Warhol’s film L’Amour , a comedy about American beauties showing up in Paris and becoming gold-digging supermodels. Never before shown glamour shots, borrowed from the archives of Antonio Lopez and Chris von Wangenheim, will be displayed, as well as photos of the models in Warhol’s Interview magazine. As Diaz notes, “They pushed the extremes of gender through hyper-femininity but also androgyny.” Androgynous style was also evident in the 1971 Warhol play, Pork , which is brought to life in the exhibition through photographs and snippets of its experimental dialogue. A satiric and bawdy look at life at the Silver Factory, Warhol adapted Pork from taped conversations, and its influence on popular culture was lasting. Turns out David Bowie went to see Pork in August of that year, during its run in London. “The wild exhibitionistic cast, the androgyny, and the gender play of Pork seem to have been an influence and inspiration reflected in the aesthetic of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars album released almost a year later in June 1972,” Harrison says. Ziggy Stardust became an androgynous bisexual, and Bowie’s manager Tony Defries hired a few of the cast and crew members from Pork to work for his production company, MainMan, in New York. Songs by David Bowie, Lou Reed, and other glam rock musicians help set the scene in this gallery. Though Pork inspired Bowie, it annoyed critics. Newspaper clippings with scathing reviews are mounted on a gallery wall. “It’s very tongue-in-cheek. A lot of the cast was nude and it was pretty profane,” Harrison says. “The dialogue was mostly non-linear and absurdist.” Museumgoers pick up a rotary phone to listen to two local actors, Lissa Brennan and Brian Siewiorek, reading the lines from the groundbreaking stage production, specifically recorded for the installation. The script was partially based on transcripts of tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Warhol, and conversations between Berlin and her mother, Honey Berlin. Brigid Berlin, Self-Portrait , ca. 1969, The Andy Warhol Museum; Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. The daughter of Richard Berlin, chairman of Hearst Media, Brigid Berlin was born in 1939 into great wealth and was groomed to be a socialite. She was a self-proclaimed “overweight troublemaker,” says Danielle Linzer, director of learning and public engagement at The Warhol. “As a girl, her mom would give her diet pills and give her cash for every pound she lost.” Instead of hobnobbing with Manhattan’s upper crust, Berlin rebelled by living a bohemian lifestyle. When she visited the Silver Factory in 1964, she knew she had found her tribe. While other women cycled in and out of Warhol’s orbit, sometimes upset that he didn’t pay them to be in movies or he had moved on to the next star, Berlin was a bosom friend and sounding board to Warhol until his death in 1987. Berlin was a brash exhibitionist and naturally provocative performer, frequently appearing topless and making “tit prints” by using her bare breasts to imprint paint onto canvas. She was nicknamed Brigid Polk because of her habit of giving her friends at the Silver Factory “pokes,” injections of vitamin B and amphetamines. For all her antics, she was a prolific artist. The Polaroid portraits she made of herself, Warhol, and other Silver Factory dwellers—some of them superimposed in front of Warhol’s own artworks—are included in the exhibition. Berlin, who still lives in New York, appeared in an impressive number of Warhol films, including Chelsea Girls . Like Warhol, she compulsively taped conversations, and was known for her signature double-exposed Polaroids. When Berlin had gallstones removed, she wrapped them up in a box and gave them to Warhol with a note that read, “Now you have three of my most precious stones from my gallbladder. Friday, February 19, 1982. Much love, Brigid.” A Life-Changing Encounter The fifth-floor also contains sentimental notes Berlin wrote to Warhol while he was convalescing in the hospital after he was shot and nearly killed on June 3, 1968, by Valerie Solanas. From the movie I Shot Andy Warhol to an episode of American Horror Story , Solanas looms large in pop culture. But her story goes beyond the “party line of a crazy ‘feminist’ who shot Warhol for fame,” says Nicole Dezelon, associate director of learning at The Warhol. Instead of the stereotypical trope, the exhibition tells the deeper tale of Solanas’ unhappy life, filled with abuse, trauma, and undiagnosed mental illness. We learn that she ran away from home at age 15 after claiming sexual and physical abuse from both her father and grandfather. “She fell into this relationship with a married man and ended up having a child that she had to give up for adoption,” Dezelon says. “She had a very rough start.” She turned to panhandling and prostitution to support herself. Despite early trauma, Solanas earned a degree in psychology at the University of Maryland and took a few courses at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1967, she wrote the Society for Cutting Up Men (SCUM) Manifesto, arguing that men had ruined the world, with a call to take back everything men destroyed. “She has been characterized as a radical feminist writer but she never called herself a feminist,” Dezelon notes. Newspaper section (Daily News – Vol. 49, no. 296, June 4, 1968) , The Andy Warhol Museum; Founding Collection, Contribution The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. Solanas also wrote the play titled Up Your Ass , and she gave her only copy to Warhol. She had interactions with the artist but was more of a hanger-on than a member of his avant-garde world. Warhol told her she was a wonderful typist and that she should come work for him at the Silver Factory—a comment that likely set her off, Dezelon says. Warhol seemingly forgot about her play and misplaced it, but in Solanas’ paranoid mind, Warhol was stealing her work. The exhibition will include news footage from the day of the shooting showing the bullet holes found in the Silver Factory window and the Daily News headline—“Actress Shoots Andy Warhol. Cries ‘He Controlled My Life,’”—her words when she turned herself in to police. On display are photos of Warhol’s scars and one of the extra-small corsets he was forced to wear after Solanas shot him in the abdomen. He wore the undergarments, many of which Berlin hand-dyed a variety of colors, to help support his organs. The shooting was such a traumatic event that he closed the Factory’s doors to outsiders and became what friend and photographer Billy Name coined “Cardboard Andy,” so sensitized that he couldn’t be touched without jumping from fear. “There is one camp who thinks he exploited women and another camp thinks he helped many women’s careers. Like everything else with Warhol, it’s a matter of opinion.” – Nicole Dezelon, associate director of learning at The Warhol The stories in the exhibition highlight two conflicting theories of Warhol’s relationships to the uniquely talented women and femmes who hung around the Silver Factory. “There is one camp who thinks he exploited women and another camp thinks he helped many women’s careers,” Dezelon says. “Like everything else with Warhol, it’s a matter of opinion.” Diaz says Warhol had complicated relationships with his Superstars and other women in his orbit, but the most ambitious ones saw Warhol as a stepping stone to their own brilliant careers. “We are not trying to credit Warhol,” he says. “We are crediting these fascinating women who deserve to have their stories told.” n Femme Touch is presented by Bank of America and Steven Alan Bennett and Dr. Elaine Melotti Schmidt, Founders of The Bennett Collection of Women Realists.

Photo: John Schisler A Knotty Conversation Botanists at Carnegie Museum of Natural History are researching new ways to discuss invasive plants. By Chris Fleisher Science & Nature | Summer 2024 Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Science & Nature Curate This Community | Science & Nature ‘We Do Still Exist, and We’re Thriving.’ Science & Nature Objects of Our Affection: Gort Anybody who has walked Pittsburgh’s riverfronts has seen it covering the shorelines—a dense, bushy, broad-leafed plant known as knotweed. Sometimes reaching 9 feet high, knotweed spreads prolifically wherever it takes root and is nearly impossible to manage. The deer won’t eat it and there isn’t a group of volunteers large enough to rip it by the roots before it spreads. That’s why botanist Mason Heberling was curious when, several years ago, he heard of a “knotweed festival” held every August in Blairsville, Pennsylvania. He wondered why this borough 42 miles east of Pittsburgh would celebrate what botanists consider an invasive species. So, he checked it out, and found that it was more of a celebration of the waterfront than a festival promoting the pesky plant. “It was more of a friendly nod, not really a celebration of knotweed,” recalls Heberling, the associate curator in the Section of Botany at Carnegie Museum of Natural History. “Kind of like if you have lemons, make lemonade.” It was a new way of framing the conversation around invasive species that has proven instructive for Heberling and Rachel Reeb, a postdoctoral fellow at the museum, in their work to educate the public. Funded by a $225,000 grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, Reeb and Heberling are spearheading educational outreach initiatives about invasive plants in partnership with Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, Pittsburgh Botanic Garden, and other organizations. They’ve held workshops with partner organizations, surveyed members of the public, and researched new ways of integrating messaging in museum exhibition spaces. The initiative will culminate in its own exhibition about invasive flora and fauna in 2025. Invasive species—those that have been transported by humans to an area outside their natural range and cause societal or environmental harm—are a massive concern around the world. Invasive plants can crowd out important food sources for local wildlife and displace rare and culturally significant flora. Globally, invasive species are one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss and extinction. They can damage public infrastructure, like highways, and be expensive to manage. A 2021 study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment estimated that invasive species have cost North America more than $26 billion a year since 2010, and the economic cost of invasive species globally has been $1.3 trillion over the past 50 years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Yet, it’s rarely discussed in museum spaces. “A lot of people don’t think about this at all,” says Sarah Crawford, the Museum of Natural History’s director of exhibitions and design. “So it gives us an opportunity to open a dialogue about it.” When public education campaigns actually do address invasive species, the issue is often couched in alarmist language that misplaces blame for the problem. Some have employed “Wanted” posters that cheekily characterize certain species as villains that need to be banished. But the plants didn’t bring themselves here. A lot of them are ornamental or culinary, which humans intentionally introduced. “It’s not the plant’s fault. It’s our actions that are leading to this,” Crawford says. “That seems like a very basic message, but just telling the story in that way will be very different from what other museums are doing.” Messaging campaigns about invasive species can also employ nativistic language that echoes some of the harmful anti-immigration rhetoric infused in geopolitics. Some social scientists have raised ethical questions about the way botanists talk about some species not “belonging” to a place, similar to the way hate groups have talked about migrants. It doesn’t help that many invasives have geopolitical names—Chinese wisteria, Japanese barberry, Russian olive, Oriental bittersweet. Then there’s Japanese knotweed. When talking with the public, Heberling occasionally has noticed a mumbled allusion to immigration politics when he mentions Japanese knotweed, but those moments are rare. More common are exasperated responses about what to do about it. Like with climate change, discussions of how to address the problem of invasive plants can easily become overwhelming. “We will never completely solve the problem of knotweed, and people will always have to deal with it in their land management,” Reeb says. “But we’re trying to spread this message that you have an opportunity to prevent the next knotweed of the future.” That was the vibe they noticed in Blairsville last summer, when Heberling and Reeb tabled at the knotweed festival. “We will never completely solve the problem of knotweed, and people will always have to deal with it in their land management. But we’re trying to spread this message that you have an opportunity to prevent the next knotweed of the future.” –Rachel Reeb, postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Museum of Natural History The event—which included a parade, petting zoo, vendors, and crafts—wasn’t actually about highlighting the threats posed by knotweed. Rather, it was a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the plant that covers the borough’s waterways. Many festivalgoers didn’t even know that knotweed was invasive. Others chose to embrace their new reality by turning the plant into crafts or making knotwood soap. In this more relaxed context, Heberling and Reeb were able to have constructive conversations with the public about an issue many had never before considered. This is not to say that Reeb and Heberling want to spur complacency. Rather, they are looking for better ways of convincing people to care about this problem. Their exhibition, slated to open next year at the Museum of Natural History, is still being developed, but it will likely be integrated into the Hall of Botany as well as function as a stand-alone exhibition on the third floor overlook that tells a more expanded story. Reeb notes, “By highlighting stories about invasive species and their impact on our environment and our society, we’re hoping to promote a sense of responsibility.” Receive more stories in your email Sign up Tags: Science & Nature Carnegie Museum of Art Carnegie Science Center Carnegie Museum of Natural History The Andy Warhol Museum Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn Things to Do Visit Join & Support Event Spaces About Us Carnegie Magazine Accessibility Press Opportunities Connect with our museums Social Media, Blogs, Apps & More > ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Privacy Policy Terms of Use Non-Discrimination Policy Join Donate",

Not even in his wildest imaginings did he think that one day he would be the guy responsible for creating animated “crowds” of scurrying rats ( Ratatouille ), free-falling spaceship passengers ( Wall•E ), and trash-talking dogs ( Up ). From a tech perspective, his job is all about harnessing computer apps to plot the movements of massive gatherings of animated characters. But what makes his animations seem so realistic is how he captures the disparate, individual behaviors that occur within crowds, so that when viewed as a whole the scenes leap off the screen. “It comes down to good old-fashioned spectacle,” Kanyuk says. “Crowds are just awe-inspiring.” Back in the late ’90s, the technology that would enable such intricate scenes still seemed like the stuff of science fiction—not an actual job. So, when the now 40-year-old Kanyuk first began picturing what a career as an animator might look like, he saw a blank canvas just waiting to be brought to life at the hands of a talented artist. After all, that’s how those Disney classics, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Lion King , were created—one frame at a time, 24 frames per second. “I just assumed people drew everything by hand,” Kanyuk recalls. He quickly realized that he had a lot to learn—and much of it was rooted in science and math. Consequently, the self-proclaimed nerd got busy. In 2005, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor of science in engineering degree in digital media design and minors in fine arts and psychology. Kanyuk also continues to add animation apps (Maya, Houdini, and RenderMan, to name a few) and computer programming (C/C++/C#, Python, and Lua) to his ever-expanding resume. “It’s like pulling back the curtain on how these movies are made. So, the next time you see a Pixar movie, you’ll experience it in a different way. You’ll realize how many hundreds of people contributed to it, you’ll understand the complexity of the process, and you’ll appreciate how revolutionary the technology truly is. “ –Jason Brown, Henry Buhl, Jr., Director of the Science Center Yet he still hasn’t lost his kid-like wonder needed to spark an idea and the brainpower required to transform that idea into movie magic. The complex science and art behind Pixar’s animations are now on display in The Science Behind Pixar , which opened May 25 at Carnegie Science Center. The exhibition reveals the wizardry—or, more accurately, the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) skills that have enabled the making of such modern-day classics as Toy Story , A Bug’s Life , Monsters, Inc. , Finding Nemo (and Dory ), The Incredibles , Cars , Brave , Inside Out , and Coco, to name just a few. “It’s like pulling back the curtain on how these movies are made,” says Jason Brown, Henry Buhl, Jr., Director of the Science Center and vice president  of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.  “So, the next time you see a Pixar movie, you’ll experience it in a different way. You’ll realize how many hundreds of people contributed to it, you’ll understand the complexity of the process, and you’ll appreciate how revolutionary the technology truly is.” Stem Skills of Animation The 14,000-square-foot exhibition features larger-than-life 3D models of Buzz Lightyear, Dory, Mike and Sulley, Edna Mode, and Wall•E—who, by the way, are all available  for selfies. The exhibition also offers a behind-the-scenes look into Pixar’s creative process. It can take four-plus years to move a project through the nine stages of development—story and art, modeling, rigging, surfaces, sets and cameras, animation, simulation, lighting, and rendering. “This exhibit offers people a hands-on opportunity to understand how we make our films,” says Pixar President Jim Morris. “We  use science, technology, engineering, art, and math—along with a significant dash of creativity and fun—and this exhibit is truly a great demonstration of how all those ingredients come together in our filmmaking process.” With more than 50 interactive stations, the exhibition invites visitors to work through the STEM-related challenges Pixar artists and creators often encounter. The modeling stage, for instance, starts with sketches and clay sculptures. From there, digital modelers make virtual 3D wireframes to define each character’s unique shape. An understanding of anatomy—knowing where bones and muscles are located—is essential for an accurate portrayal. The sets-and-cameras phase of the process calls for set designers to serve as the architects who build the virtual environments—that includes every pebble, tree, and structure—from the ground up. Camera artists are the cinematographers. For them, physics becomes a part of the equation as they determine the composition, camera movement, and lens type for each frame. Simulation is where scenes start to come alive and look believable. For example, as characters move, so should their hair and clothing. This is where technical directors using physics-based computer programs come into play. Their job is to create the right balance of effects—too much or too little movement will leave viewers thinking something isn’t quite right. “The fact that this exhibit even exists shows how much the field has changed,” Kanyuk says. “And I think that’s great. As more people learn, explore, and discover what animation involves, the better able they will be to express themselves through this medium.” As long as the machines haven’t taken over the world, it’s the humans who are calling the shots. “ The Science Behind Pixar helps people understand that what they see on screen doesn’t just happen by computers alone,” Brown says. “It’s a human brain, with the assistance of computers, that’s figuring how to make things happen.” And that means a lot of trial and error, hit or miss. In other words, the scientific method in practice. You know the drill: Make an observation, form a hypothesis, predict an outcome, conduct an experiment, figure out the results, and repeat until you get it right. “Think about the character Merida from Brave ,” Brown adds. “Think about how the animators applied the principles of gravity so that her very long hair moves naturally. When we watch the movie, it looks seamless. But these moments are only accomplished after tremendous amounts of work—after failing fast and failing often.” That same philosophy can be applied to the development of the exhibition itself. About 10 years ago, Boston’s Museum of Science approached Pixar with the idea of highlighting the science in animation. From concept to completion, the realization of that idea was years in the making. Now, nearly a decade after its debut, the exhibition continues to be popular and relevant, having made stops at nearly 20 museums around the world. “We want to inspire the next generation of filmmakers,” says Pixar exhibition designer Brianne Moseley. “We want young people to embrace math and science concepts as a creative endeavor and, if they do, then that might lead to more creative exploration and animation in the future.” Continuing To Push Boundaries If you think about it, that’s how Pixar got its start. After taking moviegoers on an adventure to a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars director George Lucas returned to Earth and set his sights on exploring the uncharted territory of computer-generated imagery (CGI). To that end, he established the Computer Division of Lucasfilm in 1979. “Art is a technological medium,” Lucas once told Cinemablend, an online news forum for film lovers. “So, a lot of it has to do with engineering and trying to figure out how to create what you imagine.” By 1986, another visionary got in on the action. The once and future Apple CEO Steve Jobs purchased the group, and the company was rechristened Pixar Animation Studios. For the next few years, Pixar quietly produced short films and television commercials. But in 1991, the company partnered with Disney and took a bold step forward by proclaiming its intent to create the first full-length computer-animated movie. “ This exhibit offers people a hands-on opportunity to understand how we make our films. We use science, technology, engineering, art, and math—along with a significant dash of creativity and fun—and this exhibit is truly a great demonstration of how all those ingredients come together in our filmmaking process. “ –Jim Morris, Pixar President Four years later, Toy Story hit the big screen, and the world was forever changed. Opening No. 1 at the box office, the movie went on to become the highest-grossing film of 1995, taking in more than $550 million worldwide. Academy Award® nominations for Best Original Song, Best Original Score, and Best Original Screenplay (the first time an animated film was recognized for screenwriting) followed. In 2006, the Walt Disney Company purchased Pixar. Today, Pixar is still promising to take moviegoers—and, thanks to exhibitions like The Science Behind Pixar , museumgoers—to infinity and beyond. “Both this show and the Science Center are talking about STEM,” Brown says. “STEM isn’t just engineering and isn’t just math; it’s a blending of science, aesthetics, and design. It’s critical thinking. It’s problem-solving in the real world. And it’s the perfect embodiment of our mission here at the Science Center. Our goal is to connect people and science and inspire a curiosity that will endure for a lifetime.” A lifetime of learning can start when you least expect. “We want people to continue the conversation long after they leave the building,” Brown continues. “We want them to say, ‘Wow, maybe I could do that, maybe that’s a job for me.’ Maybe they’ll go home and look for some free software to see what they can create. Maybe they’ll realize that even if they want to be an artist, mathematics is important.” That’s something Kanyuk can relate to. “If I knew that math and science would have helped me make beautiful art and imagery, I would have paid more attention when I was young,” he says. Now he has another reason to appreciate the exhibition. “I just had my first kid, and taking him to the [exhibition] would just be the coolest way to explain to him what his dad does for a living.” Sponsored by Pepsi and Eat’n Park.

By Sally Quinn Science & Nature | Carnegie Magazine Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Science & Nature Curate This Community | Science & Nature ‘We Do Still Exist, and We’re Thriving.’ Science & Nature Objects of Our Affection: Gort Past the arid oranges and ruddy browns of the Science Center’s exhibition on the red planet, lush green vegetation grows in towers that stretch toward the 25-foot ceiling. “This is actually a working farm,” says Marcus Harshaw , senior director of museum experiences at Carnegie Science Center, who headed the creation of Mars: The Next Giant Leap , a permanent exhibition that opened last November. “When you come back and see all this green, it’s like, wait a minute—what’s going on?” These hydroponic systems follow the mission of the 7,400-square-foot exhibition to imagine what it would take to survive and thrive on Mars in a climate-controlled environment. Food would be of utmost importance, along with resource management. “Everything we grow here scientifically suggests we would grow them on Mars in a similar fashion,” Harshaw says. “We’re not going to transport a lot of materials to Mars. We’ll have to grow a lot of it ourselves.” Plants range from the curly tendrils of sugar pod peas to leafy kale, from strawberries to sweet peppers and radishes. There are herbs to keep Martian meals tasty, like parsley, thyme, and oregano. In a unique farm-to-table design, all the harvested produce feeds the creatures downstairs in the Science Center’s living collection. Romaine lettuce is a favorite of the turtles, while the insects, including the supersize grasshoppers, will munch everything down to its roots. The farm produces about a pound per week, but the team hopes to build that to 8 pounds per week to fill the animals’ needs. Much thought goes into choosing plants beyond the palates of the Science Center’s creatures, though. Multiuse plants help illustrate how earthlings on Mars might make best use of nutrition and resources within space constraints. Carla Littleton, animal and habitats manager at the Science Center, whose department took on the farming duties, points to the nasturtium with its lily-pad-like leaves as an example. “The flowers are edible,” Littleton says. “They’re very high in vitamin A and vitamin C. The leaves are edible. They are very similar to spinach. And the seeds are high in protein.” Littleton was brought into the Mars project development team early on. With a background in agricultural science and education, they were a serendipitous in-house find to work on the farming aspect of the exhibition. “We were trying to look at not only what would feed our animals, but what kind of plants would you need on Mars?” Littleton says. “You wouldn’t be able to take all of your medicine with you. Your best bet is to have the plants there that would produce that medicine. Hence, medicinal herbs grow among the plant collection.” “Everything we grow here scientifically suggests we would grow them on Mars in a similar fashion.” – Marcus Harshaw, Senior Director of Museum Experiences at Carnegie Science Center Mental health is another consideration, with research looking into how living alongside and tending live plants can be helpful on Earth, let alone on a desolate place like Mars. Littleton hopes to add a small willow tree whose bark can be used to create aspirin. There’s even a rubber plant that could provide adhesives for repairs on the Martian habitat. Who wants to wait for that next shipment when it’s coming from 300 million miles away? Littleton has embraced their duties with an infectious enthusiasm. They hope to surprise some visitors by including more unexpected plants like pineapple and Brussels sprouts because of their unusual growth. (A pineapple grows in the center of a big plant that looks like an agave, while Brussels sprouts grow on a big stick.) Pumpkins are also on the list. The Mars team knows they’re hitting the mark when visitors ask the all-important question: “Can I do this at home?” Pittsburgh is a city with a lot of “food deserts”—communities without ready access to healthy and affordable food—and Littleton is eager to demonstrate how residents of those communities could address this problem within their own neighborhoods. “We’ve taken this and made demonstrations to teach people how to build tabletop ones for themselves out of things they can buy locally,” Littleton says, “because this is important. This is something we can do on another planet, but how can we take this and address current issues, social issues, and community issues?” The Martian farm is a small example of how space program research brings about innovations that improve life on Earth, such as GPS, solar cells, LASIK surgery, and insulin pumps. Here, we see how even imagining those possibilities can lead to change. While hydroponic systems are not new, they are likely to become more widely used as drought and flood due to climate change compromise traditional farming practices, as well as home gardening. “As we move forward from here on our own planet, it’s all about resource use,” Harshaw says. “When you have less water to use, if you have less space, how can you grow things?” The Science Center’s smallest hydroponic system cycles 43 gallons of water for two weeks, for example, while a home gardener might use 43 gallons of water per day to replenish their plants. “I’m hoping that people see this,” he says, “and what they take away is thinking about how they can better use resources on Earth today because of how they are going to have to use resources on Mars tomorrow.” Receive more stories in your email Sign up Tags: Science & Nature Carnegie Museum of Art Carnegie Science Center Carnegie Museum of Natural History The Andy Warhol Museum Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn Things to Do Visit Join & Support Event Spaces About Us Carnegie Magazine Accessibility Press Opportunities Connect with our museums Social Media, Blogs, Apps & More > ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Privacy Policy Terms of Use Non-Discrimination Policy Join Donate",

Carnegie Museum of Natural History hopes to help connect those seeking solutions. By Jason Bittel Science & Nature | Winter 2019 Print Share Tweet Share Email | Text Size: A A A You May Also Like Science & Nature Curate This Community | Science & Nature ‘We Do Still Exist, and We’re Thriving.’ Science & Nature Objects of Our Affection: Gort Since 1864, the Sisters of the Humility of Mary have operated the 759-acre Villa Maria Farm less than a mile from the Pennsylvania-Ohio border. And while much has changed over the last century and a half, like hiring people from outside the convent to till the land and manage its forests, to this day the farm still gives half its yearly harvest to local food banks. Villa Maria Farm in Lawrence County. But lately, a different sort of change has become increasingly difficult to ignore. Too much rain. Farmers need rain to water their crops, but too much of it renders fields impassable. “When you have a farm at our scale, you have to use tractors,” says John Moreira, director of land management for the Sisters of the Humility of Mary. “You’ve got to be able to put an 8,000-pound piece of metal on that ground.” Take potatoes. To avoid frost, the ideal time of year to plant the vegetable is mid-May. But this year, it rained all the way through May. And it didn’t let up in June. “You might get three to four days of sun in a row, but that’s not enough to dry the soil so that you can put a tractor on it,” says Moreira. By July, he had to make a choice: plant the root stock he had or throw it all away. (Potatoes grown specifically for others to plant for a crop are known as seed potatoes. Unlike regular seeds, seed potatoes can’t be stored for long before they start to decompose.) Moreira went ahead and put three-quarters of an acre’s worth of potatoes in the ground to try to salvage some of the season. “Then, of course, it rained and rained and rained afterwards,” straight through July, “and most of that rotted,” he says. By the time everything was said and done, Moreira ended up with a quarter of a crop—so little, it nearly cost him more to pick the potatoes than they were worth. “The last couple years have been really bad,” he says. “Every farmer’s in the same boat as I am this year. Every farmer is not making the usual income they used to be able to make.” The Pittsburgh region saw more rain in 2018 than ever before in recorded history, a fact that might have been an outlier if it hadn’t also been true for cities throughout the Midwest and Northeast. Sioux Falls, Green Bay, Louisville, Asheville, Columbus, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Scranton—in all, 22 cities experienced record-breaking rainfalls last year. In the month of June alone, rescue workers had to perform 66 swift-water rescues across Allegheny County to save people stranded by floods. And that’s just one year in an overarching trend. Since 1958, major precipitation events in the Northeast have increased by 55 percent—the largest such shift of any region in the U.S. While they often get less media coverage, rural areas were underwater, too. “On June 20th of 2018, we had a historic flood in Ligonier, the greatest flood that anybody can remember,” says John Wenzel, director of Powdermill Nature Reserve, Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s biological field station about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. “Nothing like that’s happened in 100 years. And not very long after, we had another flood.” Up north, it’s been the same story. Powdermill Nature Reserve during last summer’s historic flooding in Ligonier. “We’re getting all kinds of flooding questions,” says Jay Russell, district manager of the Mercer County Conservation District. Sometimes the calls come from people who can’t mow their lawns because they’re too wet or from people with trees dying off because they’ve drowned. Other times it’s a whole community looking for solutions to problems they never had before. “I was just out this morning at a township that had seven inches of rain in about two hours. And that was just one storm,” says Russell. “They’ve had multiple storms now, and there are three four-foot gullies in the side of the road. How many roads have we had to close in Mercer County this year?” By all accounts, the world around us is changing. The evidence is both anecdotal—Russell has a picture of his son holding a bright yellow dandelion plucked from his yard on December 15—and also rooted in data—Powdermill’s records indicate that birds now breed about two weeks earlier than they did in 1961. Of course, a single thread connects it all. But for some, saying those words aloud—climate change—can feel provocative or, frankly, like more hassle than it’s worth. And that’s where Carnegie Museum of Natural History hopes to come in. The climate is changing Eight in 10 Americans now believe not only that climate change exists but that human actions are fueling the shift, according to a new poll conducted by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another study from Yale and George Mason Universities discovered that 69 percent of Americans are “worried” about the effects of climate change, while another 29 percent describe themselves as “very worried.” A third poll, this one conducted by Muhlenberg College and the University of Michigan in October 2019, found that only 13 percent of Americans said they saw no evidence of climate change, the lowest level of skepticism seen out of 21 such surveys dating back to 2008. But far too often, people living in rural areas are left out of the climate conversation, despite the fact that they, too, are feeling its impacts, says Laurie Giarratani, director of education at Carnegie Museum of Natural History. And it’s time to bring them to the table. “We all have to be part of the solution,” says Giarratani. “And having polarization between the city and rural areas, it’s an impediment to actually solving problems.” This past July, the museum was awarded more than $1.2 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF)—the largest NSF award the museum has ever received—to develop a path forward. Known as the Climate and Rural Systems Partnership (CRSP), the idea is to create a network of educators, scientists, and community leaders all over western Pennsylvania that can foster relationships and serve as a resource for rural communities coming to grips with the effects of climate change, as well as think together how rural areas can help lead solutions. “We all have to be part of the solution. And having polarization between the city and rural areas, it’s an impediment to actually solving problems.” – Laurie Giarratani, Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s director of education The partnership will build off the successes of an earlier museum program aimed at the city of Pittsburgh. Dubbed the Climate and Urban Systems Partnership (CUSP), it continues to nurture relationships with several dozen civic-minded organizations, such as the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, CommuteInfo, Nine Mile Run Watershed Association, Green Building Alliance, Tree Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse. Educators who participate in the Climate and Urban Systems Partnership share hands-on activities at local events, where they show small, achievable solutions to local climate-based issues, such as how adding green infrastructure—trees, rain barrels, and gardens—can help curb urban flooding. For the rural iteration, the museum’s hope is to grow the network out of places that are already wrestling with the issue, such as Powdermill Nature Reserve and Munnell Run Farm, which is owned by the county of Mercer and operated in conjunction with the Mercer County Conservation District. Munnell Run Farm in Mercer County. By holding workshops, collaborative design sessions, and community events, the hope is not just to bring different groups of people together but also equip them to better engage with community stakeholders who are already seeing climate impacts. The museum is the perfect umbrella with which to do this work because it’s already viewed as a trusted resource and space for learning, says Giarratani, who is spearheading the initiative along with Nicole Heller, the museum’s curator of the Anthropocene. Heller sees the collaboration as a learning opportunity. “I’ve been doing climate communication for a long time, and early on it was all about just delivering the information,” she says. “And for so many reasons, that didn’t work.” Study after study has shown that people aren’t moved by data alone, says Heller. Which is why the museum’s proven approach values things like relationships and trust building, context and humility. Yes, humility. “We can’t act as if we have all the answers,” she says. Teens participate in a stream study at Powdermill. The forest for the trees “You see that stump over there?” Russell asks as he walks through a 10-acre stand of sustainable timber on Munnell Run Farm, which is about a mile north of downtown Mercer. “That was an ash tree that was about 80 to 100 years old.” The tree had to be cut down this year, as did countless other ash trees in the area, thanks to an influx of shimmery green insects known as emerald ash borers. They feed on the leaves of ash trees as adults, but it’s the insect’s babies, or larvae, that really damage the trees by eating their inner bark and cutting off the supply of nutrients. The beetles, which are native to Asia, were transported to Michigan in the early 2000s. They’ve since radiated outwards as far as New Hampshire and Georgia. Worse still, experts previously thought that cold winters could hold the borers at bay, but a study published in 2018 estimated that climate change may enable them to spread as far north as the Canadian cities of Winnipeg and Calgary. Invasive species are an important talking point for the Munnell Run Farm and Mercer County Conservation District. In addition to producing crops, cattle, and even trout destined for local streams, the farm serves as a year-round education hub for anyone who wants to learn about forestry management, more holistic agriculture, pollinator services, and a litany of other practices that hover around a central theme: How can we reduce our impact on the environment while also sustainably benefiting from all it has to offer? Water chestnut is another invasive species Russell hates to see, because of the way the Eurasian plant can dominate a body of water. Water chestnuts create dense mats of floating leaves that choke out native species by monopolizing the access to light and oxygen. The plants can also make boating and swimming dangerous, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove. The increases in precipitation and flooding events brought about by climate change give invasive water chestnuts more opportunities to spread. Young conservationists remove invasive water chestnut from their local waterways. And then there are the ticks. Black-legged ticks, or deer ticks, aren’t an invasive species—they’ve always been here. But now they’re occurring in densities bordering on plague proportions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, milder winters and higher humidity levels that are part and parcel with climate change in western Pennsylvania are allowing the arachnids to prosper like never before. Talk to anyone who spends time in the outdoors and they’ll tell you, things are just different now. “It’s crazy,” says Jacqueline McCullough, environmental education coordinator for the Mercer County Conservation District. “I used to love playing in leaves as a kid, but now I’m out there yelling at my own kids, ‘Don’t jump in that pile of leaves!’” Apart from feasting on the blood of mammals, ticks can transmit various pathogens to humans, most notably the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Russell has family members with Lyme disease, he says. As do two of McCullough’s relatives. In fact, a study from 2018 found that Pennsylvania has racked up more Lyme disease diagnoses than the next four states combined. The closer you look, the more changes you’ll find. “Spring wildflowers and trees are blooming earlier,” says Wenzel of Powdermill. “We’ve got that measured and demonstrated by our own data.” “These sorts of things are absolutely, demonstrably real,” he says. “We’re living the climate change right now.” Back at the farm, as they swat at mosquitoes, Russell and McCullough admit that they run into people who are still wary of talking about climate change. But they’ve learned the best thing you can do is connect the issue to the changes people are already seeing around them and give them access to the information they need to make up their mind for themselves. Whether it’s at the educational booth they set up at the county fair or at the hayrides, bonfires, monarch butterfly banding workshops, and archery classes hosted at Munnell Run Farm, every interaction is an opportunity not to give a lecture, but to have a conversation about where we go from here. “Spring wildflowers and trees are blooming earlier. We’ve got that measured and demonstrated by our own data. These sorts of things are absolutely, demonstrably real. We’re living the climate change right now.” – John Wenzel, director of Powdermill Nature Reserv e Adapting to the new normal doesn’t have to just be about sacrifice, says Russell. People can benefit, too. Managed forests, for instance, can both help sequester carbon and soak up precipitation, as well as provide bigger payoffs for landowners. And cover crops are also essential, says Russell. This is the practice of farmers planting standing rye, grasses, or legumes in their fields instead of leaving them barren between plantings. Such crops aren’t planted for the money they’ll fetch at the market, but for the nutrients they can fix back into the soil. Cover crops also prevent dirt and other sediment from running off into streams, so they’re environmentally valuable. A farmer may have to put a little more time and money into planting something with no immediate return, but they still benefit—just in different ways. Because they steward so much of the region’s landscape, rural communities are poised to be leaders in the push to adapt, mitigate, and change. “You don’t know what problems will be in the future,” says McCullough. “But if you can help teach people critical thinking skills, how to process something, then we can work on things together.” This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1906774.

It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building—which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That’s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International , second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of “colossal” prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. The first Carnegie International , 1896 To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii , Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture , perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today. The 1907 expansion Early Dinosaur Hall The Hall of Architecture Adding two new museums Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries , which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls : Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as “The Carnegie,” and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium , the Miniature Railroad & Village , and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its 10-year anniversary in 2001, the Science Center opened Highmark SportsWorks , the largest collection of sports and science exhibits in the world. Carnegie Science Center Three years later, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum . In addition to presenting the vast archives of Andy Warhol , the museum also has become a center for dialogue about a diverse range of topics, as well as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity through its many traveling exhibitions. The Andy Warhol Museum Today’s ever-changing experiences By the year 2000, the four Carnegie Museums became known as “Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.” The following two decades included the debut of Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s blockbuster Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibit, which is nearly three times the size of the original dinosaur hall and the first exhibit in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2003 and again in 2012, Carnegie Museum of Art accomplished its most important and most visitor-focused transformations since the opening of the Scaife wing with the reopening of its Scaife Galleries after year-long renovations, which included new presentations of its vast collections and the display of more artwork. In 2014, The Andy Warhol Museum rehung its collection, telling the story of Andy Warhol’s life and artwork chronologically for the first time to spectacular effect. In 2017, Carnegie Museums launched a collaborative event series, Carnegie Nexus , that reaches across the arts and sciences to design experiences that animate pressing issues of our time and instigate new ways to examine our world through live performance, the visual and literary arts, and thoughtful conversation. And in 2018, Carnegie Science Center completed a major expansion: PPG Science Pavilion , which houses a suite of STEM Learning Labs; a Special Exhibitions Gallery for large-scale changing exhibitions; a laser digital giant-screen theater; and outdoor learning spaces on the riverfront.

Today, it’s one of the most dynamic major art institutions in the country. Carnegie Museum of Natural History As one of the country’s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants. The museum’s millions of objects and specimens form one of the world’s great archives of biodiversity and the history of life. Carnegie Science Center Carnegie Science Center, soon to be the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center, is dedicated to inspiring learning and curiosity by connecting science and technology with everyday life. By making science both relevant and fun, the Science Center’s goal is to increase science literacy in the region and motivate young people to seek careers in science and technology. As the region’s most-visited museum, the Science Center reaches 500,000 people annually through hands-on exhibits, camps, classes, and off-site programs. The Andy Warhol Museum The most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, The Andy Warhol Museum illuminates the art, life, and times of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century. Combining artworks, images, and objects from Warhol's colorful life, the museum takes visitors on a tour of Andy Warhol's personal and professional life—from Andy Warhol the Pittsburgh art student to Andy Warhol the Pop icon. With some 500,000 artworks and objects, the museum is the global keeper of Warhol's legacy.

Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. Our Story The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections. The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. Heinz History Center As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep. Plan your visit Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions.

In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years.

    "265": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We are pleased to present this comprehensive report to the community from the promoter of Little Italy Days. Its purpose is to provide transparency regarding the history and current activities of Little Italy Days. This report, along with supporting videos will be available on www.littleitalydays.com, and accessible to any individual or organization. HISTORY Little Italy Days was started in 2002 by the Bloomfield Business Association (BBA) as a way of promoting the local businesses. Over the years the attendance at the festival grew, gaining national recognition and being awarded “Best City Event, Best State Event and Best Food Festival. The BBA went inactive in 2008, and the festival was then promoted by the Bloomfield Development Corporation (BDC) from 2009-2011. Funds were raised by the BDC and a committee of local stakeholders was involved in the planning. In June, 2012 reduced funding left the BDC with no staff, and no one to lead the organization, planning and fundraising for Little Italy Days. Faced with the possibility of cancelling the festival and realizing the negative impact it would have on the local businesses, the committee of stakeholders decided to turn the festival over to Big Day Entertainment, a local, Pittsburgh",
    "266": "the local businesses, the committee of stakeholders decided to turn the festival over to Big Day Entertainment, a local, Pittsburgh based business owned by Sal Richetti, a local businessman and experienced producer of events. Mr. Richetti was born and raised in Bloomfield, and is a stakeholder, owning property on Gross St. in Bloomfield. He had been involved in the festival since the first year, booking the entertainment through his company. Mr. Richetti has produced the festival since 2012, and has worked diligently to keep the same goal, to increase the bottom line of the local businesses. He has consistently reached out to the local community groups as partners for the event, and regularly visits the businesses on Liberty Avenue. A letter of endorsement was sent by the committee to all Bloomfield Businesses expressing their complete support of this choice. It would also ensure that Little Italy Days would be a lasting event when organized and operated by a knowledgeable event planner.

Separate from the events listed above, Little Italy Days has and can operate without closing Liberty Avenue. It is the decision of the City of Pittsburgh Public Safety to close a street and they do so only for safety purposes. Liberty Avenue is closed for only two days during the fourday festival at which time, Taylor St., Mathilda St. and Milvale Ave. are all open to cross over Liberty Avenue with crossing guards in place. This is a safer and more efficient arrangement than complete side street closures. COMMUNITY BENEFITS and OPPORTUNITIES *School fundraising – St. Maria Goretti school is aggressively fundraising to keep the school open. As written in the “Spirit of Bloomfield Magazine”, the fundraising committee is looking forward to Little Italy Days to set up booths and raise a lot of money towards their goal.

At that time Bloomfield’s business district was comprised predominately of Italian themed businesses and restaurants, and the community consisted of many Italian American residents. The goal of the festival was to bring crowds into the neighborhood",
    "279": "the community consisted of many Italian American residents. The goal of the festival was to bring crowds into the neighborhood that would shop the local businesses then and all year long. It was an Italian Festival because of Bloomfield’s long-standing identity of “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy”. Today, in 2019, the Bloomfield Business District has a large mixture of ethnic restaurants and shops. Long time Italian Restaurants such as The Pleasure Bar, Alexander’s, Donatelli’s, Sausalito, Caliente’s and Lombardozzi’s are still present, yet the remainder, which now make up the majority consist of American, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, and soon to be a Korean Restaurant. Bloomfield’s identity as Pittsburgh’s Little Italy is somewhat diluted with the addition of these various ethnic restaurants. Demographics have changed and Pittsburgh’s emergence as a high-tech city has brought in a new, diverse generation that calls Bloomfield home. Italian festivals all over the United States are faced with the challenges of securing Italian Vendors. The attendance at Little Italy Days keeps growing and the event is recognized as one of the premier events in Pittsburgh. Perhaps it’s because Little Italy Days has managed to weather the changes and embrace the diversity, while still keeping its core purpose, to",
    "280": "Little Italy Days has managed to weather the changes and embrace the diversity, while still keeping its core purpose, to promote Bloomfield and increase the bottom lines of the local businesses. As diversity has entered Bloomfield, so it must for Little Italy Days. There are many others who live in and visit the community that are not of Italian Heritage but still enjoy the music, food, diversity of restaurants, and overall atmosphere. The non-Italian vendors do very well, as do the nonItalian local businesses, showing that there is a market for alternatives. Because the event is free, many families attend the event with children, and they want different food choices such as French fries and nachos. Others attend for the world class entertainment, whether it’s Italian or not. Many of these would not attend, and the festival would not continue to survive if these options were not available. Little Italy Days continues to remember the roots of the community as displayed in the “Welcome to Bloomfield, Pittsburgh’s Little Italy Sign”, while following the progression of the business district and embracing the diversity. The festival still has a large Italian representation and includes many Italian Vendors, Italian Bocce Tournament (24 Teams),",
    "281": "the diversity. The festival still has a large Italian representation and includes many Italian Vendors, Italian Bocce Tournament (24 Teams), an Italian Mass and Procession, three stages of Italian Themed Entertainment, Little Miss Italy Contest, Italian Cooking Shows, Italian Dance Groups, Italian Idol Singing Competition, Italian Music and Opera, Italian Wine and Cooking Demonstrations, as well as an abundance of Italian Foods, Desserts, Italian T Shirts, Trinkets, and Crafts. The bocce tournament is a huge draw with the Italian Team, led by Mayor Peduto playing against the Irish Team, led by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. There are many other local media and sports celebrities who attend this tournament. Our surveys and interviews with Liberty Avenue businesses prove that Little Italy Days still significantly increases the revenue for most of the local businesses over the four-day period like no other time of the year. We do recognize that certain businesses choose to close, and many of them do for other events including the Halloween Parade, the Columbus Day Parade and the Pittsburgh Marathon. This is not interpreted as negative to the festival, as there are other reasons for closing such as lack of staffing, vacation, family commitments or renovations. The following",

Oriental Massage was giving free neck massages and specials for the weekend. These are examples of what all businesses can do during the festival to get more customers.

    "285": "effort and fundraiser such a success! If the reasoning is that Little Italy Days should only offer Italian Vendors, then property owners in the business district should only rent their buildings to Italian Themed Businesses. It’s no different from a businessman producing a festival. Liberty Avenue property owners are businessmen that profit from their tenants with no accountability to the community. Decrepit buildings like the laundromat at Pearl St., businesses such as Ace Check Cashing, and 13 vacancies on Liberty Avenue are examples of this. Along Liberty Avenue, the tree beds are overgrown and littered with garbage that Little Italy Days staff, not local stakeholders, cleaned and mulched on Sunday before the festival. Residents and community groups should press to have these building owners maintain and clean up their property all year long and force a community process for this purpose as well. The Little Italy Days team welcomes a community process and is always listening to concerns. CORPORATE VENDORS These types of vendors are at every festival, solely to offset the costs of producing the festival. Sponsorships are more difficult to get as boards, managers and the economic climate changes. Additionally, costs to produce an event with three stages",
    "286": "difficult to get as boards, managers and the economic climate changes. Additionally, costs to produce an event with three stages of entertainment, (30 acts), permits, tents, tables, chairs, sound systems, paramedics, advertising, promotion, crossing guards, insurance, signage, labor, clean-up, dumpsters, porta-johns, barricades, police, shuttle buses and overnight security continue to rise. MAKING THE EVENT SMALLER From 2002 to 2011, Little Italy Days was operated by the local non-profit community groups, first the Bloomfield Business Association, then the Bloomfield Development Corporation. In its early years, all the organizers were business owners and would work around the clock to manage the festival. There was very little support from the local businesses with organization or fundraising. Through the community group, money was raised from grants and fundraising, but the costs increased every year. Even with many volunteers, it was a challenge to break even. Business owners and community groups do not have time, staff or knowledge to produce or finance the festival. It is a huge project that takes many months to plan and requires a staff of over 75 workers. Additionally, Lou’s Bar on Gross Street and Froggy’s on Taylor Street which are at the start and the end of the festival",
    "287": "Bar on Gross Street and Froggy’s on Taylor Street which are at the start and the end of the festival footprint, benefit greatly from the two extra stages. All Bloomfield businesses in between benefit from the vendors needed to keep the flow of festival attendees to these areas. The current area has been the same footprint since 2014. CONCLUSION Over 100,000 people attended the festival and enjoyed it immensely. Many people who grew up in Bloomfield return during Little Italy Days for family reunions. We received an enormous amount of positive feedback from businesses and residents and will continue to listen to the community and produce a safe, family friendly festival that promotes Bloomfield and significantly increases revenue for the local businesses. We feel that no other event does this as diligently as Little Italy Days. PLANS AND IDEAS FOR 2020 *Update and rebrand by adding a slogan to the event name: Little Italy Days - Celebrating our roots and promoting Bloomfield Businesses. *Encourage vendors to give discounts to Bloomfield residents for their products and services *Italian Flags on all the vendor tents and the three stages *Making the main stage on Cedarville exclusively all acts Italian. *Producer is in",
