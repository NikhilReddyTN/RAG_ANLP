In 1984, Terregator—the “world’s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot”—was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world’s first university-wide computer network and file system.\nThis growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country.\nBy the decade’s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined.\nLearn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s",
