Downtown Church of the Epiphany The Church of the Epiphany, a Roman Catholic church designed in 1902 by architect Edward Stotz, was designed in the form of an Italian Romanesque basilica, and built of redbrick with terra cotta trim. The interior decoration, which includes frescoes, was designed by John Comes, a principal designer of Catholic churches in the Pittsburgh area at the time. The church is the center of a complex of four buildings, including a parish house (1902), a school (1910), and the St. Regis Residence (1914). First Lutheran Church Designed by architect Andrew Peebles in 1887-88 and begun while the Allegheny County Courthouse was being completed, the Romanesque style First Lutheran Church reflects the design of the Courthouse with its rusticated stonework and vermilion-tinted mortar. The exterior is dominated by tall gabled roofs and a spire that rises 170 feet. The plan of the church is in the form of a Greek cross, which gives it a centralized character. The white plaster walls are broken with three tall windows; the window in the north transept (\"The Good Shepherd\") was designed by Frederick Wilson and fabricated by the Tiffany Studios in 1898. The altar, which was installed after 1892, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style, with mosaics. First Presbyterian Church Designed in 1903-1905 by architect Theophilus P. Chandler, the First Presbyterian Church stands on land that was donated to the church in 1787 by the Penn family for religious purposes. The church structure was designed by a Philadelphia architect who ended up designing three Presbyterian churches in Pittsburgh. The exterior design is in the English Gothic style, and its twin-towered facade is reminiscent of Gothic cathedral design. The interior was laid out as a single large rectangular space, with the pulpit at one end and galleries raised along the sides. In this way, the architecture emphasizes the preaching function of the service. There are no full-height piers in the space because the roof is carried on two massive arched wooden trusses that span the length of the church, above the fronts of the galleries. These structurally-daring trusses are encased in elaborately carved woodwork. The ceiling between the arches is borne on hammer truss beams. The curved paneled wall behind the stone pulpit opens to reveal a rear wing that is lined with three levels of Sunday-school classrooms. The rough stone walls on the interior are opened up by significant stained-glass windows. All of the nave windows, except one, were designed and produced by the Tiffany Studios in New York. The large east window, in the Sunday-school wing, is the work of Clayton & Bell, of London, and depicts a \"Jesse Tree\", or genealogy of Christ. The \"west\" window, in the facade of the church, was designed and built by William Willett of Boston. Smithfield United Church This Gothic-style building was designed and built in 1925-26 by one of Pittsburgh's premiere Classical architects, Henry Hornbostel. The mass of the building culminates in a square tower that is capped by an openwork aluminum spire, an early architectural use of aluminum. The Gothic ornament on the exterior is a surface treatment, limited to the exterior stone panels attached to the steel structural frame. The tall, relatively narrow sanctuary at the top of the building is focused on the 18-foot-diameter rose window. The side walls are lined with tall stained-glass windows that depict both the life and teachings of Christ, and the history of this congregation and of the city of Pittsburgh. The interior ornament, like the exterior, is surface ornament dominated by Gothic arches, with plaster fan and groin vaults in the ceiling. St. Mary of Mercy Roman Catholic Church St. Mary's is the newest and smallest of the churches in Downtown Pittsburgh. The church was designed by architect William P. Hutchins in 1936, and stands out by contrast with its neighbors, in its size and its red brick exterior, with Gothic details in stone. St. Mary's has been built out at the sidewalk line, with its entrance located under a simple square tower at its corner. The principal aisle inside the church follows the diagonal axis of the entry toward the altar. The interior is relatively plain and auditorium-like: a modern church interior built before the Second Vatican Council. Trinity Cathedral Designed by architect Gordon Lloyd in1870-71, the church's parish house was designed in 1907 by Crocker & Carpenter. The exterior was designed in the Early Decorated English Gothic Style that was favored by mid-Victorian Episcopalians, with a single central steeple and side transepts. The interior features a tall nave flanked by aisles and lit by clerestory windows. The plaster nave walls are supported by clustered stone columns, and the austere interior ornamentation, in which the pointed arch predominates, is reminiscent of the work of the American Gothicist Richard Upjohn. Some of the stained glass windows in the nave were destroyed in a fire in 1967, and were replaced by new ones in a medieval style. The rest of the windows date from 1872. The carved stone pulpit was built in 1922 to the design of the renowned American architect Bertram G. Goodhue. North Shore Calvary United Methodist Church An historic landmark in one of Pittsburgh's most charming neighborhoods, the Calvary Church is a stunning example of European-inspired architecture and features three magnificently restored, 30-foot Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows. Other features include delicate spires and friendly gargoyles, an elegant wooden ceiling, stunning decoration, and historic Farrand & Votey pipe organ. Emmanuel Episcopal Church Completed in 1886, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also on the North Side, is a classic example of the work of Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is built on property acquired in 1882 from Macher Warfield -- a cousin of Wallis Warfield, later the Duchess of Windsor. The church's decor includes a \"reredos\" an impressive ornamental screen behind the altar featuring stained glass angels, mosaics and marble statues. Oakland Heinz Memorial Chapel It is a place where people find serenity and discover the joy of celebration. Crafted of limestone and solid oak, this Neo-Gothic masterwork instantly captivates in a panorama of vaulted ceilings, soaring arches, and more than 250,000 individual pieces of exquisite stained glass. For over a century, Heinz Memorial Chapel has been the Pittsburgh destination for dream weddings, special concerts, guided tours and quiet reflection. Saint Paul's Cathedral Saint Paul's Cathedral was opened in 1906 at its present site on Fifth Avenue in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Designed by Egan and Prindeville of Chicago and built by Thomas Reilly, a general contractor from Philadelphia, Saint Paul's is an example of the Scholastic, or Decorated, Gothic style of the 14th Century. The building rises 247 feet with a statue of Saint Paul mounted on the center pediment. Other exterior statues depict the apostles and evangelists of the Eastern and Western Church. While the overall proportions of the structure are not true to the classic cathedrals of Europe, Saint Paul Cathedral fits the site and (as the cathedrals of old) reflects their spirit and historical significance.

There are multiple theaters and so much history to be seen at each one. Benedum Center for the Performing Arts Pittsburgh''s 2,885 seat Benedum Center is the result of a $42 million restoration and expansion of the Stanley Theatre, built in 1928 as \"a movie palace version of Versailles.\" This one-time vaudeville hall has been renovated with grand style. Every detail-from the 500,000-piece crystal chandelier to the gilded plasterwork-has been restored or replicated and after its two-year renovation, it looks as it did on opening night in 1928. The signature piece of the Benedum Center, the original main chandelier, weighs 4,700 pounds and measures 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The Grand Lobby mirrors, marble and woodwork are all original, and at the landing on each staircase in the Grand Lobby are 18-foot high original mirrors meant to be reminiscent of the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Byham Theater Originally built in 1903 as the Gayety Theater, the Byham Theater opened on Halloween night, 1904. It ran for many years as one of the country''s foremost stage and vaudeville houses, with appearances from such stars as Ethel Barrymore, Gertrude Lawrence and Helen Hayes. In the 1930s, the theater was renamed The Fulton and became a full-time movie theater. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust purchased the theater in 1990 and following the first of four planned phases of renovation, the Fulton was reopened in May 1991. It was later renamed the Byham Theater through a naming gift from the Byham family following the second phase of renovation in 1995. The Gayety boasted pressed copper cherubs painted with a bronze patina, imitation gold leaf, stained glass windows, plaster columns and wainscot of scagolia, an Italian faux marble technique. In the entry vestibule, note the original mosaic tile floor and the many bare light bulbs lining the ceiling, evidence of the advent of electrical lighting. The old lighted Fulton marquee was restored by the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. The second phase of renovations brought new restrooms, box office, marquee, an elevator, lobby improvements and facade changes. In 1997, the Cherub Lobby was restored to its original splendor. Heinz Hall This restored 1926 movie theater's architecture now serves as the backdrop for much of Pittsburgh's cultural activity. It's the crown jewel of venues in Pittsburgh's Cultural District and has an international reputation for grandeur and excellence as a concert hall and showplace. The 2,661-seat world-class venue is home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which performs 30 concerts in the Hall annually. Despite several renovations over the years, much of the basic architecture of the building has remained unchanged from its original French Court style. In the Hall's beautiful lobby, ornate Italian marble shines and baroque relief, shimmering crystal lights and exquisite chandeliers provide the allure for an evening of stage and show. Breche opal and Lavanto marble, plush red velvet and shimmering crystal are the main elements in the decoration of the interior of the Hall and 24-karat gold leaf detailing is seen throughout. O'Reilly Theater The O'Reilly is the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's only newly constructed theater. It was created with two purposes: to create a Downtown home for the Pittsburgh Public Theater and add an additional venue for theater, music and other performances. Designed by world-renowned architect Michael Graves, the O'Reilly Theater is the only downtown performance venue that features a thrust stage, surrounded by the audience on three sides. Its aesthetic is signature Graves-smooth, polished, pared-down and classic. The theater's wood is all curly maple, with the sensuous grain producing the primary decorative effect. Built at a cost of $25 million, the 650-seat capacity, state-of-the-art theater officially opened in December of 1999.

Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit. Downtown Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle. BNY Mellon Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away. Fort Pitt Block House The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet. Frick Building The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919. Fifth Avenue Place Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter. Gulf Tower Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline, the Gulf Tower beacon glows different colors according to weather conditions. Built as the headquarters for the Gulf Oil Company, the structure was completed in 1932. The crown of the skyscraper is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in the style of the step pyramid. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 1973. K&L Gates Center K&L Gates Center is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of downtown Pittsburgh. The building, long known as One Oliver Plaza and briefly as FreeMarkets Center and Ariba Center, was completed in 1968, has 39 floors and rises 511 feet above downtown Pittsburgh. Omni William Penn Hotel Built in 1916, this grand hotel boasts a history as one of the architectural centerpieces in downtown Pittsburgh. Unique features include the historic filigreed arches cradling the main lobby space, elegant lanterns that once again grace the sidewalk. Enlarged in 1929 by architect Benno Janssen and his partners, the hotel lobby has Old World elegance, with its potted palms, crystal chandeliers and classical music. The hotel's finest room, however, is on the 17th floor -- the Art Deco ballroom designed by New York architect Joseph Urban. The hotel is the last of four buildings in three adjacent blocks commissioned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who sometimes reserved the Presidential suite for his own use. Oxford Centre One Oxford Centre is actually a complex of six buildings, all of matching glass and steel design. Completed in 1983, One Oxford Centre has 46 floors in its main tower and rises 615 feet about Downtown. The tower has nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and high-end retail space. At night, 43 spotlights illuminate the Centre with a total of 55,000 watts that create a glowing effect said to be greater than any other high-rise in the U.S. The building is designed the way it is, with so many sides, because the developers wanted as many corner offices in it as possible. PNC/Fairmont Tower Headquartered in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group is one of the nation's largest financial services companies. Three PNC/Fairmont is a 23-story skyscraper and is one of the nation's largest mixed-use LEED-certified green buildings. It's also the site of one of the largest \"living walls\" in North America. Included is the green 185-room Fairmont Pittsburgh Hotel, as well as 28 luxury condos. The company is at work on The Tower at PNC Plaza, which is expected to be the world's largest green high-rise. PPG Place Beautiful PPG Place is the headquarters for PPG Industries, Inc. and perhaps the most distinctive building in Pittsburgh's picturesque skyline. PPG Place, a large building complex including a 40-story tower (635 feet) with five satellite buildings that cover a six city block area, was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. The large urban complex was in part inspired by two existing architectural landmarks in Pittsburgh, the Cathedral of Learning in the University of Pittsburgh's campus and H.H. Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse. In PPG Place, Johnson made loose use of Gothic architectural vocabulary, translating it into modern materials and construction techniques. PPG Place stands perhaps as one of Johnson's buildings that best demonstrate his wit and affinity for mixed messages. By mixing historical forms with modern methods of construction, Johnson created a post-modernist building which is truly unique, in part due to its use of materials, which were immensely appropriate since PPG is a leading manufacturer of curtain wall assemblies. Union Trust Building Formerly known as the Union Arcade (1915-1917). The architect of this Flemish Gothic fantasy was Pittsburgher Frederick J. Osterling, who had enlarged Frick's Point Breeze home two decades earlier. It is Frick's answer to the then-new Woolworth Building in New York City, the world's tallest. When it opened, it was Pittsburgh's most sumptuous shopping mall, although its four floors of shops have been reduced to one. Step inside, walk to the center and look up into the delicate lace of the stained glass dome. U.S. Steel Tower Designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, the world headquarters of the U.S. Steel Corporation was completed in 1971. During the initial planning stages, the U.S. Steel Corporation seriously considered making this development the world's tallest building. The tower's shape, mirroring the shape of Downtown Pittsburgh, is a triangle with indented corners. It was the first building to use liquid-fireproofed columns. At the time of its completion this was the world's tallest building outside of New York and Chicago, and is still the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 64 stories. When its construction was completed in 1971, the building was considered to be an engineering masterpiece. The Tower is home to the global headquarters for both the U.S. Steel Corporation and UPMC, a leader in innovative health care practices and a health insurance provider. Mt. Washington Chatham Village Built in the early 1930s, Chatham Village is a model planned community with rowhouses, garden courts, greenbelt and recreation facilities opened through the Buhl Foundation to promote social reforms and housing improvements for middle-income families. This influenced the development of 20th century urban planning in the US. Oakland Cathedral of Learning The Cathedral of Learning is the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in Oakland. Standing at 535 feet, the 42-story Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere and the second tallest in the world. The Cathedral was commissioned in 1921 and finished in 1937, and has 2,529 windows. Nationality Rooms The first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning are home to 29 Nationality Rooms. As gifts to the University of Pittsburgh from the city's ethnic communities, these 30 unique classrooms take you on a voyage of world cultures and global traditions. Witness designs that range from Byzantine and Classical to Renaissance and Romanesque. Step inside Beijing, Damascus, Athens and more to hear each room's unique story without having set foot outside Pittsburgh.

Fallingwater Called \"The best all-time work of American architecture\" by the American Institute of Architects, and named one of \"50 Places of a Lifetime\" by National Geographic, Fallingwater is located 90 minutes south of Pittsburgh in the idyllic Laurel Highlands. The house is dramatically cantilevered over a waterfall and widely considered to be Wright's most sublime integration of man and nature. Fallingwater is open daily, except for Wednesday, mid-March through November. In-depth, self-guided grounds and children's tours available. Advanced ticket purchase or reservations are essential. Share Your Story On Social #LOVEPGH Duncan House Wright-designed Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort is nestled deep in the heart of the Laurel Highlands in Acme, Pa., about 90 minutes from Pittsburgh. It is one of only four Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the U.S. that offers overnight lodging. The house's floor plan includes Wright's trademark open living/dining area with a natural stone fireplace as its focal point. Recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry and geometric styling are obvious throughout the home. Natural colors and fabrics are used to reflect Wright's dedication to the preservation of nature and its integration with indoor spaces. Polymath Park Resort is situated on more than 100 tranquil and scenic wooded acres including miles of hiking trails and a peaceful reflecting pond. The Duncan House Polymath Park Resort is just 15 miles from Fallingwater and 30 miles from Kentuck Knob. The resort also includes the Balter and Blum Houses, built for Pittsburgh industrialists by Wright apprentice Peter Berndtson. Kentuck Knob Two-thousand glorious feet above the Youghiogheny River sits yet another Frank Lloyd Wright masterwork. Settled in the crest of the hill-this culmination of organic architecture and elegant living space makes the home appear as if it were one with the mountain. Tidewater red cypress and native fieldstone are its core elements. A completely functional kitchen is central to the foundations architectural design, while stonewalls anchor this privately owned residence. The rest of the open floor plan utilizes cantilevered overhangs and a great expanse of glass that make you feel as though you're one with nature. A large outdoor sculpture garden is also present on the grounds. M√§ntyl√§ House The newest addition to the Frank Lloyd Wright collection in the Laurel Highlands is the M√§ntyl√§ House in Polymouth Park. M√§ntyl√§, meaning \"of the pines,\" was designed by Wright in 1952 and features dramatic angles and, of course, an homage to nature. Visitors are welcomed to experience a guided tour of the house during the day, or plan a trip to stay overnight, March through December. Specialized tours include the opportunity to dine inside the home at a Wright-designed table or to enjoy breakfast and a tour in the morning hours when the house's unique structure shines bright.

After the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) launched its LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) green building rating system in 1998, three of the first 13 buildings to receive LEED certification were in Greater Pittsburgh. Since then, the city has consistently ranked high for its number of LEED and other certified green buildings. Pittsburgh is home to many green building firsts, including:First LEED Food Bank ‚Äì Greater Pittsburgh Food BankFirst LEED Financial Institution ‚Äì PNC Firstside CenterFirst LEED Convention Center ‚Äì David L. Lawrence Convention CenterFirst LEED University Dormitory ‚Äì Carnegie Mellon University Stever HouseFirst LEED Public Arts Facility ‚Äì Pittsburgh Glass CenterFirst LEED Welcome Center in a Public Garden ‚Äì Phipps Conservatory Welcome CenterFirst LEED Smithsonian Property ‚Äì Senator John Heinz History CenterFirst LEED Radio Station ‚Äì WYEP Radio StationFirst LEED University Dance Studio ‚Äì Point Park University Dance Complex Visit the Green Building Alliance for more information on Pittsburgh's green building initiatives and practices. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens In 2020, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens' complex of sustainable buildings was awarded a Governor‚Äôs Award for Environmental Excellence from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Phipps‚Äô sustainable efforts have reached a new level of excellence with the construction of three of the greenest buildings in the world on its campus: the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL, opened in 2012) which is also the only building in the world to achieve five of the highest certifications for green construction (Living Building Challenge, LEED Platinum, WELL Platinum, SITES Platinum and BREEAM Outstanding in Use); the Nature Lab at Phipps (2015); and the Exhibit Staging Center (ESC, 2019). Pending the ESC‚Äôs successful completion of the Living Building Challenge‚Äôs year-long performance period, Phipps will have three Living Future Institute-certified buildings on a single site, each representing a unique use and construction type ‚Äî new, modular and adaptive reuse ‚Äî and demonstrating the potential of integrated, regenerative design. To learn more about Phipps commitment to human and environmental health through buildings, operations, programs and research, visit phipps.conservatory.org/green-innovation. David L. Lawrence Convention Center The David L. Lawrence Convention Center is a significant symbol of the \"new\" Pittsburgh Region. As Pittsburgh continues to revolutionize into a regional destination place, this landmark building has become the cornerstone of the transformation. On the cutting edge of design, this innovative structure connects the urban city to the waterfront overlooking the Allegheny River. The Convention Center boasts breath-taking views of the North Shore and Downtown Pittsburgh from the concourses, balconies and terraces, and is the only convention center in the world with LEED¬Æ (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certifications of GOLD in new construction and PLATINUM in existing building, by the U.S. Green Building Council. As the first \"green\" convention center and world's largest \"green\" building, the Center capitalized on its environmentally smart structure by utilizing natural daylight and natural ventilation to light and heat the building, and incorporating a water reclamation system which reduces potable water use. Stretching across the convention center's swooping roofline are 688 feet of blue light-emitting diode (LED) tubes. Jenny Holzer created this kinetic display titled For Pittsburgh to present important books that tell compelling stories about Pittsburgh, including Thomas Bell's Out of This Furnace; John Edgar Wideman's Homewood Trilogy, Damballah, Hiding Place, and Sent for You Yesterday; and Annie Dillard's An American Childhood. The texts scroll 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For Pittsburgh is the artist's largest LED project in the United States. Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center's PPG Science Pavilion The new expansion to the Science Center opened in June 2018 and is a 48,000-square-foot space that ushers in a new era of enhanced STEM programs, state-of-the-art exhibits, and public exploration of science and technology at the North Shore destination. The building is LEED Gold certified by the United States Green Building Council. This means the U.S. Green Building Council has recognized that PPG Science Pavilion is a healthy, highly efficient, and cost-saving green building. The building is coated with multiple PPG products, including PPG PAINTS‚Ñ¢ SPEEDHIDE¬Æ interior paint, MEGASEAL‚Ñ¢ epoxy by PPG, and more. Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center's PPG Science Pavilion serves as an example of sustainable building practices. PPG Paints Arena The home of National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins is the first LEED¬Æ Gold certified major sports venue in the country. The venue seats 18,087 people in honor of team captain Sidney Crosby's No. 87. The Center uses 40% less water consumption by volume and thanks in part to natural lighting and high-efficiency ventilation, boasts a 31% reduction in energy consumption. Children's Museum of Pittsburgh The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh is an architectural masterpiece. In 2006, the Children's Museum received the Silver LEED¬Æ certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, making it the largest Silver LEED-certified museum in the country. The Museum also received the 2006 American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture. Design Architect Koning Eizenberg Architecture of Santa Monica, California and Executive Architect Perkins Eastman of Pittsburgh received this honor for excellence in architecture-considered the highest recognition of works in the field-for the Museum's 2004 expansion. PNC Firstside Center This five-story Silver LEED¬Æ certified building establishes PNC as a corporate leader in green building. An innovative hybrid system of air distribution improves energy efficiency, comfort and maintenance. The system includes a raised floor, that also makes the workspace flexible to reconfigure. The daylit interiors afford 90% of the occupants with an outdoor view. The urban infill site is adjacent to a bike trail and a light rail transit stop and has helped to revitalize the Downtown area. Energy Innovation Center This 200,000 square foot building is located in the Lower Hill District and houses a not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting clean and sustainable energy. Built in 1930, the Energy Innovation Center (EIC) has LEED Platinum certification and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well as the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation's list of Historic Landmarks. Originally the Connelley Trade School, the building was redesigned according to the standards of sustainability and energy efficiency while maintaining its historic elements. It is now a home for workforce development programs, green technology research laboratories, and other community projects, such as the Penn State Center's creation of tree wells for stormwater management. Utilizing energy efficient techniques such as ice storage for cooling and an automatic zone control system which reduces energy consumption, the EIC is emerging as a leader in technological innovation.

Introduction to Pittsburgh Easily navigable waterways with an abundance of natural resources, (coal, timber, natural gas, iron and limestone) helped Pittsburgh become the industrial center for a growing nation. Most people recognize one thing about Pittsburgh's history, that it was known as an industrial hub for coal mining and steel production. Pittsburgh has played an important part in U.S. history from the early days of the French and Indian War (1758), to the Revolutionary War (1776), to the infamous Whiskey Rebellion (1791) and the American Civil War (1860s) with its secretive Underground Railroad stops. The Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand. With his introduction of the Bessemer steel making process, Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie, completed his rise from obscurity to become the richest man in the world. Carnegie began steel production in 1875. Henry Clay Frick, grandson of western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers, made his fortune building and operating beehive coking ovens where coal was turned into coke, a necessary raw material in steel making. Soon, the two men came together to form the Carnegie Steel Co. In 1901, Carnegie and Frick merged several companies into United States Steel Corp. The history of America's labor union movement added some dark days during the Homestead Steel Strike and subsequent armed conflict of the Battle of Homestead. From these dark days, though, grew modern labor practices and laws to protect workers. While the riverfront steel mills of the Mon Valley are mostly gone now, the generosity of industrial giants like Carnegie and Frick, food manufacturer H.J. Heinz, and banker/financier Andrew Mellon lives on in a legacy of art, culture and education in Pittsburgh. What remained are the Frick family home, known as Clayton, as well as a masterful art collection. Andrew Carnegie's generous public donations included The Carnegie Library, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Institute of Technology (known today as Carnegie Mellon University). Up through the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for nearly half of national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a half million with European immigration via Ellis Island. Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retains an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history. Even though Pittsburgh faced rough times in the 1970s and 80s when steel production all but disappeared from its landscape, it has since re-invented itself as a hub for education, medicine, small manufacturing and research. Of course, having extremely successful sports teams has enhanced the city's reputation. The black and gold of all three of its professional teams, Steelers (NFL), Pirates (MLB) and Penguins (NHL) are synonymous with the pride local residents have in its sports teams and the city they represent. Today Pittsburgh welcomes visitors from around the globe. Its strengths lie in its authenticity as an all-American city, and its genuine, hard-working and welcoming sense of community that has transformed it into one of the most surprisingly beautiful and progressive cities in the USA.

It was broad in its reach, encompassing the United States and beyond, and profound in its meaning for a nation entwined in the sale of human life. Yet, that history, by its very secretive nature, is a difficult one to reveal. What was the Underground Railroad? Western Pennsylvania was a major thoroughfare for enslaved peoples seeking freedom. They followed routes that were carved by nature in rivers, streams and mountains, traveling mostly on foot, with an occasional ride in hidden compartments of wagons and other forms of transportation. Their numbers are not certain as formal records were not kept and few informal ones remain. Some documents written by those who assisted‚Äîsometimes referred to as the \"conductors\"‚Äîin this underground process have survived, giving some indication of what those traveling on the railroad endured. Some publications written by, or for, those who managed to survive to secure their freedom also exist. Free people of African decent who lived in the area were also affected by the Fugitive Slave Laws, fleeing their homes as they faced the possibility of becoming enslaved. Still others became the voice of social change and self-empowerment for all Blacks of the era and beyond. The history is unique and boundless. Explore more than 250 years of African-American history in the Senator John Heinz History Center's exhibition, From Slavery to Freedom, which highlights the history of the anti-slavery movement, the Underground Railroad and the impact of 19th-centurty activism on the quest for civil rights in Pittsburgh. One of the many Underground Railroad routes in western Pennsylvania came in through Uniontown in Fayette County, then traveled through Blairsville in Indiana County before continuing into Mercer, Venango and Erie Counties. The Blairsville Area Underground Railroad Project provides tours of the town and cemetery and UGRR-related sites, including the Underground Railroad Museum. Western Pennsylvania Underground Railroad Sites Bigham House on Mt. Washington Chatham VillageOlympia RoadMt. Washington, PA 15211 Built in 1849, a stop on the Underground Railroad, located within Chatham Village. Thomas James Bigham was an abolitionist lawyer and the editor of The Commercial Journal Anti-Slavery Newspaper. Tradition states that Bigham's Black family nurse, Lucinda, faithfully watched from the tower of the Bigham home for fugitive slaves or professional slave hunters. Not a visitor attraction, but available for group tours upon request. Learn more from wesa.fm story. City Baths Barbershop and safehouse located on Third Street between Market and Ferry Streets in downtown Pittsburgh. Slaves received a new appearance and a start on their escape to Canada. Historians have compared lists of prominent hotel guests with ads placed by people looking for escaped slaves to confirm the hotel's place in abolitionist history. By day, a business, social and political club for the city's white leaders, by night, a station on the Underground Railroad. Freedom Road Cemetery Mercer County Historical Society119 South Pitt St.Mercer, PA 16137724.662.3490 This cemetery is located on the right across from the main gate at Stoneboro Fairgrounds. The cemetery is all that remains of Liberia, a fugitive slave town established by the Travis family, free Blacks. For years, this community offered sanctuary to weary travelers. It was also the site of frequent raids by slave catchers. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1849/50, most of the population fled to Canada to become legal free citizens. A few stayed in this area, one an entrepreneur who sold cigars and whiskey to his neighbors. Gibson House (Mark Twain Manor) Jamestown Future Foundation210 Liberty St.Jamestown, PA 16134724.932.5455 Dr. William Gibson, a prominent Jamestown physician, traveled with Samuel Clemens to Russia. Clemens wrote a book on their travels called Innocents Abroad. The house has been rumored to be a stop on the Underground Railroad. In the basement, there is evidence of a small room used in the Underground Railroad. There is now a restaurant in this building. The Gibson House is on the National Register of Historic Places. John C. Peck Oyster House Fourth Street between Wood and Market, downtown Pittsburgh An Underground Railroad station stop. Plaque Honoring Jane Gray Swisshelm 600 Grant St., downtown Pittsburgh Located at the Heinz headquarters on Sixth Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh. Jane Grey Swisshelm witnessed slavery firsthand and became dedicated to the abolition movement for the Underground Railroad. Her abolitionist weekly, the Pittsburgh Saturday Visitor, first appeared in 1848. Private homes in Arthurville and Hayti Lower Hill District, Pittsburgh Fugitives were secreted in private homes in the predominantly Black section of Arthurville and Hayti and were aided by agents and conductors including the Rev. Lewis Woodson, Samuel Bruce, George Gardner and Bishop Benjamin Tanner, the father of the noted black artist Henry Ossawa Tanner, who is portrayed on a U.S. postage stamp. St. Matthew's A.M.E. Church in Sewickley 345 Thorn St., Sewickley Built in 1857 in Sewickley, served as operators on the Underground Railroad. One frequently-used method for delivering food to fugitive slaves in the Pittsburgh area was for conductors to dress as hunters at night with a game bag filled with provisions. Wylie A.M.E. Church 2200 Wylie Ave., Hill District July 11, 1850, a group of African American citizens met at the church and passed resolutions condemning the recently proposed Fugitive Slave Bill. Members of this gathering called for total consolidation of their associations to ensure protection from slave catchers coming into Pittsburgh seeking fugitives. Demolished Sites Allegheny Institute and Mission Church Later known as Avery College, then as Avery Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church at Nash and Avery Streets. Charles A. Avery came to Pittsburgh in 1812. His interest in the cotton industry took him on buying trips to the South, and he was drawn to the plight of the Negro slaves. Joining the abolitionist forces, he aided the escape of slaves from the South to Canada in the underground railroad. The Allegheny Institute and Mission Church, later known as Avery College, built with funds from Mr. Avery's fortune, was a three-story structure heavily influenced by the Greek Revival architecture being used in many eastern cities at that time. The basement, accessible by hidden trap doors, was most probably a \"station\" (hiding place) in the secret Underground Railroad. A tunnel from the church's basement led to a former canal nearby, permitting fugitive slaves to be dropped by boat from the Allegheny River. A rowboat was used to secretly move them up the canal at night to the tunnel entrance. The first and second floors were used for education, and the third floor for religious purposes. When Avery died, his fortune was estimated at $800,000. Among the bequests was $20,000 for Oberlin College, the first college in the United States to admit Blacks. Workmen demolished the red brick building of Avery College in Old Allegheny's Dutchtown to make way for the much disputed highway through the East Street Valley. Outside of a few sentimental old-timers, nobody noticed the demolition of the old structure. But to the old-timers, the passing of the building meant the end of a prominent Pittsburgher's dream. Crawford Grill A center of Black social life, located in the Hill District, where musicians such as Art Blakey, Mary Lou Williams and John Coltrane drew a racially mixed, international clientele. Owned by William \"Gus\" Greenlee, a powerful figure in politics and sports in Pittsburgh's Black community, who owned the Pittsburgh Crawfords, the city's Negro League baseball team. Monongahela House Demolished hotel, once located at the corner of Water and Smithfield Streets. One of the city's finest hotels and a center of anti-slavery activity. Its staff included 300 free Blacks that had daily contact with a flow of wealthy Southern businessmen who came north and east. Point View Hotel Family-owned historic bar and restaurant on Brownsville Road in Brentwood, that once served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Runaway slaves stayed in the basement.

From its beginning in the early 1800s, the town benefited from road, canal and railroad traffic. Many of the people who settled in the area had strict religious convictions and they became a strong force in the Underground Railroad movement.In those days, the bounty hunters tracking the freedom seekers often made comments about how swiftly the runaways moved and were able to disappear. It was almost as if they had an underground railroad. The various methods used by abolitionists to hide and move the freedom seekers made their pursuers is now referred to as the Underground Railroad.Records were seldom kept due to the severe fines and threats of jail terms that accompanied anyone found guilty of breaking the law. At that time, the law forbid aiding and abetting any slave trying to reach freedom in Canada.We celebrate the brave freedom seeker who traveled through Indiana County, beginning in Blairsville and moving northward, one hiding place at a time‚Ä¶ Explore Blairsville‚Äôs History with this self-guided tour.

Pittsburgh's Underground Railroad history sheds light on city's 'militant abolitionist community' 90.5 WESA | By Kathleen J. Davis Published June 6, 2019 at 5:58 AM EDT Facebook LinkedIn Email Listen ‚Ä¢ 4:45 Kathleen J. Davis / 90.5 WESAThe side of the Mount Washington estate formerly known as the Bigham House. The small windows up top are where a secret top floor is. Atop Mount Washington, in the sprawling Chatham Village community, is a large brick home with large windows and spacious balconies. Chatham Village resident, architect and amateur historian David Vater said it used to be known as the Bigham House, and was the residence of abolishionist lawyer Thomas Bigham. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad. Credit Kathleen J. Davis / 90.5 WESA / 90.5 WESAThe front door of Chatham Hall, formerly known as the Bigham House. It was the home of abolitionist lawyer Thomas Bigham and a stop on the Underground Railroad. \"This building sat all by itself out in this large open woods ... on the top of the hill,\" Vater said. \"[That] made it sort of an ideal place to seclude the slaves, and they could see anyone approaching the house for miles around.\"Legendary lore has developed around the Underground Railroad. While not actually a train route underground, it was a way for slaves to escape servitude, often by heading to Canada.WESA listener Cynthia Bell of Highland Park asked a Good Question about this period in history.\"I was wondering what the Underground Railroad stops were in Pittsburgh,\" Bell asked.There are five confirmed spots within Pittsburgh city limits, said Samuel Black, director of African American programs at the Heinz History Center. He helped create the exhibit \"From Slavery to Freedom,\" which includes information about the people and places that were in helping enslaved people find freedom during the middle of the 19th century. Credit Kathleen J. Davis / 90.5 WESA / 90.5 WESAThe \"From Slavery to Freedom\" exhibit at the Heinz History Center. \"Pittsburgh had a rather militant abolitionist community,\" Black said. \"You had what they call vigilance committees, people who [were] almost like members of a volunteer fire department.\"If word got out that a freedom seeker was being apprehended, Black said the vigilance committee would spring into action. That could mean forming a mob around that person to create confusion so they could escape to a safe house.Some of these safe houses were downtown, including the home of abolitionist Martin Delany and the barbershop and bathhouse of John Vashon.\"So people were able to get clean clothes,\" Black said. \"He would change their appearance, whether they need a haircut, shave, whatever they needed cosmetically so that they would not be detected.\" The Monongahela House Hotel, once on the corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Smithfield Street was a stop, as was Avery College, on the corner of Avery and Nash streets on the North Side.David Vater said people on the Underground Railroad journey knew Mount Washington's Bigham House was safe if they saw a quilt or lantern out on the balcony.On the top floor of the house, the ceilings are shorter because there's an extra floor accessible only through an access door on the ceiling. That's where the Bigham familiy nurse Lucinda Bryant lived. Bryant was a black woman who had come from the South, and some suspect she herself had escaped slavery.\"It's thought that perhaps the rooms beside her bedroom would have been where some of the slaves would have stayed overnight,\" Vater said. This is part of our Good Question! series where we investigate what you've always wondered about Pittsburgh, its people and its culture. There are many other places in Pittsburgh that are rumored to have been Underground Railroad stops. Samuel Black said the evidence only confirms the existence of these five stops. But, he said there were hundreds of people in the area who were sympathetic to the antislavery movement.\"They may have used their home as a place of refuge one time in a lifetime,\" Black said. \"Even if you find evidence that someone was harboring fugitives in their home, it doesn't mean their home was a stop on the network.\" Tags Identity & Community 90.5 WESA's Good Question!Local StoriesUnderground RailroadSamuel BlackDavid VaterChatham VillageTrending Facebook LinkedIn Email Kathleen J.

The Vogues Harmony-pop vocal group formed in 1960 by lead baritone Bill Burkette, baritone Don Miller, first tenor Hugh Geyer, and second tenor Chuck Blasko, who were all high school friends from Turtle Creek. Originally dubbed the Val-Aires, the foursome eventually reached the number four spot in the autumn of 1965 with \"You're the One.\" Most memorable hit, the classic \"Five O'Clock World,\" cracked the Top Five. Two more Top 40 entries, \"Magic Town\" and \"The Land of Milk and Honey,\" followed in 1966. Resurfaced in 1968 with the Top Ten smash \"Turn Around, Look at Me.\" The single, the Vogues' lone million-seller, anticipated the lighter, more sophisticated approach of subsequent hits like \"My Special Angel,\" \"Till,\" and \"No, Not Much.\" Various Vogues lineups continue touring oldies circuits. The Skyliners Pittsburgh vocal group made it big with a magnificent heartache ballad in 1959, \"Since I Don't Have You,\" among R&B's greatest hits. Led by vocalist Jimmy Beaumont, with Janet Vogel, Wally Lester, Joe VerScharen, and Jackie Taylor. Legend has it that Janet ad libbed the song's memorable ending in high C (after repeating thirteen \"you's\") as a joke during rehersals. The group liked it so much they made it a permanent part of their arrangement. More than a dozen labels rejected the song before it was released by a local Pittsburgh label, Calico Records. Their follow-up, \"This I Swear,\" peaked at number 20 on the R&B charts. In recent years, The Skyliners created not one, but two Christmas standards. The group's version of the Beaumont/Rock compositions \"You're My Christmas Present\" and \"Another Lonely New Year's Eve\" are not only heard across America each holiday season, but have been included on a number of holiday compact disc collections. The ensemble was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002. The Mellon Family Andrew W.

Was perhaps the first person of wealth to state publicly that the rich have a moral obligation to give away their fortunes.In 1889 wrote The Gospel of Wealth, asserting that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community. Set about disposing of his fortune through innumerable personal gifts and through the establishment of various trusts. In his thirties, gave his first large gifts to his native town. Later created seven philanthropic and educational organizations in the United States, including Carnegie Corporation of New York.

In what would be one of the deadliest labor-management conflicts in the nation‚Äôs history, some 12 people were killed when striking workers attacked 300 Pinkerton detectives hired by the plant‚Äôs management as security guards. Carnegie Steel vs. Steelworkers‚Äô UnionBy 1892, Andrew Carnegie had worked his way up from his poor childhood in Scotland to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful industrialists in the United States. He was the majority shareholder of Carnegie Steel, the nation‚Äôs largest steelmaker, as well as a leading philanthropist who voiced public support for labor causes, including the right of workers to unionize. But when Henry Clay Frick, chairman and chief executive of Carnegie Steel, wanted to cut workers‚Äô wages at the plant in Homestead, located near Pittsburgh on the south bank of the Monongahela River, Carnegie supported Frick‚Äôs efforts despite his public pro-labor stance. Homestead was one of the most important of Carnegie Steel‚Äôs vast network of iron, steel and coke works, and Frick‚Äôs efforts would pit him against the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, one of the largest unions in the country. Beginning of the Homestead strikeWith the union‚Äôs three-year contract with Carnegie coming to an end in June 1892, Frick announced pay cuts for hundreds of Homestead workers. After refusing to negotiate with the union, he shuttered the Homestead steel mill on June 29, locking 3,800 workers out. Only around 725 of those workers belonged to Amalgamated, but all of them voted to strike, surprising Frick, who had assumed only union members would strike. After Frick had a high fence topped with barbed wire built around the mill itself, leading workers to dub it ‚ÄúFort Frick,‚Äù armed workers surrounded the plant and sealed off the town. In order to protect the strikebreakers he planned to hire, Frick followed the example of many industrialists battling unions and called in the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Pinkerton detectives had become known for infiltrating unions and breaking strikes nationwide, including at another Carnegie plant a few years earlier. PhotoQuest/Getty ImagesStereoscopic photograph showing striking steel workers on a hill above the Carnegie Steel Company's Homestead Steel Works in Homestead, Pennsylvania, July 1892.Arrival of the Pinkertons and Outbreak of ViolenceEarly on the morning of July 6, around 300 Pinkerton detectives arrived on barges pulled by tugboats along the Monongahela River. When word arrived of their approach, thousands of striking workers and their families rushed to the river to keep them from coming ashore at Homestead. The two groups exchanged gunfire, with the Pinkertons armed with Winchester repeating rifles and the workers on higher ground firing down on the barges with ancient guns and even an old cannon. After the Pinkertons repeatedly raised a white flag, the workers finally accepted their surrender by early evening. Nearly a dozen people had been killed by then, and a crowd of men, women and children brutally beat the Pinkertons who came ashore after their surrender. At Frick‚Äôs request, the governor of Pennsylvania soon sent 8,500 National Guard forces to Homestead, who quickly secured the steel mill and placed the plant and the surrounding town under martial law. While the conflict at Homestead was playing out, Carnegie was vacationing at a remote castle in Scotland, where he spent much of each year. Though workers and members of the press tried to reach him, he remained inaccessible but stayed in communication with Frick, whose actions he endorsed. Impact of the Homestead strikeThough the Homestead workers initially enjoyed widespread public support, this changed after their brutal treatment of the Pinkertons, as well as an attempt made on Frick‚Äôs life in late July by the anarchist Alexander Berkman, who had no connection with the union. Homestead resumed operations in full by mid-August 1892, thanks to some 1,700 strikebreakers, including some of the state‚Äôs first Black steelworkers. Many of the striking workers had returned to work by mid-October, and the union admitted defeat the following month. The strike‚Äôs leaders were charged with murder, and others with lesser crimes. None were convicted, but the damage to unionized labor at Homestead had been done. With Amalgamated out of the way, Carnegie slashed wages across the board, implemented a 12-hour workday and cut hundreds of jobs in the years to come. The Homestead debacle helped turn public opinion against the use of hired help like the Pinkertons in labor disputes, and 26 states passed laws outlawing it in the years following the strike. Carnegie‚Äôs own reputation suffered irreparable damage, with critics branding him a hypocrite and a coward for hiding out in Scotland and allowing Frick to do the dirty work. Still, profits at Carnegie Steel continued to rise as its productivity outpaced its competitors, even as membership in the Amalgamated dropped from more than 20,000 in 1892 to 8,000 by 1895. The Homestead strike broke the power of the Amalgamated and effectively ended unionizing among steelworkers in the United States for the next 26 years, before it made a resurgence at the end of World War I.
