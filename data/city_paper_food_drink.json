We ranked all four By Stacy Rounds click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Outside Polska Laska Pittsburghers love pierogies. Growing up in Erie, I thought the popularity of this inexpensive Polish delight was a regional thing in the Gem City, but Pittsburgh is even more obsessed with the potato-filled dumplings than its weird little northern sibling. From Mrs. T’s Pierogi runners to the vegan delights at Apteka, we’re the surefire winner of pierogi obsession among Pennsylvania’s populace. Polska Laska, a new Polish restaurant in Sharpsburg, offers not one, not two, but five varieties of pierogi. Pittsburgh City Paper marketing coordinator Candace Davis and I decided to sample Polska Laska’s pierogies and determine which flavor(s) are the best, March Madness-bracket style. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Interior at Polska Laska After a busy Friday morning earning our paychecks, Candace and I set off on our maiden voyage to Polska Laska around lunchtime. After taking advantage of the free, ample street parking, we joined the big crowd ready to dine at this new establishment. The decor was colorful and cute, with little cabbage decorations on the tables. The water station was convenient and adorable. The staff was friendly. The restroom was clean. And though the place was packed, we didn’t wait more than 20 minutes to secure a couple of bar seats. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Our meal at Polska Laska Anyone who knows me knows I can pack away a decent amount of food. And I came hungry that day. I grabbed a beet salad from the cooler to start. Candace and I ordered a bowl of pickle soup (the weekly special), golobki (a cabbage roll with beef, pork, rice, and tomato sauce), haluski made with spaetzle, and two sample platters with all five available flavors of pierogies (four of which are menu staples): potato cheddar, potato onion, farmer’s cheese and herb, kraut and shroom, and their special of the week, Philly cheesesteak. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds One of each flavor of pierogi at Polska Laska How does one rate a pierogi? My cohort, Candace, is a fan of crunch and creativity. I love both boiled and pan-seared dumplings and am a classic pierogi purist. Therefore, I have created a bracket highlighting both our points of view. click to enlarge CP Image: Stacy Rounds The CP Pierogi Madness bracket While the flavors at Polska Laska vary from new takes to classics (plus a weekly special), the suppleness of the dough, the amount of filling, the presentation, and the accompaniments don’t waver. The half-and-half method of soft boiling and pan-searing leaves them mostly soft while balancing the texture with a buttery crunch. In short, all of their pierogies are consistent and amazing. The potato onion and kraut and shroom are vegan-friendly, adding to the other vegan offerings featured on the everyday menu. Unsurprisingly, I loved the classic potato cheddar pierogi the best. Candace loved the Philly cheesesteak special but named the kraut and shroom as her favorite from Polska Laska’s everyday selection. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Pickle soup and pierogies at Polska Laska I noticed other diners enjoying the Polska Platter, with pierogies, carmies, sausage, pickles, haluski, and other amazing-looking accompaniments. I, a huge fan of kielbasa with pickles, was drooling over this board. I regret not ordering this smorsgabord, but now I have a reason to return to Polska Laska as soon as possible.Polska Laska. 1100 N.

Whether you're a lifelong herbivore or just dipping your toes into plant-based eating, there's a lot of delicious dishes out there to be had: from seitan cheesesteaks dripping with melty goodness to cinnamon rolls hefty enough to double as a free weight, Pittsburgh’s plant-based scene is stacked with bold flavors, creative cooking, and zero sad salads. If you’re after nostalgic comfort food, global flavors, or something fresh and vibrant, these are the vegan and vegetarian spots in Pittsburgh you should be checking out. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jeff Schreckengost The Zenith The Zenith 86 S. 26th St., South Side. zenithpgh.com Walking into The Zenith feels like stepping into a fever dream curated by your eccentric great-aunt who collects mannequin heads and might be a witch. Part thrift shop, part art gallery, part vegetarian haven, this spot surrounds you with mismatched tables, mannequin torsos, and vintage Easter bunnies — all of which are for sale. If you've ever wanted to impulse-buy a creepy porcelain doll while eating seitan stew, this is your moment. The menu changes weekly, but expect deep, comforting flavors that don’t mess around. The portobello stew is a dark, rich blend of mushrooms, carrots, and potatoes over steaming rice. The jalapeño hummus wrap packs a garlicky, zesty kick, and the vegan seitan orange \"beef\" will make you forget real beef ever existed. Dessert is non-negotiable — the vegan cakes here are legendary. Whether it’s chocolate fudge, lavender-lemon, or peanut butter dream, order whatever’s on deck. click to enlarge CP Photo: jared Wickerham Apteka Apteka 4606 Penn Ave., Bloomfield. aptekapgh.com No frills, no reservations, no apologies. This Bloomfield staple has been redefining plant-based dining since 2016, proving that cabbage, buckwheat, and potatoes can be downright thrilling. Forget boring salads — Apteka turns Central and Eastern European classics vegan without losing an ounce of flavor. The pierogi, stuffed with smoky potatoes, parsnips, and sauerkraut, are little pockets of perfection. The gołąbki (cabbage rolls filled with buckwheat and tomatoes) are the definition of comfort food. Chefs Kate Lasky and Tomasz Skowronski lean into Tomasz’s Polish roots, reinterpreting them through a plant-based lens with an emphasis on fermentation, smoke, and umami. Their approach extends to the wine list, where funky pét-nats and skin-contact wines pair seamlessly with the food’s depth and complexity. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Allegro Bakery Allegro Bakery 2034 Murray Ave., Squirrel Hill. allegropgh.com At Allegro Bakery, plant-based baking is anything but restrictive. The seitan melt layers spice-rubbed seitan, oat cheese, tangy sauerkraut, and slow-roasted tomatoes between crisp sourdough for a deeply satisfying bite. The avocado sandwich is a study in balance — cucumber for crunch, shiitake bacon for smokiness, tahini for richness, and pickled red onion for acidity. The pastry case is not to be missed. Rugelach and hamantaschen bring old-school nostalgia, while chocolate croissants and cruffins prove that, yes, vegan pastries can still be gloriously buttery. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jeff Schreckengost ShadoBeni ShadoBeni 1534 Brighton Rd., North Side. shadobeni412.com Inside ShadoBeni, and the air is thick with turmeric, cumin, and slow-simmered coconut milk. Buss up shut (flaky paratha-style roti) arrives at the counter, begging to be swiped through stewed channa, pumpkin choka, and fiery mango sauce. Coconut-infused rice bowls are served with roasted vegetables, a mound of earthy bhaji (spinach choka), and caramelized plantains. Named after culantro (aka \"shado beni\" in Trinidad), this North Side gem is a love letter to Caribbean flavors. Owner Ulric Joseph grew up pulling herbs from his backyard, eating honey straight from the comb, and learning that food is medicine, tradition, and connection. Everything here is made from scratch, from fire-roasted chokas to buttery, melt-in-your-mouth roti. What started as a farmers market favorite is now a full-fledged Trinidadian oasis in the middle of Pittsburgh. Moodz Co. 2210 E. Carson St., South Side. moodzcompany.org Moodz Co. was founded on a simple idea: plant-based food should hit just as hard as the classics. No joyless salads, no obligatory quinoa — just cheesesteak hoagies, candied mac and cheese, and Buffalo “chkn” sandwiches that bring all the comfort. The menu walks the line between indulgence and refreshment. Hearty plates like vegan oxtails and gravy sit alongside lighter, vibrant options like tabbouleh and cold-pressed juices. Smoothie bowls and bubble tea round things out. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jeff Schreckengost Viridis location Viridis 626 Smithfield St., Downtown. @viridis.pgh on Instagram Viridis operates like a well-kept secret — limited hours, no fuss, just straight-up great vegan food. Open Thursday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., it’s the kind of place you plan your day around because once they’re out, they’re out. The menu reads like a greatest hits of plant-based comfort food. The Crispy Chick’n Sandwich swaps the usual for perfectly fried oyster mushrooms, stacked on a sesame bun with crisp lettuce, tomato, pickles, and vegan mayo. The Reuben takes brined seitan and kraut, slathers it in \"Almost Russian\" dressing, and tucks it all into toasted rye. Breakfast is a strong suit. The Pancake Special is as classic as it gets, while the Breakfast Burrito — stuffed with tofu scramble, seitan bacon, avocado, and spicy aioli — keeps things interesting. Pastries are a gamble (croissants sell out fast), but if you see a cinnamon roll or chocolate almond croissant, don’t hesitate. Pair it with a cold brew and call it a win. EYV (Eat Your Veggies) 424 E. Ohio St., North Side. @eyv_restaurant on Instagram While not strictly vegan or vegetarian, EYV treats vegetables as the main event, skipping processed meat substitutes in favor of technique and creativity. The broccoli “chicharróns” are lightly fried for an addictive crunch. The butternut squash falafel adds depth with nuttiness and spice. The cabbage pastrami, layered with Thousand Island hollandaise and paired with thick steak fries, proves that plant-based dishes can be just as indulgent as their traditional counterparts. Dessert keeps the momentum going with a roasted pumpkin roll served with coffee ice cream and caramel-mascarpone icing — an unexpected but totally necessary finale. click to enlarge CP Photo Square Cafe Square Café 134 S. Highland Ave., East Liberty. square-cafe.com A brunch staple, Square Café is as colorful as its plates — both in decor and flavor. Square Café isn’t trying to be a plant-based mecca, but somehow, it’s ended up as one. There are plenty of exciting options for vegans and vegetarians alongside the cafe’s classic brunch fare. The Very Vegan Square Breakfast is a commitment — plant-based sausage, scrambled ‘ZERO EGG,’ home fries, and a peanut butter pancake rich enough to stand alone. The Vegan Chive Biscuit Breakfast Sandwich delivers on flaky, buttery (but butter-free) comfort, while the Potato Cheese Pierogies stay gloriously old-school, caramelized onions and sour cream included.

They drive to a little town called North East — yeah, confusing, but it’s in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania. It’s the tail end of the harvest season, and winemakers are knee-deep in Concord grapes, hands stained purple, as they hustle to get the last of the crop. Heldstab and Puskarich are right there with them, filling their truck with hundreds of pounds of perfectly ripe grapes, all while keeping an eye on the clock for their mandatory Lake Erie coffee stop. Heldstab calls ahead to Orton’s Fruit Market, timing their trip perfectly — usually late September through mid-October — to make sure the Concord grapes are ripe and ready. Back in Pittsburgh at Leona’s, those grapes are turned into an ice cream that’s pure fall in a pint — deep, tangy, and bursting with flavor. But here’s where it gets even better: they sandwich that rich, purple goodness between crisp peanut butter cookies. The result? A fall-inspired PBJ ice cream sandwich that’s sweet, spiced, and cool — a perfect embodiment of what I like to call Ice Cream in a Jacket season around here. “We love our summer crowd,” Heldstab says, “but there’s something extra special about the folks who stick with us through the slow season. That’s why we offer flavors you can only get in the fall and winter. It’s part seasonality, part reward for our loyal winter ice cream fans.” When they’re not grabbing Concord grapes in North East, Pa., they’re hitting Triple B Farms for apples, strawberries, and raspberries or scooping up plums and pears from Pletcher’s Farm Market in Champion. Each haul fuels their seasonal ice cream magic. The folks at Millie’s lean into that magic, too. As Brand Director Jessica Suskin puts it, “Making ice cream in the off-season is a ton of fun for us — fall, winter, and holiday flavors are an exciting challenge because we want the ice creams to feel familiar and relevant to the season without being predictable or stale. It’s a fun annual exercise.” But at the end of the day, it’s tough for an ice cream shop when the weather turns cold. \"We’re lucky to have our bakery keeping things steady in the colder months,” says Elias Wilson, president at Glen’s Custard, “but I’d love to see more folks supporting their local shops during this time. A cold treat in winter has its own charm. Plus, it's always fun to see how creative people get with flavors — everything from spiced pumpkin to peppermint swirl. It’s a different vibe, but just as delicious.” So now that fall is here (and winter is knocking), if you think it’s time to put the ice cream away, you’re seriously missing out. Ice Cream in a Jacket season is when you can savor the cold stuff while wrapped up like a burrito. Forget tricks, let’s get straight to the local treats. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Millie's Treat U-Self ice cream from Millie's Millie’s Homemade Multiple locations Trick or treat? Why not both? Millie’s is whipping up Treat U-Self — Rice Krispies Treats® mixed with white chocolate and buttery goodness, all folded into spooky purple ube ice cream. And don’t miss their dairy-free Ghostly Grasshopper — mint gelato loaded with crushed Hydrox cookies, no real insects involved. Millie’s folds in new flavors every month, and while they’re holiday collection is under wraps, Suskin says they’re reupping their partnership with Eat’n Park “in a way that’s sure to please nostalgic yinzers everywhere.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Jeni's Bay Leaf Cheesecake ice cream from Jeni's Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams173 Bakery Square Blvd, Bakery Square If pumpkin spice gives you the heebie-jeebies, then Jeni’s fall collection is a safe space for you. Get ready for the Bay Leaf Cheesecake, a creamy, savory delight. Then there’s the Sweet Potato Marshmallow Praline; it’s like sweet potato casserole but in ice cream form. Seriously, you might be tempted to ditch the pie this year. (Just kidding. Don’t be that person.) Brr-Kee's Homemade Ice Cream 539 Allegheny Ave, Oakmont Over at Brr-kee’s, the Cinnamon-Spiced Apple Sundae is basically fall in a bowl. Apples? Check. Cinnamon? Check. Whipped cream that’ll make you want to hibernate? Oh yes. It’s like someone distilled a crisp October day and slathered it over vanilla ice cream. Rita’s Italian Ice Multiple locations At Rita’s, the Pumpkin Toffee Crunch Concrete mixes vanilla frozen custard, pumpkin crème, and toffee. Or go for Dracula’s Delight: a mix of vanilla and chocolate custard, gummy bears, and mini M&M’s for a spooky sweet treat. Glen's Frozen Custard Multiple locations If you’re all about that pumpkin life, Glens Custard is where it’s at. We’re talking Pumpkin Roll Sundaes and Pumpkin Custard Pies galore. And when the chill sets in, their hot chocolate float will warm your heart — or whatever's left of it. Mercurio’s 1335 Freeport Rd. # 2 Besides artisanal pizza, Mercurio’s is serving up plenty of fall-inspired gelato flavors. Try their Black Cherry Bordeaux, featuring cherry gelato and salted dark chocolate flakes. Don’t miss their S’mores flavor: graham gelato, mini marshmallows, and chocolate, all in one scoop. It’s giving campfire vibes in a cup. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Leona's A fall-inspired ice cream sandwich from Leona's Leona’s Ice Cream 774 Penn Ave. In addition to seasonal scoops like maple nut and tangerine blackberry, Leona’s specializes in ice cream sandwiches. Fall flavors include plum on ginger molasses cookies and pear caramel on sugar cookies. Don’t miss the aforementioned PBJ ice cream sandwich made with Concord grape ice cream — your childhood classic reimagined as a frozen treat.

Lent is here, so it’s officially fish fry season. That means, on every social media platform out there, everyone in town is asking where to find the best fish fries in Pittsburgh. From Community Kitchen to the Elks Lodge to various parishes and fire departments, there are literally hundreds of great fish fry options here in the Steel City. But some tummies can’t handle all that fried batter. And some folks have celiac disease or allergies and sadly can’t go anywhere near a giant deep-fried whitefish filet (I added some gluten-free substitution suggestions below). Let me introduce you to a recipe that was printed way back in the year 2000, which feels, at least to me, like it was five years ago and not twenty-five years ago. This fish is not deep-fried, but stick with me because it’s a twenty-minute meal that serves up plenty of flavor and crunch. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds The Best of QED Cooks page 46 I get it. Fried fish is the best part of Lent. Without it, we’re just giving up one of our vices for 40 days. Plus, fish fries are great places to socialize and support local causes. Also, I won’t argue with the magic of a crispy fish filet, even if some are simply too big for consumption. But this recipe is easy enough for a Friday evening after a long workweek, fancy enough to make you feel like you actually planned ahead, and it won’t leave your kitchen smelling like hot fryer oil. Plus, since this Seafood Gremolade recipe came from The Best of QED Cooks, you know it’s good. I made this recipe last Friday for my kids. Yes, they happily scarfed this down. I paired it with some store-bought waffle fries, and the whole meal came together in less than half an hour. For once, I followed the recipe, mostly. I don’t recommend changing a thing because you don’t have to. I made a couple of small adjustments for the sake of convenience. The original recipe reads as follows: 2-4 fish filets Salt and pepper to taste ½ cup flour 2 Tbsp. olive oil ¼ cup plain breadcrumbs 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 Tbsp. parsley 1 Tbsp. lemon zest Pat filets dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Lightly coat with flour, patting filets to remove any excess flour. Sauté in olive oil until filets begin to brown, turning once. Place filets on an oven-proof tray in a 350°F oven for 7 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. After 7 minutes, remove the fish from the oven and sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top. Place under a broiler until the topping is golden brown. Serve immediately. You can use any mild white fish for this recipe such as flounder, turbot, cod, or haddock. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds 3 haddock filets I chose haddock because Giant Eagle had a ton in stock. My pack came with three happy little filets that would be more than enough to feed myself and my two small humans. I seasoned and floured my fish per the recipe and drizzled about 2 Tbsp. of olive oil in my cast iron skillet. I seared them for about 3 minutes on each side before popping the skillet into the oven. I did not transfer my fish to a new pan because who wants to do more dishes? Not me! Meanwhile, I made the topping. The only plain breadcrumbs I had in my pantry were panko breadcrumbs. Even crunchier! I chopped up some fresh parsley, microplaned my lemon zest, and mixed in some packaged pre-minced garlic. I had to stir this mixture vigorously to combine it well. After 7 minutes, I pulled my skillet out of the oven and placed the topping on the fish. I turned on the broiler (which took three tries since it didn’t initially want to cooperate) and placed the fish underneath for about 3 minutes so it would brown but not burn. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Finished fish filets This was a lovely way to enjoy some fish. The lemon and garlic flavors didn’t overpower the fish. The crunchy but not deep-fried texture was wonderful. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities, this recipe would work well with gluten-free flour and gluten-free rice panko breadcrumbs.

Last year and the year before, Community Kitchen only offered curbside pick up, and although they still offer take-out this year, Flanagan says everyone is “super thrilled” to be back in-person. Their fish fry menu features hand-battered haddock. “I know people are very particular about the kind of fish they get at their fish fries,” Flanagan says. “We do hand-battered fish, fresh cut fries. We make everything here that we can. We're making the cole slaw, we're making the haluski, we’re making our own tartar sauce. We're a culinary school, right? So why not do everything fresh?” click to enlarge CP Photo: Pam Smith A volunteer wraps up an order at Community Kitchen Pittsburgh in Hazelwood. Community Kitchen Pittsburgh is not just any culinary school, however. “We tend to support people who have barriers to employment or people who are looking to get back into the workforce,” Flanagan says. Their Hazelwood space offers paid training programs, transitional employment opportunities, apprenticeships, and job placement services to connect students to stable higher-than-entry-level jobs in the culinary industry. According to Community Kitchen Pittsburgh’s website, all programs are free of charge, and they pay their participants. “Some of our folks are coming out of incarceration, some of them are transitioning out of homelessness,” Flanagan says. “We've had women coming out of domestic violence situations. We've also had high school dropouts. And then we've had people who just need to get back into the workforce. They want to switch careers. So we have a whole case management staff, and we do a lot of work around removing the barriers for people so that they can have successful employment.” Flanagan says that, in addition to being their biggest annual fundraiser, the fish fry provides a valuable opportunity for students to learn and work in a more restaurant-like environment. “We don't have a lot of opportunities for our students to learn a la carte,” she says, “which is ticketed meals. You know, fast paced. This definitely gives them that experience, so it’s a really great training opportunity for our students.” When they’re not frying up fish for sandwiches, Community Kitchen Pittsburgh students learn culinary skills by helping the organization produce about 2,000 meals each day. click to enlarge CP Photo: Pam Smith A volunteer packages orders during Fish Fry Friday at Community Kitchen Pittsburgh in Hazelwood. “Those meals are going to shelters or other nonprofits, child nutrition programs, basically food-insecure, low-income, vulnerable populations,” says Flanagan. “And so our students, they're learning their curriculum in the context of doing all those meals every day. They learn the trade by giving back to the community, which is a really nice full circle.” Flanagan also wants diners to know that all tips and donations received at the fish fry go into their Student Assistance Fund, which supports students with emergent employment barriers. “That Student Assistance Fund is really critical in the kind of support that we can offer,” she says. “We've helped a woman leaving domestic violence get a new apartment, we've helped people get driver's licenses back, helping people with the things that come up for them that are going to impact their ability to get and keep a job.”Fish Fries at Community Kitchen Pittsburgh. 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Fridays through April 15.

For instance: blood-orange-glazed beets with soft, fresh stracciatella cheese; fingerling potatoes with faro; toast with a rotating selection of rich toppings, and more. Much of the fare is locally sourced from places like Penn’s Corner, Butcher on Butler and Heritage Farms. “It’s a neighborhood café,” explains Hilty, who runs the kitchen alongside Csilla Thackray, formerly of Bar Marco. “Our whole thing is using very high-quality ingredients.” European-style counter service helps keep the prices at “that nice casual price point,” says Hilty — most items fall in the $7-14 range — and you’d be hard-pressed to find a more welcoming and helpful staff.

Their responses have been added to the end of this article. Update March 8 at 2:30 p.m.: Part of a statement from Milhaus has likewise been added. Lawrenceville is getting a Starbucks, and not everyone is happy about it. A LinkedIn announcement late last week confirmed that Milhaus, the Indianapolis-based developer of Lower Lawrenceville's mixed-use development Arsenal 201, had confirmed Starbucks as a tenant in Arsenal 201's corner parcel facing 40th St. On Mar. 5, community organization Lawrenceville United (LU) took to social media to decry the deal as a \"direct violation of commitments\" Milhaus had previously made to the Lawrenceville community. \"It was very disappointing to hear this news secondhand,\" LU executive director Dave Breingan tells Pittsburgh City Paper. He says LU and community members had pushed for Milhaus to maintain the neighborhood's locally owned character — the developer verbally did so during well-attended community meetings held during the planning and construction of the hulking apartment and retail complex. LU has since urged locals to make their voices heard by contacting Milhaus and supporting local unionizing Starbucks workers in their efforts. \"In their own words, they said 'the project team plans on courting local retail and restaurant options and not big box or national chains,'\" Breingan says. \"There were no written or binding agreements about this, unfortunately.\" The voicemail inbox to Milhaus' publicly listed phone number was full when City Paper called, and multiple emailed requests for comment to the developer went unanswered as of press time. On March 8, Milhaus responded to CP, saying the developer would continue to work with LU and touting the fact that 80% of Arsenal 201's retail space is occupied by local businesses. \"Our team has worked diligently over the last seven years to identify high-quality tenants to fill our retail space and we believe that the addition of Starbucks will complement, not detract from the commercial fabric of Lawrenceville. We will continue to work closely with Lawrenceville United and the Lawrenceville Corporation to support their shared vision for fostering a unique and thriving community,\" Milhaus vice-president of development Brad Vogelsmeier told CP via email. The outcry represents the latest negative response to an out-of-state developer leasing to out-of-state stores and chains during a time of rising rents. In 2021, McCaffery Interests irked many when they courted, then ghosted, Bloomfield-based White Whale Bookstore, bringing in national chain Posman Books instead. Locals see similarities in Milhaus' latest move. click to enlarge CP Photo: Joie Knouse View of the 201 Arsenal Condominiums from the TRYP Hotel on 40th Street Sarah Walsh, owner of Upper Lawrenceville coffeehouse Caffè d'Amore, tells CP \"it's kind of like going on a date with somebody and being like, 'Hey, I said you can kiss me on the cheek,' and then they go for something else.\" Walsh says LU and the Lawrenceville Corporation have been indispensable partners for businesses like hers, fostering a Butler St. business landscape that's over 70% locally owned and 30% women-owned. \"I can't imagine burning a bridge like that,\" Walsh says. Walsh says developers aren't inherently bad — Illinois-based Albion Residential has similar plans for an empty stretch of Butler St. across from Caffè d'Amore — but says it's important that these developers cultivate trust with locals. \"We want more people in the neighborhood and more people supporting the businesses in the neighborhood,\" she tells CP, \"but it's all about how you do it.\" Milhaus, for one, initially reached out to Walsh and other area business owners but then failed to follow up, she says. \"It would set up the developers in the neighborhood for a much better reception for the businesses that they're leasing to if they listen, and they actually care about what the neighborhood says,\" Walsh tells CP. She reminds Lawrenceville residents and others to \"vote with your dollars\" to prevent local businesses from getting muscled out. Breingan says what the neighborhood needs is not a Starbucks, but groceries. \"An affordable grocery store has long been a priority from the community and was specifically requested in the community process around this particular development,\" he tells CP. \"A use that's accessible and serves our local neighbors would be ideal.\" Meanwhile, he's frustrated by the Starbucks lease. \"We have always tried to be reasonable,\" he says, \"which is why adding a mega-chain like Starbucks that competes with many of our long-time independent cafés is such a betrayal.\" For its part, the Seattle-based coffee giant contacted CP after the original publication of this article through Sam Jefferies of Starbucks media relations. Jefferies said, \"We look forward to joining and contributing to the Lawrenceville community beginning in fall 2024. It is a thriving community that allows all types of businesses to exist together, and customers will choose the coffee experience that is best for them. We know our customers are passionate about coffee as well as their local businesses, and we believe independent stores and small chains can continue to grow and thrive along with Starbucks. It is all in service of elevating specialty coffee — which is a good thing for everyone.\" Asked about neighborhood interest in attracting a grocer, Jefferies said Starbucks wouldn't comment on areas outside of its business, but that the company \"plan[s] to use this space to make connections with customers over coffee.\" Jefferies also said Starbucks has formed positive relationships with local nonprofits and will likewise extend opportunities to \"nominate a neighborhood nonprofit\" for grant opportunities to its Lawrenceville location. Pittsburgh-area Starbucks locations have been the scene of a flurry of union activity — workers at the Sixth St. store in Downtown just announced a successful union vote on Mar. 6. The company has tentatively agreed to contracts with more than 50 members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and denies that it engages in union-busting behaviors. CP also reached out to Starbucks Workers United for this article. Through a representative, the union declined to comment, citing the ongoing strike at the Post-Gazette and Block Communications, Inc.'s ownership of Pittsburgh City Paper.

I’ve enjoyed brisket and horseradish during a Jewish friend’s Passover celebration, dumplings made by a fellow grad student for Chinese New Year, and pączki, that filled, donut-like Polish pastry associated with Fat Tuesday. In heavily Catholic areas like Pittsburgh, another tradition returns every spring — that of Lent, a time when worshippers abstain from, among other things, alcohol, red meat, and dairy. Over 40 days, meant to symbolize the time Jesus spent fasting in the desert, local parishes break out the hot oil to fry loads of breaded fish, one of the few delicacies Catholics can indulge in around this time. From the beginning of March to mid-April, lines will form outside church basements and community centers, ready to tear into hot slabs of cod often paired with French fries or coleslaw. Even I enjoy this custom, especially this year, the first since I’ve relaxed my loyalty to vegetarianism. Still, my meat consumption is reserved for special occasions, and what’s more special than a good old-fashioned Pittsburgh fish fry? But something has nagged at me since I started partaking in this Lenten tradition: the fish is too big. Maybe it’s the stubbornly modest Pa. Dutch values on which I was raised. While others may love the excess of a breaded fish longer than the average forearm, I am a seafood puritan, a pragmatic killjoy who gets off on denying myself even the most humble of luxuries. I prefer scratchy towels and burgers with no cheese and complain about too much icing on cakes. Now that I have outed myself as the Scrooge of fish-based holidays, please, Catholic fam, at least hear me out. click to enlarge CP Photo: Lisa Cunningham Riverview Church Fish Fry First, there should be options for single fish fryers and those who prefer to eat their whale of a white fish in one sitting. Otherwise, the leftovers would be taken home, forgotten, and thrown out, especially for an ADHD case like myself. This presents a financial opportunity for the churches trying to raise money through these fries. Split that fish in half, and charge me a nominally lighter fee. I’ll pay it if I don’t have to feel the guilt of wasting perfectly fine fish as I predictably leave it to congeal and harden into something unreheatable. Second, why does my massive catch of the day come with a thimble of tartar sauce? For me, the fish partly serves as a mere vehicle to deliver this tangy condiment to my big, dumb mouth. And yet, the amount I receive does little more than soak into the breading and relatively tiny bun, never to be detected again. Please, make with the sauce! Thirdly, make the bun optional. Why waste valuable fish real estate with bread that offers little more than empty, unsatisfying carbs? Why detract from a flakey, succulent slab of hot haddock or pollock with a dry, mass-produced roll? Admittedly, not every fish fry sandwiches its offerings, but those that do could benefit financially by asking \"bread or no bread?\" Lastly, perhaps provide a vegetarian or vegan option. While I've, to a certain degree, welcomed animal flesh back into my system, there are still those who keep it strictly plant-based, and they deserve a little taste of Lent, too. In the past, I've chowed down on some delicious fish alternatives, including a mushroom number temporarily sold at the now-closed B52 restaurant in Lawrenceville. Local spots like Shado Beni and Wild Rise Bakery serve up non-fish Lenten offerings, but it would be lovely to see them become more widespread and accessible. Granted, Catholic organizations don't need to change the way they do things, or bring me on as a genius fish fry consultant looking to disrupt the industry. Diners will still flock to their respective fry hubs even as a heathen like me complains that \"fish is too big.\" What's important is that this tradition continues to bring joy and a sense of community to a lot of Pittsburghers, serving as a bright, delicious ray of light after the harsh blah of winter.

In Pittsburgh, the treat has risen in popularity, popping up at local bakeries and Giant Eagles. And with Fat Tuesday rolling around later than usual this year on March 5, that gives businesses more time to serve the decadent treat. “We get inundated with phone calls and emails asking when we’re going to start selling them,” says Laura Powell of Party Cake Shop in Brookline. Powell – whose parents, Scott and Nancy Smith, own and run Party Cake – says the store started selling pączki in the early-2000s when they noticed the dessert becoming trendy. They now sell around 300 dozen a week beginning the second week of January. The genesis of pączki is a lesson in resourcefulness: dating back to the Middle Ages, people made them to use up any perishable lard, butter, eggs, milk, and fruit in anticipation of Lent fasting. Rich dough balls are fried and filled with everything from traditional jams made of stewed plums or rose hips to custards and sweet jellies of lemon, raspberry, and apple. They are then rolled in powdered sugar, iced, or glazed. While pączki are compared to donuts, Powell believes they offer more than their fried dough counterparts. “It’s unlike your traditional raised, glazed donut that you get any other time of the year, especially with all the fillings,” says Powell. “You get a lot of filling in there, so you might like your Boston cream donut with your cream filling, but you get a pączki with custard in it, you’re going to get a heck of a lot more custard.” The treat has a big following in the Midwest, to the point where many cities have a designated Pączki Day, but it took a while to catch on in Pittsburgh, despite the city’s strong Slavic heritage. Ania Becker, president of the Polish Culture Club at the University of Pittsburgh, explains that, even in the Polish diaspora, Tłusty Czwartek (Polish for Fat Thursday, a holiday occurring before Fat Tuesday) has always been a big day for both religious and non-religious Poles to feast on pączki. “Since Poles have been immigrating to Pittsburgh since the late 1800s, pączki were most definitely eaten in Pittsburgh, at least in those immigrant communities,” says Becker. “I will say, though, that finding good pączki is hard in Pittsburgh and most of the traditional pączki eaten would be homemade and not commercially sold.” Marc Serrao, owner of Oakmont Bakery in Oakmont, started making pączki in 1990 after reading about them in a trade magazine. He recalls initially making two dozen of them as an experiment and selling every single one. In an interview for Chatham University’s Western Pennsylvania Foodways Collection, Serrao says he first saw the pączki as a “super donut” that would appeal to customers. “I’ve really watched what’s trending,” he says in the interview, adding that they also tried to capitalize on the Cronuts phenomenon with their own creation, the Doughsánts. But unlike other pastry trends that have come and gone, including gourmet cupcakes, it seems as though pączki are here to stay. Since first introducing them nearly 30 years ago, Serrao believes his bakery has become well known in the area for pączki by offering 15 varieties, including the Polish staple prune filling, lekvar. “We sell over 1,000 on a slow day and 5,400 last year on Fat Tuesday,” says Serrao. “We had to add some equipment to keep up with them.” In order to keep up with demand, Oakmont and Party Cake have both bucked the tradition of halting pączki production during Lent. At Oakmont, the bakery begins selling them on First Night (Jan. 6) and continues through Easter, long after Fat Tuesday ends. “It’s a little unorthodox but it works well for us,” says Serrao. “They aren’t typically sold during Lent, but our customers demand them so we continue to make them.” Party Cake has started selling pączki for a few weeks in the summer when business slows down. They have also introduced new flavors, including peanut butter buttercream last year and, as of this Valentine’s Day, strawberry buttercream. “I think that’s something we might start doing since people really seemed to enjoy it,” Powell says of the latter.

He welcomes me to a tabletop Ms. Pac-Man machine, turns it on, and offers me a drink before immediately telling stories about the bar’s past. He loves stories, and he loves to laugh. When he does, his face scrunches, and his voice turns into a squeak before he erupts. “He’s a character,” Le Mardi Gras manager Zan Naz and I agree on the phone after I meet Costanzo. The bar’s annual Fat Tuesday event is approaching, which will be the bar’s 71st, and Costanzo’s 50th, celebration. “This is kind of a special one for all of us,” Naz says. “We’re trying to make it a bit extra for him.” Le Mardi Gras has proven itself to be one of the premier places to drink on Fat Tuesday, and this year, the bar hopes to mark its anniversaries by offering the same fun, but turned up a notch to honor the beloved bartender. Located up a flight of stairs at 731 Copeland St., Le Mardi Gras has a distinct, old-school feel. It’s cash only, has very strong drinks, and, because of a loophole offered to businesses that don’t sell much food, it still allows smoking. Every year for Fat Tuesday, Le Mardi Gras has bead necklaces, drink specials, and a live zydeco band, as well as toasts, speeches, and other camaraderie among regulars, former regulars, and newcomers. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Costanzo stands outside Le Mardi Gras in Shadyside. This year, the band starts playing at 8 p.m., and there will be a new drink menu featuring “greatest hits” from the bar’s history, all priced at $8 according to Naz. These favorites include the greyhound (Tito’s vodka and grapefruit) and an espresso martini (cold brew, Kahlua, Tito’s with cinnamon on top), and a series of classic New Orleans drinks, including a Hurricane. “You’ll be able to get the best of Mardi Gras for the best price,” Naz says. “We’re still doing the same as we’ve done the last two years, where we’re doing everything fresh. Not just the juices, but also house-made syrups, tinctures, all sorts of secret stuff we have behind the bar.” Naz provided Pittsburgh City Paper those details with ease — Costanzo is better for stories and personality. Fat Tuesday at the bar will be the same as every year, Costanzo says. Asked how he feels about it being his 50th year, he responds by describing the sensation of being young and going to, say, a 50th wedding anniversary party. “You say, ‘oh, one day it’ll probably be me,’ but it’s not that soon. It seems like it’s way out in the distance,” Costanzo says. “I’m very fortunate to be here, above the ground, and still doing it. I’m very fortunate that we were able to stay in business. I’ve had a lot of ups and downs. We’ve had a lot of things over the years.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Costanzo poses for a portrait on Mar. 2, 2025. Mardi Gras and Fat Tuesday are often associated with partying, but there’s also a religious foundation to it, serving as the last hurrah of gluttony before giving something up for Lent. Costanzo is religious, he confirms. He goes to church often and says he’s witnessed miracles throughout his life. In the early ’90s, he says, his son suffered an ear injury while playing sports. At a swimming pool one day, he leapt off a diving board and landed on his ear, blowing out his ear drum, Costanzo says. A doctor said it wouldn’t heal and that he’d need surgery. “I was going to church every day, praying, and one day, I felt something come over me. You know, like a feeling, a warm feeling, something different,” Costanzo says. Months passed since the swimming pool accident, and Costanzo found himself depressed. Then, at a doctor’s visit that would have preceded the surgery, Costanzo’s family got a surprise. “He said, ‘I can’t believe this.’ I said, ‘what can’t you believe?’ He said, ‘his ear is healed. I’ve never seen this,’” Costanzo recounts. Later in the conversation, when asked if he gives anything up for Lent, Costanzo smiled and returned to this story. “I love sweets. My son is 39, just turned 39. He was about seven or eight years old. I said, ‘Lord, if you heal his ear, so he doesn’t have to have an operation, I’ll never eat another piece of candy, I’ll never eat a cookie, I’ll never have a piece of cake, I’ll never have an ice cream cone, and I’ll never have a piece of pie ever again in my life,’” Costanzo says. “He healed him, and it’s been 31 years, I haven’t had anything [sweet].” So, when guests at the bar party this year and consider what they may want to give up for Lent, Costanzo will continue that 31-year-long, year-round sacrifice. In between all of the cigar puffs and rounds of drinks, patrons’ thoughts of sacrifice may have to wait until the morning.

Pittsburgh has options for going beyond Dry January By Katy Fleming click to enlarge Photo courtesy of the Open Road Dry January may be over, but the non-alcoholic movement continues to gain momentum across the country. Last month, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a public advisory warning that alcohol is the leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States. The report revealed a striking disconnect: while 76% of Americans consume at least one alcoholic beverage per week, fewer than half are aware of the direct link between alcohol and cancer risk. Dr. Natalie Gentile, co-founder of Direct Care Physicians of Pittsburgh and board-certified in both Family Medicine and Lifestyle Medicine, emphasizes the importance of educating the public on these risks. “It is becoming apparent that alcohol intake is something we need to take seriously, not just when it comes to risk for alcoholism, but as a risk factor for developing diseases such as cancer,” says Gentile. “There is evidence showing a relationship between alcohol intake and the development of certain cancers, including breast cancer in women [and] GI cancers such as esophageal, liver and colorectal, and throat, mouth and voice box.” According to the U.S. Surgeon General’s advisory, alcohol contributes to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths every year. While these statistics are prompting more people to explore sober-curious lifestyles, others remain skeptical. Historically, red wine was considered heart-healthy due to its antioxidant content. However, leading health organizations — including the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization — now state that no level of alcohol consumption is considered safe. “There doesn’t appear to be a known safe level of alcohol intake,” warns Gentile. “Some of these cancers can develop with alcohol use of less than one drink per day.” For those looking to cut back on alcohol, experts recommend understanding your personal motivations and recognizing when you typically drink. “Once you have a why, it makes it easier to incorporate that change, whether it's being sober curious or completely sober,” says Gentile. “ With the why and the knowledge of when you tend to drink alcohol more regularly, you can start to replace some of those times with a non-alcoholic beverage. For many people, there is a ritual component to having a drink (think nightcap), and you can still maintain the ritual but remove the alcohol from it.” For Pittsburghers seeking healthier alternatives, the city is home to the Open Road, the country’s oldest non-alc specialty retailer and winner of Pittsburgh's Best Mocktail 2023, currently celebrating five years in business. Launched in January 2020 as a pop-up bar, The Open Road established its first brick-and-mortar store in Allentown in March 2022. This year, the business is expanding — relocating to Pittsburgh’s Garfield neighborhood, where it will open a non-alcoholic bar alongside its retail store. This womxn-, neurodivergent-, LGBTQ-owned establishment was founded by Mel Babitz. “Like many founders, I started The Open Road to solve my own problem — a desire to have fun, interesting, complex, adult beverages outside of alcohol, other than coffee and the wonderful wide world of tea,” says Babitz. “It's so cool that adult non-alc has taken off like this in the time since I started the business.” (Of note: Some people see “mocktail” as a controversial term, as it can suggest that non-alcoholic beverages are inferior or merely an imitation.) click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz The Open Road's former Allentown location The Open Road partners with local organizations to provide that social component for sober friends in Pittsburgh. Every month, Babitz collaborates with Two Frays Brewery to host Mod Monday, an entirely non-alcoholic service featuring local options. Jackworth Ginger Beer, a ginger beer brewery in Larimer, partners with The Open Road for a zero-proof cocktail night once a month. Pittsburgh Mocktail Meetup is a casual, happy-hour style monthly event for non-drinkers and the sober curious to meet new friends. Two Frays Brewery regularly offers a variety of NA beer options on its menu, including two new collaborations — one with Dr. Gentile’s studio, Rebel Wellness, and another with The Open Road. The local non-profit, Teetotal Initiative, also frequently partners with Babitz to provide various free, fun social activities to support individuals in sustaining sobriety. “Lots of folks feel like they need to tell us or justify why they’re at the shop, but non-alc is for everyone,” says Babitz. “Please come to the shop, ask us all the questions about the drinks you’ve seen advertised online. Everything at the shop is available by the single can, and we encourage folks to try lots of different things. New options come out all the time!” Until its new Garfield location opens, the Open Road is running a pop-up inside Lawrenceville Hemp Co. “In reality, the benefits many of us feel when drinking are not all due to the alcohol itself. There is a big social component to drinking, feeling like we fit in with a community and enjoying the company of others over a drink,” says Gentile. “You can still get that feeling while having a non-alcoholic beverage, such as a mocktail or NA beer, which are becoming more and more popular and available.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Drink, Vivek Murthy, The Open Road, Dr. Natalie Gentile, Mel Babitz, Two Frays, Teetotal Initiative, Lawrenceville Hemp Co.

But Sumi's Cakery in Squirrel Hill proves that just a little bit of sweetness can go a long way toward making a satisfying baked treat. The Korean bakery opened last month and is the project of Sumi Chun, who hails from Seoul, South Korea and now lives in Cranberry. Korean baking, Chun says, is lighter and often doesn't include butter. It's also \"not too sweet and not too salty.\" Sumi's menu seems to cater to both tastes, however. \"For Americans, mocha cake is my specialty,\" she says. \"Koreans like the strawberry.\" On the day I visited, the menu offered: cupcakes topped with sweet whipped-cream or green-tea icing, strawberry meringues, cakes, assorted pastries, loaves of bread and even shaved ice. Chun says that shaved ice is a tradition in Korea, and she serves it with green tea, red bean or strawberry ice cream. The pastry buns were my favorite. The little pockets of dough had fillings both sweet (red beans, butter cream, mocha, crumbles, coffee) and savory (vegetables and sausage). The coffee bun had a pleasantly crispy exterior and a pillowy inside that offered hints of coffee. I shared the red-bean pastry with a colleague, who described it as having \"a shiny, soft-but-pliable crust, with filling that was sweet but not too sweet, with a smooth consistency not unlike Fig Newton filling.\" Take your sweet tooth to Sumi's Cakery, for a menu of new flavors.

One wrong step and the mollusk, which at its best is completely tender and silky, becomes jaw-tiringly chewy. It can be treated a number of ways — charred, stir-fried, or blanched — but it takes time and patience to execute correctly. Perhaps the best example of perfectly-cooked tentacles is from Oak Hill Post, a new neighborhood haunt in Brookline. The braised octopus — treated so well that all I could write down in my notes was three exclamation points in a row — can be found paired with handmade, stuffed tortelloni (beefed-up tortellini), Italian sausage, potatoes, brodo, and Grana Padano cheese. Oak Hill Post, nicknamed “O,HI,” and run by Christian Schulz and Rebecca Nicholson of the pop-up Menuette, was originally meant to be a brick-and-mortar for the former pop-up series. But Schulz told Pittsburgh City Paper in August that he and Nicholson felt “there wasn’t a place for Menuette” in a pandemic world, so they “started over.” Though I loved Menuette — I was lucky enough to snag food from them early in the pandemic before their rebrand — Oak Hill was created to be a direct response to community and industry needs. Their food, rivaled at any high-end restaurant in the city, is affordable, and they are a no-tipping establishment. Schulz told City Paper they chose to be a Post, rather than an eatery or restaurant, to stay away from a “system that maybe does more harm than good.” But Oak Hill, which offers a mix of sandwiches and pastas, a market option, and more on their ever-changing menu, has brought the innovation, quality, and excitement of Menuette with a smaller neighborhood feel. Back to the pasta: it was incredible. Hearty discs of sausage added a hint of spice and gave body to the light octopus, further filled out by the hefty tortelloni (they were the size of small dumplings). Tang from the warm olives poked through the rich components around it, the simple broth giving just enough flavor to tie everything together. To pair with my pasta — which was a play on one of Oak Hill’s opening-day sandwiches — I chose a beets-and-greens sandwich, pickled veggies, and frozen buttermilk biscuits. The sandwich, layered with thick, purple-bleeding beets, arugula, rapini, marinated olives, gribiche (a creamy, more-flavorful-than, but similar to mayo sauce), and boursin cheese, was placed on incredible bread. The slices were just bubbly enough to soak in the sauce and beet juice, but with crusty, salty edges. I was initially afraid the beets would be too earthy and take over the whole sandwich, but the bitter greens and creamy spreads balanced the tender root, spiking the sandwich with herby, peppery flavors. (I was too focused on the pasta to finish the sandwich — it was even better the next day when the flavors really started to soak into every corner.) The Oak Hill at Home market is one of my favorite things Schulz and Nicholson offer. It’s filled with locally-sourced, high-quality items, including fresh pasta and sauces they make in-house, ready to cook at home. Frozen biscuits and pickled veggies were my market choices. Even a bit squished from a brake-slamming incident on my drive home, they puffed right up in the oven. A tangy lemon curd cut through the rich, buttery layers. My container of pickled veggies lasted me only two days. The mix threw in a few surprises — Brussels sprouts, for one — and I ate them with everything. Needless to say, I can’t wait to see what Oak Hill brings to the table next.

Consider the humble chicken tender. Whether you're a picky eater or an open-minded one — and whether you call them tenders, strips, fingers, or goujons (since that's apparently a thing) — you've almost certainly eaten one at some point. They're simple, they're good, and they're a palate-pleaser for any omnivore. We here at Pittsburgh City Paper love and respect the tendie. When the topic came up during a recent editorial meeting, I jumped at the chance to try the city's best options, as did City Paper photographer Mars Johnson. Armed with a notebook, camera, and appetite, the two of us did our best to try every hyperlocal tender platter we could get our mouths on. What we found may surprise you. But first — a word on methodology. Any tender-taster worth their weight in breadcrumbs knows that not all tendies are created equal. Many of my personal favorite local dives serve tenders, but more than one simply fry up the out-of-the-bag Sysco tendies and call it a day, so none of those made the cut. (I'm omitting those establishments' names here out of respect for their better menu items and their tender-hearted bartenders.) I've also opted to skip chains in this ranking. Layne's, Cane's, Mad Chicken, Chicken Guy, and others probably have their tendie operations dialed in, but I wanted to see what true-blue Pittsburghers could produce in their deep fryers. And what they came up with was by turns crispy, juicy, saucy, and succulent. Behold: the best golden-fried boneless bites in the ’Burgh. This list, incidentally, is not exhaustive, but I am exhausted — expect my next food ranking to be the city's healthiest salads. The textbook tendie: Ruggers Pub 40 S. 22nd St., South Side click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Ruggers Pub in the Southside is serving up classic pub grub with rugby playing on TV and rugby memorabilia on the walls. Known for their rugby focus and throwback prices, Ruggers is one of the South Side's best bars. Their beer-battered tenders are basically the Platonic ideal of a chicken finger, with crunchy breading, just the right thickness, and nooks and crannies for your dipping sauce of choice. CP's minor quibbles during this particular visit were that our tendies were a touch overdone, and I could've done with a bigger ramekin of their black and gold sauce, but if you're craving a well-realized basic tender that isn't straight from the freezer, Ruggers has it, and the $7.99 price tag is eminently reasonable. The bountiful basket: Park Place Pub 5719-5721 Bryant St., Highland Park Highland Park's food scene may be known for more decadent delights from places like Teppanyaki Kyoto and Park Bruges, but the Applewood Smoke Burger Company at Park Place Pub also serves some of the city's absolute best burgers and pub grub, including their beer-battered tendie basket with fresh-cut fries. Come hungry — this basket is an embarrassment of riches, and I couldn't quite finish all my fries. Still, the apple-butter barbecue sauce is to die for, and everything came out crisp, hot, and delicious. Pickle power: Moonlit Burgers 1426 Potomac Ave., Dormont 1023 Forbes Ave., Uptown click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Pickle-brined and hand-breaded chicken tender at Moonlit Burgers. Moonlit in Dormont and Uptown has a secret weapon when it comes to their tendies: pickle brine. In addition to adding a savory tang, the brining process also leaves their tenders living up to that billing. The breading here wasn't as crispy as other spots' tenders, but the flavor made up for that. At three pieces for $7 and five for $10, they're reasonably priced, and come served with the restaurant's signature Moon Sauce. We'd definitely also recommend a side of shoestring fries to share. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Pickle-brined and hand-breaded chicken tender at Moonlit Burgers. British breading: The Pub Chip Shop 1830 E. Carson St., South Side Carson St. is full of good food, but for those seeking British fare, the Pub Chip Shop next to Piper's is a safe and flavorful bet. Their tenders came out piping hot and super juicy on a bed of the Shop's titular \"chips\" (which are basically wider fries). These were among the greasier tendies we tried, but the seasoned breading was delicious. Be forewarned that their homemade barbecue sauce is rather heavy on the Worcestershire. Spice is nice: Bird on the Run 128 S Highland Ave., East Liberty, and other locations CP PHOTO: Colin Williams Bird on the Run. Bird on the Run has expanded in recent years, but their no-frills location in East Liberty continues to serve their signature hot chicken dishes, including their hand-breaded hot tendies. The biggest selling point here is that Bird on the Run spices their tendies to order on a scale of \"not hot\" to \"RIP.\" I ordered the No. 2 (\"extra hot\") and was delighted with the slight kick and overall zestiness. My only complaint was that the sauce was pre-packaged rather than homemade. Also, I got grease all over my tablecloth, but that was very much a me problem as I ate these tendies straight out of the bag. Nashville naturals: CHiKN 3712 Forbes Ave. Unit 3., Oakland 20018 U.S. Hwy 19., Cranberry CHiKN is another place that serves Nashville chicken on a spectrum of spice, and they get extra points for their chicken being hormone- and antibiotic-free. Whether you're indulging in spiced tenders in Oakland or Cranberry, CHiKN hews fairly close to Nashville orthodoxy, including their Southern Comeback dipping sauce. These tendies are hot and juicy — whether you get their tendies, nugs, or a sandwich, expect to lick your fingers and use multiple napkins. Simply the best: E-Town Bar & Grille 304 Butler St., Etna click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson E Town Bar & Grille on Butler St. offers a beer-battered chicken tender. Like Ruggers, E-Town in Etna serves relatively unadorned tendies, but my god, are they juicy and delicious. While every tendie on this list is worthy of love, E-Town has figured out how to achieve a perfectly crunchy beer battering on the outside while maintaining the chicken's succulent, juicy character on the inside. These are the Goldilocks \"just right\" of Pittsburgh chicken tenders. Though they might not have the nooks-and-crannies texture of mass-produced chicken strips, the slight sweetness of the golden-brown batter and delicious white meat makes for fantastic eating with or without dipping sauce. E-Town's fish sandwich is likewise fried to perfection; it won an award from the Trib for it. Between the cheap drinks, kind locals, and fantastic food, this is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to snack on fried fingers while watching hockey or shooting the breeze. Plus, if you really like their tendies and want to eat 50 of them, E-Town also caters. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson E Town Bar & Grille on Butler St. offers a beer-battered chicken tender.

But few would point to the meat- and dairy-centric menus of northern Europe, east or west, as promising options for a vegan meal out. Apteka upends this assumption with its outspoken focus on “vegan Eastern European food.” Yet its offerings barely resembled the Eastern European standard-bearers of local restaurants, taverns and church festivals. They weren’t completely unfamiliar — the touchstones of pierogi, golumpki and borscht were present — but the flavors and textures amounted practically to re-inventions of these and other dishes. A big question we had going in was how the kitchen would deal with, quite literally, the meat of the matter, given its centrality to traditional Eastern European cooking. We are personally not fans of meat substitutes, preferring animal-free patties, loaves and pâtés that achieve heartiness and savor in their own right. Apteka scored high in this regard. While it has a few nominal meat replacements, most dishes took an unabashedly vegan route to robust umami flavor. The surprising exception was borscht, served in a teacup sans spoon and accompanied by a slice of toast topped with smoked celeriac pâté. The borscht was consommé-clear, and it perfectly balanced beet and, somehow, beef flavor. How? We cannot say, but the flavor was so true, it’s possible it might actually put off a committed vegetarian. We were quite pleased with it and the accompanying toast. The toast was made from a bread that recurred in several dishes, a classic, dense, seedy, brown central European bread of the type Angelique loves and Jason tolerates. But its robust presence worked well with the intense flavors that abounded. Here is the other way in which Apteka departs from local clichés about Polish food: The food here is vibrant, spicy, sometimes even flat-out hot. The side salad, for instance, was — quite unexpectedly — as fiery as anything from Thailand or Mexico, possibly from hot peppers in the escabeche. The other ingredients made for a simple but inspired alternative to the usual spring greens, tomatoes and cukes: mustard greens, shallot, apple, radish and sunflower seeds. Pittsburghers seem universally committed to serving their pierogies soft with butter and onions, but here again Apteka departed, using a fairly lean dough that fried up somewhere between pot sticker and empanada. In lieu of butter, there was sour cream-like “yogurt” sauce, and the pierogies were served stacked on a bed of shredded cabbage and beets. A large or small order includes both fillings: sauerkraut and mushroom as well as smoked potato with greens and roasted parsnips. The former was tasty enough, but the latter was a real standout, with poppy seeds in the dough and a cascade of flavors with a kick in the filling. Neither had the pillowy creaminess of traditional potato pierogie, but rather retained the distinctive textures of their own ingredients. The menu included two sandwiches, both featuring the same vegetable pâté, which was rustic to say the least: more like a soft loaf of finely ground and seasoned seeds and root vegetables. Otherwise, the sandwiches departed sharply. The Baba Jaga added Polish pickles and pickled beets, smoked-onion remoulade, and mustard atop slabs of that hearty, seedy house bread, while the Horse and Pepper went the spicy route, with horseradish slaw, pepper relish and jalapeños on a baguette. We found the Baba Jaga to be a bit one-note, the pâté serving mostly as filler, so that almost all the flavor came from the pickled cukes and beets. But the Horse had a lot more breadth and interest; it probably helped that the light, crusty baguette didn’t compete with the loaf-like pâté in the way the seedy bread did. Golumpki were a challenge to eat with the lightweight silverware provided, and have very little taste on their own. They were salvaged by the excellent, thick tomato puree they were served upon. Grilled endive was slathered in a cloying, jelly-like prune molasses. The wild mushrooms on top were roasted to perfection, however. The raw physical space Apteka occupies could read as hipster affectation, but it pretty honestly is what it is: cinder-block walls and concrete floor, lightened by a bare-wood bar and a few decorative touches, most notably flower arrangements that put carnations in a bottle to shame. Apteka demonstrates — in case there was any doubt — that in the right hands, neither vegan food nor bare-bones decor has to be austere.

Urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg coined the term “third space” in the 1990s, but these places have existed about as long as organized society. Wherever masses gathered, third spaces followed — people just may have not been aware of them. But one Garfield bakery, co-op, and teaching kitchen has that intentionality at the forefront of their business model. Beth Taylor, Erika Bruce, and Chole Newman are the founders and owners of Third Space Bakery — the first bakery to grace Penn Ave. in nearly 35 years, according to Rick Swartz, executive director of the Bloomfield Garfield Corporation. He spoke to a crowd of around 30 people at the ribbon cutting ceremony on April 12. Taylor said they chose the neighborhood because “there is so much going on and a great vibe here — an art scene, people, great craft beer.” Alongside its proximity to the lively, walkable business district on Penn Ave., the bakery borders Bloomfield, lies a few minutes up from Shadyside, has Lawrenceville down the road, and Friendship a few streets over. Jane Voros, of Shadyside, said she appreciates the bakery’s convenient location when she visited the grand opening. “Garfield is amazing,” Voros told Pittsburgh City Paper. “Pittsburgh[ers] tend to stay in their neighborhoods, so to get out is great and good for the community.” The accessibility of Penn Ave. brings additional hope to what this proud third space can offer the community, aside from European-inspired pastries, cakes and sourdough bread. Jillian Horan, another Shadyside resident, notes that, for those who don’t drink alcohol, third spaces are even more limited. “I don’t drink, so I really appreciate open spaces where I don’t feel uncomfortable and can still be social,” Horan said. “For people who are underaged … bakeries and cafes and such offer really cozy, welcoming areas.” Nil-Jana Akpinar, of Friendship, views third spaces as places “where you can spend time without spending money, without being expected to consume. [It’s] a community space.” While most people entering Third Space’s doors are spending $3 to $9 on a treat, Akpinar’s comment reflects a problem Oldenburg warns of in his writing and research: living becoming more expensive when we don’t have access to public spaces that exist outside the confines of private ownership and mass consumption. Take, for example, the decline of home economics due to school budget cuts, Taylor said. That’s created a growing population with less than basic culinary knowledge, and therefore a reliance on pre-made store meals and fast-food chain options that prioritize efficiency over quality. These options may seem momentarily economical, but, in the grand scheme, they’re costing more to your wallet and health, as well as distancing people from the food they eat. At its best, a third space offers reprieve from the bustle of life’s obligations and designates an accessible space for creativity, relaxation and sociability. But what makes this third space different from others? Dr. Michael Glass, an assistant professor of sociology and director of the Urban Studies Program at the University of Pittsburgh believes it lies within the very fabric of the business: the prioritization of collectivity and democracy. “[The cooperative aspect] gets down to what sounds like a fundamental appreciation on the part of the workers and management about what these third spaces should really be designed to do,” said Glass. And so far, that aspect is being celebrated by customers. “I’m always ready to support a co-op,” Maris Wilson of Shadyside told City Paper. And while cooperatives embrace a different environment compared to those of corporate-owned businesses and chains, it’s an avenue less taken due to obstacles. “The history of co-ops, for ages, has been agricultural co-ops … but worker-owned is a little newer to Pennsylvania, and that’s been a challenge,” Taylor said. “Even identifying as a co-op, we had to jump through some hoops for that.” Worker-ownership is few and far between, in part from lack of resources and a process that is difficult to navigate — and the cooperatives that exist are overwhelmingly credit unions. The Keystone Development Center, a nonprofit that helps establish cooperatives in PA, reports 707 cooperatives in the state — yet only 50 of those have been established since 2000. And of the 707 businesses, only 15 are food cooperatives and 48 agricultural. Meanwhile, as of 2022, 39.5% of Pennsylvania small businesses were owned by women. Third Space Bakery took these numbers as a challenge to do their business differently. They've sought to lay the groundwork so other businesses can follow suit. “All of us, having worked under other people, wanted to collaborate more together, as well as give our workers an opportunity to be a part of the business,” Taylor said. “We decided to bite the bullet.” They're trying to lead with transparency and want to give their employees a vote in how the business is run. click to enlarge CP Photo: Grace DeLallo Chloe Newman and Erika Bruce prepare baked goods in Third Space’s kitchen. And thanks to the KDC and Maura Rapkin of Napkin LLC, who helps food-related businesses get up and running, Taylor, Bruce, and Newman didn’t have to navigate the tedious system independently. Nearly two years after they dreamed up this idea, they are ready to bring people as patrons and participants. Third Space Bakery sports a teaching kitchen offering a multitude of cooking and baking classes that will only increase with time, varying from cooking recipes from a Persian cookbook, to a two-part class on how to bake sourdough, to a course on how to work with choux pastry — a vision originating from Taylor’s ardent instructional enthusiasm. “In my heart, it’s always very important that people learn to cook and to cook for themselves for a multitude of reasons, just from the confidence and pleasure it brings and connection over the food,” Taylor said. “But I also love seeing, at the end of a class, people sitting down and breaking bread together over this meal that they’ve made.” And that excitement and authenticity translates to those entering through the business’ doors. “That focus on community is what makes the teaching portion really important to me,” Wilson said. “It’s like, let’s build up these skills together.” And what better forum for Pittsburghers on the East End, and possibly those across the city, to gather in than one centered around something we all share in common? Glass says the model offers an opportunity to share timeless traditions and form authentic community. “Name a culture that doesn’t have some sort of baking-based heritage,” he said. “It seems like an incredibly democratic way to move forward.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Food, Third Space Bakery Related Content Pre-order the perfect Thanksgiving with these Pittsburgh meal kits, desserts, and more By Rachel Wilkinson Nov 8, 2024 A new brewery at Hough’s, a surprise Station Square shutdown, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Sep 24, 2024 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: The Talent Group, Chatham University, American Eagle, and more By Morgan Biddle Apr 15, 2024 Baseball bites, culinary classes, vying IPAs, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Apr 2, 2024 Latest in Food What is the best pierogi at Polska Laska?

Walk into any local brewery, and you’ll notice its differences: in the menu, atmosphere, and what it's trying to represent. And sometimes, like during my recent visit to Coven Brewing, you just walk in and say, “Holy shit, this is some good beer.” Coven has immediately established itself as one of the very best producers of beer in the city. The new brewery, which took over Roundabout Brewery’s old lease in February, officially opened for service on April 6 in Lawrenceville. The taproom space is simple, in the best way possible. The focus here is togetherness, and the intimate setting works for it. You still feel the traces of Roundabout’s pioneering taproom, but Coven has modified it with some sleek touches, and the patio is still fully functioning as a great gathering spot. However, Coven isn't reinventing the wheel of what it means to be a brewery. What it is doing is focusing on high-quality beers and the service to enjoy them properly. And the early returns are stellar with an initial draft list containing three Coven beers. “Curses in Cursive,” a 7.2% saison, was the first one I tried. A notoriously tricky style to nail, this beer was pulled off effortlessly, a debut beer that didn’t feel like one. It leans further into the fruity, hoppy ends of the style as opposed to the funky and wild elements of some saisons, creating a beer that feels light enough to crush throughout the springtime, yet complex and high enough in ABV to still pack a punch. Next up was Freestanding Plinths, a 5.8% pale ale and probably my favorite beer of the evening. A pale is always tricky because it’s such a ubiquitous style. What more can you offer in such a crowded field? Well, it turns out you can offer up one of the best examples of the style in Pittsburgh, a beer that feels like it will be a draft staple far into the future. Dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin, Simcoe, and Hallertau Blanc, plinths give huge fruity notes, all grapefruit and juice. Coven’s version is so smooth, it's almost comical. Finally, there was Swanky, a 6.8% IPA. Coven is going to be heavily focused on its IPA program — after all, its owners Trevor Greer and Caiti Sullivan come from local IPA giant Dancing Gnome brewery in Sharpsburg — and it's easy to know why when tasting this beer. Swanky doesn’t do anything too crazy, it just drives home its balance of drinkability and hop-forward expressiveness. Coven will continue to evolve as a brewery, in its beer and in who they are and what they do as a taproom space in a busy part of the city. But for a place to come so fully formed, so confident and defined in its work during opening week, is a testament to the owners spending years at the craft in anticipation of this moment. If this is the opening draft list, I absolutely can’t wait to see what’s next.Coven Brewing. 4901 Butler St., Lawrenceville.

Flannel-clad locals, some cradling frothy pints, and families form a winding line as the aroma of sizzling carnitas and freshly pressed tortillas fills the air. Behind the food truck’s window, Jesús Martinez, co-founder of La Palapa, smiles as he hands a freshly wrapped tamale to a customer, and seamlessly goes back to flipping tortillas for the next hungry patron. “I can’t help myself. I still love it, you know?” You’ve likely encountered La Palapa’s vibrant food truck making the rounds at Pittsburgh’s favorite breweries serving an assortment of tacos, tamales, flautas, and enchiladas. While Martinez no longer cooks or serves daily—his talented team has that covered—there are moments when the intoxicating scent of masa and chili lures him back to the grill. “Some days, when we’re short-handed or the crew is stretched thin, I find myself jumping in,” he tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “There’s something about the kitchen's energy that pulls me back. You get caught up in the rhythm — the sounds, the smells. It’s hard to resist.” La Palapa has evolved significantly since its humble beginnings at the since-shuttered Pittsburgh Public Market. Alongside two thriving food trucks, La Palapa now boasts a lively restaurant and mezcal bar on the South Side and a prominent presence in Lawrence Hall, a new food hall that opened in Lawrenceville earlier this year. “Did I always want to be in the food business?” Martinez muses. “I don’t know if that was the plan.” Yet, in retrospect, it seems almost inevitable. Food was always central to Martinez’s family life. “In my family, everything revolved around the kitchen table,” he shares. “My mom was an incredible cook. She made picadillo, pozole, and, of course, tamales — not the kind you think of here, but the real deal, with fresh masa and all the trimmings.” With sisters pursuing food chemistry, it was only natural for Martinez to follow suit, earning a degree in food engineering from Universidad de México in Mexico City. However, a desk job was never in the cards for him. “I think I’ve always been like that — never sitting still. I knew I loved food but didn’t know what I’d do in terms of a food career,” he reflects. After seven years of teaching scuba diving, Martinez eventually found himself in Pittsburgh. During this time, he explored Mexico’s vast culinary landscape, savoring dishes from every corner of the country — think Oaxaca’s mole, Veracruz’s seafood, and hearty San Luis Potosí specialties. “Tamales are a staple in Mexico City. You find them everywhere. A typical breakfast in college was a tamal with a hot drink called atole, which is also made from corn masa,” Martinez recalls. It was these authentic tamales that propelled La Palapa into the Pittsburgh spotlight. Martinez landed in Pittsburgh in 2012 through his son’s mother, who hailed from the city. But when he first arrived? “I couldn’t even find a decent tortilla,” he says. So, what does a guy do when the flavors of home are nowhere to be found? He builds it from scratch. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of La Palapa Jesús Martinez Starting with a modest 100-square-foot stall at public market, Martinez set out to change the game. His stall was unassuming — a simple counter and a grill — but what it lacked in flair, it more than made up for in flavor. Martinez introduced Pittsburghers to dishes many had never tasted before: tamales filled with spiced pork, hearty enchiladas, and tacos made with fresh, handmade tortillas, a rarity at the time. The initial success came fast and furious. Pittsburgh was hungry for something different, something authentic, and they flocked to Martinez’s stall. “The Public Market was a testing ground for us,” he explains. “People loved what we were doing, and it gave us a chance to meet so many customers, many of whom are still loyal today.” A year later, La Palapa opened its first brick-and-mortar location in the South Side, a small 20-seat spot. It was tiny, seating only 20, but the food was big. That expansion included traditional dishes like chicken mole and lamb shank in adobo, which quickly became customer favorites. And as demand grew, so did Martinez’s desire to shake things up. His next move? Hitting the road with a food truck. By 2015, La Palapa was mobile, bringing its authentic Mexican dishes to breweries, festivals, and private parties throughout the city. “The food truck gave me the freedom to move, to take our food to people who might not come all the way to the South Side. It’s like free marketing — we’re a rolling billboard.” The truck soon became a beloved fixture at Pittsburgh's breweries. Its simple menu delighted patrons, but it was the quality of the ingredients that kept them returning. “We don’t take shortcuts,” Martinez says. “The tortillas are always fresh, the meats are slow-cooked, and the flavors are exactly like you’d find back home.” In 2018, Martinez moved La Palapa into a larger space on East Carson Street, accommodating 120 diners and introducing a liquor license to the mix. The South Side restaurant embodies its namesake — “La Palapa,” meaning an open-sided structure with a palm-thatched roof — through its bright, airy layout and spacious patio, creating a tropical, laid-back vibe. The mezcal bar serves as a focal point, featuring an array of artisanal spirits that Martinez carefully curates. Since then, La Palapa has launched a second food truck and became a key vendor at Lawrence Hall in 2024, keeping the momentum of its growth strong. As the last taco of the night goes out and the line dwindles, Martinez steps back, watching his team close up. It’s hard work, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. The food truck rolls on to its next destination, much like Martinez himself—never still, always looking forward, and always ready to serve up the vibrant flavors of home.

This happens after a few beers or a couple of cocktails have made you want to share an experience with the friends you suddenly, effusively love so much, man! But what to order — a bar menu might offer sweet, suggestively named selections for birthday girls and bachelorette parties, and boilermakers for the no-fuss, shot-and-beer crowd. Purists may order it straight, but where’s the fun in that? Then there’s the pickleback. In Pittsburgh — a town nationally regarded for its annual brine-infused specialty food festival and signature Heinz pickle pins — the combo of brown liquor and pickle juice just fits. Drinkers wash down the heavy flavor of whiskey, traditionally served as part of this iconic duo, with a pleasantly sour wave of pickle juice, often giving way to a visceral reaction between disgusted and exhilarated. However, not all picklebacks are the same — one spot might serve a straightforward version, while another might experiment with unexpected flavors. Pittsburgh City Paper took a pickleback tour of the city to see how various local bars approach this off-beat boozy treat. Belvedere’s Ultra-Dive 4016 Butler St., Lawrenceville. belvederesultradive.com My first pickleback came from this Lawrenceville mainstay, and I’m glad it did, because otherwise, I doubt I would have continued drinking them. While I can’t remember the exact scenario, I imagine it was during a break from dancing at one of many ’80s Nights, after I’d had a few beers and wanted a little something more. Perhaps this fond memory makes the Belvedere’s pickleback special and, for me, sets the standard for this distinctive shot. It’s a straightforward, unpretentious option combining Jameson with classic, brine-forward, locally sourced pickle juice that still carries hints of the cucumbers from which it came. Fans of clear liquor will find it also goes well with vodka. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Butterjoint pickleback Butterjoint 208 N. Craig St., Oakland. butterjoint.com Butterjoint boosts its warm, classically styled bar area with a menu of creative and classic cocktails. Its pickleback pairs Old Grand-Dad Bonded whiskey with housemade pickle juice, providing a signature experience that doesn’t stray from the formula people know and love. The pickle juice tastes — and I mean this in the best way — like the cellar in which it was created, resulting in an earthier, less brine-forward, more nuanced creation. It doesn’t cut through the alcoholic taste of the whiskey as much as it complements it, leaving an aftertaste best described as thick and comforting. It’s not your granddad's (wink, wink) pickleback, but it does deliver. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Commerce Bar pickleback Commerce Bar 128 S. Highland Ave., East Liberty. instagram.com/commercebarpgh This dark, sexy speakeasy, tucked in an alley by the back of a Goodwill, looks more likely to serve only the fanciest, most elegant cocktails in delicate glassware similar to the kind your grandmother only broke out for special occasions. Imagine my surprise when the menu featured not one, but two picklebacks, one with bourbon and one with tequila. In truth, I expected something elevated, maybe even a smidge pretentious. Instead, I got a chilled shot straight out of the Vlassic jar. This is the camel-colored coat of picklebacks — classic, clean, and goes with everything, the best option for introducing pickleback first-timers to the magical world of liquor and brine. Try it on your next date. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Spirit pickleback Spirit 242 51st St., Lawrenceville. spiritpgh.com Nothing invites pickleback consumption like partying in a former Moose Lodge, especially when the proprietors did their best to retain and incorporate the site’s laid-back, working-class social club aesthetic. Spirit adds to this atmosphere with a menu of unfussy, yet innovative cocktails, beer, and various other libations, including a distinctive “quality house bourbon” and “house pickle brine.” When describing the Spirit pickleback, the term “a lot” comes to mind. It packs a sweet, spicy, garlicky punch of flavor that often leaves me shaking my head like a baby who just tried a lemon for the first time. Even so, it chases the bourbon well, resulting in a surprisingly smooth finish. While this pickleback may not appeal to me (I’m not crazy about garlic), anyone looking for a bold, zesty option that deviates from the usual jar juice would be remiss to not at least try it. Tina's 4114 Main St., Bloomfield. tinaspgh.com Tina’s has experienced a bit of an identity crisis in the wake of COVID, and not in a bad way — the cocktail bar has transformed somewhat, adding a bottle shop and tinned fish menu to its usual selection of bar snacks and tasty drinks. The Tina’s beverage list extends beyond fancier options with an inexpensive tequila pickleback. However, don’t be fooled by the dainty shot glasses in which this is served — this is a spicy boy with attitude, a sassy little baby that will not be ignored. Much like Spirit’s pickleback, some may find the flavor overbearing or unpleasant, making it an acquired taste. Regardless, it matches perfectly with the tequila, and the kick of heat sets it apart from its pickleback peers.

Tinned fish, canned seafood, or conserva are terms for seafood and other edibles preserved in water or oil, sometimes with additional seasoning, often at the height of the product’s freshness. Popular all over the world but especially in the Mediterranean, tinned fish has swum out of the Continental pantry and into the global food world’s embrace. Tinned fish began appearing in American restaurants in the early 2010s, capitalizing on a Euro-chic cachet that caught on as more Americans visited the conserva consumption hubs of Spain and Portugal. The pandemic took the trend into our homes, where scrappy TikTokers praised the shelf-stable product for adding a little luxury and wanderlust to our isolation-bound diets. Today, the tinned fish industry is projected to reach over $11.3 billion dollars by 2027. Its appeal is manifold. The packaging is a design fan’s dream, from the old-school simplicity of Cento’s yellow cans to the delightfully absurdist illustrations of José Gourmet and beyond. Tinned fish is collectible, giftable, and affordable-ish relative to other luxury items. It’s a way of having a trendy moment without it becoming a deeply spendy moment, though buyer beware — stocking up on conserva can quickly become habit-forming. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson De Fer Coffee & Tea in the Strip District offers a wide variety of conserva, including preserved tuna, mackerel, and smoked mussels. Tinned seafood does have immaculate vibes, all the more appealing because it swims in contradictory waters where the accessible meets the aspirational. It’s a little grandpa chic, a little “girl dinner.” Eating out of a can has a “rat summer” ethos, but it also says “Why yes, I have walked the Camino!” It’s great for a solo dinner but can scale to feed a crowd. It can play co-star to charcuterie and cheese or shine on its own. The product is endlessly riff-able. I first grew to appreciate this seafood delivery system not from TikTok or a trip to Barcelona, but right here in Pittsburgh at Tina’s Cocktail Bar and Bottle Shop, where owner Sarah Shaffer has hosted a food program prominently featuring tinned fish since 2020. Shaffer tells CP the major impetus for serving tinned fish was to match Tina’s biodynamic wine program, not just in flavor, but in philosophy. “What was at the forefront of my reasoning for moving to tinned fish was sustainability. I want to be really clear, this is sustainability in terms of sustainable waste management. Tinned fish, in theory, is a way of shelf-stabilizing food, so you're minimizing food waste. Its packaging can be first-person recycled, so we personally compost the boxes and we first-hand recycle the tins.” Tina’s will be evolving their tinned fish offerings around August to further emphasize sustainability. “What you might see in the next few months is a much smaller offering of tinned fish,” says Shaffer, “but it’s going to be from canneries that are focusing on healthy farming, healthy collection of fish, and really understanding their impact on the environment around them ... I want people to know that if they’re concerned about the current state of environmental stress, that’s something very important here at Tina’s. We’re interested in supporting the conscious consumers in our community.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Tinned fish at De Fer Coffee & Tea in the Strip District Shaffer mentions the encouragement of former staff member Elina Malkin as instrumental in bringing conserva to Tina’s. “She was a big part of the supporting factor that welcomed tinned fish into the program. It was with her I had my first can of tinned fish, and the entire concept grew from there,” says Shaffer. Initial reception from patrons, however, was mixed. Some approached with enthusiasm, and others, skepticism. “Customers would come in and joke, ‘I don’t want to smell like sardines all night, so I can’t eat tinned fish.’ You’re not going to smell like sardines! It doesn’t smell like fish when you come into Tina’s, and there are more cracked cans of tinned fish here than in any place in the city!” But over 2022-2023, Shaffer began to see more excitement for the program, and now, “people are coming in with curiosity and respect, which always feels nice.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Inside Tina’s Cocktail Bar and Bottle Shop If you’d like to dip your toe in the tinned fish waters, cans of conserva are available at many places in Pittsburgh, as well as online. Tina’s currently sells unopened conserva to customers, and will be expanding their retail offerings in the coming months as part of their online bottle shop. De Fer Coffee & Tea and Wholey’s in the Strip District offer curated conserva, but you can also find tinned seafood right where you think it’d be, in the canned sections of Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, or Giant Eagle. Conserva that’s packaged with tomatoes, lemons, herbs, or other flavorings can also temper the fishiness, and smoked tinned fish is a great way to bridge the gap between a familiar flavor profile and an unknown product. I prefer tinned seafood served with something acidic to balance the preserving oil— think citrus, vinegar-based hot sauce, or pickled vegetables. Bread, crackers, or even lettuce wraps can serve as a carrier for your conserva; pair it with cheese and you have infinite bites to play with. To level up your tinned fish game, you can plunk it on salad or toast, mix it into dips, toss into pasta for a pantry-staple dinner, have some tinned salmon with eggs like Shaffer does, or add shellfish to soups for extra protein. One of the more compelling recipes I’ve seen is for a “poor man’s Oysters Rockefeller” using smoked oysters covered in butter and cheese and broiled and eaten (carefully) right in the tin. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Tinned fish at De Fer Coffee & Tea in the Strip District Hopefully, the trendiness of tinned fish, particularly in Pittsburgh, will transform into something with legs. As Shaffer says, “I think it’s important to identify what is trendy about it … It gives this energy of ‘I’ve been able to travel and I see tinned fish as a way to eat something high in protein, light on the stomach, you drink it with wine’ — it’s a lifestyle idea, if you will. “Being someone who is blessed enough to be able to spend time in Europe, I will say that absolutely, tinned fish is a big part of cuisine there, but it’s not a glamorous thing, it’s not a trendy thing; it’s a way to feed a lot of Europeans with the renewable or accessible resource they have ... Tinned fish is actually preserving fish at their peak and providing the highest quality of fish for the longest period.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Food, De Fer Coffee & Tea, Tina’s Cocktail Bar, Sarah Shaffer Related Content The best jukebox bars in Pittsburgh By CP Staff Nov 13, 2023 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Pizza Makers, Digital Design Manager, and more Compiled by Lisa Cunningham Aug 7, 2022 Seven Pittsburgh coffee shops serving tea lattes or steamers By Dani Janae Jan 26, 2022 Eight refreshing Pittsburgh drinks mixing coffee and fruit that are perfect for summer By Lauryn Nania Jun 18, 2021 Latest in Food What is the best pierogi at Polska Laska?

Light and well vodka should be Pittsburgh's \"special\" By Amanda Waltz click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz I.C. Light and well vodka at Spirit My Pittsburgh City Paper co-workers have made their drink preferences pretty clear. Staff writer Rachel Wilkinson wants that trash, that sweet, that sugary combination of artificially flavored vodkas, unnaturally bright colors, and candy accouterments. News editor Colin Williams gets what he wants by homebrewing his craft beer and enjoys exploring what local breweries have to offer. But what about Mandy Waltz? As someone who grew up in a dry household — a product of my cowboy father's general sobriety after years of drinking his way across Texas — my views on alcohol would be best described as indifferent. When I turned 21, I decided Bloody Marys would be my signature drink, the genius reason being that I like tomatoes. This lasted exactly one Bloody Mary, ordered during my grandmother's birthday dinner. When I became a club rat, I sampled a long list of shots, cocktails, and beers trying to find what would best allow me to dance all night without flop-sweating through my going-out top. First, it was Jägerbombs, followed by cranberry vodkas, high-ABV Golden Monkey beer, Straub, and the grapefruity goodness of Greyhounds, which left me with an eye infection after I passed out in my cheap, probably expired drugstore makeup. Finally, I found the perfect formula. My night usually begins with an I.C. Light and a shot of well vodka, and from there, I stick with bottles or cans of I.C. Light only. If the vibes peak, I may have a second shot, but no more. The I.C. Light/bottom-shelf vodka combo offers numerous perks, the top two being it's relatively inexpensive and never leaves me with a hangover. Despite the sideways looks I get from craft beer fans and liquor snobs when declaring my loyalty to what I've dubbed \"The Amanda,\" almost 20 years of drinking it with few to no bad outcomes can't be wrong. When telling a partner about The Amanda, he brought something up that I had never heard before — if you go to a bar in any American city and order \"the special,\" you receive an off-menu item that best reflects the region's character, usually a locally made beer or spirit. To be fair, I found no evidence to back up this claim, but for the sake of this piece, I'm willing to believe Chicago bars are slinging Malört to open-minded travelers, and visitors to Baltimore are getting their first taste of Natty Boh. Given that Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the company behind I.C. Light, was founded and has operated out of southwestern Pennsylvania since 1861, there is no better beer to represent the region. Pairing it with a liquor best described as \"practical\" harkens back to the city's blue-collar days of communal, post-work drinking, before $15 cocktails and taprooms crowded with high ABV-loving haze boys became the norm. Even better, once the warm weather hits, you have the option of subbing in a refreshing I.C. Light Mango. So please, when considering how to best promote Pittsburgh through alcohol, consider getting tourists somewhat buzzed on a low-carb, low-calorie lager and vodka stored in a plastic jug. Calling it The Amanda is optional. Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Drink, I.C.

I use this phrase with as much affection as possible, as I’ve spent years pursuing the best drinks in this category and having a lot of fun doing it. I’ll be the one to say it — most alcohol tastes bad. I feel as if I’ve spent most of my adult life being gaslit about this fact, and for me, reaching drinking age as the millennial-fueled craft beer boom hit was a nightmare. As far as liquor goes, the cheap stuff burns, the higher-end selections always leave me wanting, and as someone who still craves the occasional buzz, I’ve always preferred the most palatable drinks possible, which for me haven’t evolved much since my Smirnoff Vodka college days. Much like the famous Supreme Court pronouncement, when it comes to a Trashy Drink, you know it when you see it. Trashy Drinks look like fun in a glass: we’re talking neon Lite-Brite colors, whipped cream and candy toppings, and maybe even a plastic toy for a garnish. They’re often tropical and evoke the beach, or MTV Spring Break. Before anyone (rightfully) criticizes my underdeveloped palate, know that for the sake of existing in polite society, I’ve learned to enjoy a light beer like a hefeweizen or an unoffensive pilsner, and even a fancy cocktail (of which there are many in Pittsburgh). But I offer this counter: as a hardworking adult, why wouldn’t you treat yourself to the kind of sugary dessert drink you dreamt of as a child? When did you give up the ghost and let the dream die? For those who still want to drink with whimsy, wonder, and more than a few sweeteners, I’ve compiled a list of my favorite trashy drinks in Pittsburgh. Hemingway’s Cafe 3911 Forbes Ave., Oakland. hemingwayspgh.com As many lament the homogenization of Oakland and the loss of restaurants around the University of Pittsburgh campus, Hemingway’s deserves praise for remaining an institution and for keeping its rainbow of mixed drink pitchers front and center. Famously topping its pitchers and a bevy of other fluorescent drinks with gummy worms, candy necklaces, and other confections, Hem’s stays a Trashy Drink mecca. It wasn’t always this way — opened in 1983 by a former Pittsburgh Pirates player, the bar was once a white tablecloth establishment. But as a Pitt alumna, I treasure Hem’s as a classic college bar serving cheap drinks with dangerously little alcohol flavor, happy hour specials, and “munchies” like grilled cheese, burgers, and sweet potato tots to soak up whatever decision you make. Sandbar at Sandcastle 1000 Sandcastle Dr., Homestead. sandcastlewaterpark.com An oasis behind a Costco, Sandcastle is generally underrated. Not only can you waterslide into a Dragon’s Den, but at Pittsburgh’s hometown waterpark (as it’s billed), you can do it tipsy off some of the finest frozen drinks. The frozen margarita, pina colada, and alcoholic slushy are all Trashy Drink staples in my book — especially consumed beach- or poolside. Not only does Sandcastle serve these drinks along its boardwalk, but you can grab them at Sandbar, located right by a pool and the park's cabanas. Does the park look straight out of the ‘70s and is it staffed largely by indifferent teenagers? That’s all part of the experience. All we need now is a swim-up bar. Pins Mechanical Co. 407 Cinema Dr., South Side. pinsbar.com/locations/pittsburgh College bars and waterparks are natural Trashy Drink hubs, but a newer venue, the adult arcade, has brought a wonderland of new libations with it. Pins Mechanical, the South Side “adult playground” opened in 2022, currently features “patio favorites” that include a cooler of Patio Punch and four flavors of boozy shaved ice cocktails. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Rise Brands Shaved Ice Cocktails at Pins Mechanical I asked the bartender which shaved ice flavor was the best, to which he replied, “I’m not one of those people that likes sugary drinks, but it’s the red one.” (He was right.) Pins’ year-round cocktail menu touts all manner of nostalgically-themed colorful drinks with candy skewers, including the Hulk Hogan (blueberry vodka, lemonade, and a red-white-and-blue popsicle) and Game Over, a 25-ounce jar of “eight totally wicked liquors,” Sprite, lemonade, and Hawaiian punch — and you get to keep the glass. Cart one of those around while playing the ring toss and enter Trashy Drink heaven. Shorty’s 244 W. Bridge St., Homestead and 353 N. Shore Dr., North Side. shortysx.com Another “retro-tainment” entry, Shorty’s invites Pittsburghers to two locations for old-timey games, patio dining, and, most importantly, shots and craft cocktails with names like Pink Drink (made with wonderfully trashy watermelon Pucker liqueur, lime, and agave). I’d always had high hopes for Shorty’s Waterfront location, where guests are greeted at the entrance by a big inflatable duck. I knew we’d come to the right place when the bartender said, “Most of our shots and cocktails are sweet.” Shorty’s has some show-stopping Trashy Drinks, headlined by the bright green Sour Gummy Worm. Served in a supersized goblet, the Long Island-style drink offers near-bottomless sips of batched alcohol with lemon, lime, agave, and orange, all topped with gummy worms. The floating Jelly Donut shot, laced with Chambord raspberry liqueur and Bailey’s, tastes like an adult version of its namesake. If you need to get trashy at brunch, the most alcohol-forward drink in the bunch was a bright blue Froot Loop shot, made with RumChata, Blue Curacao, and vanilla vodka, and garnished with a skewer of Froot Loops cereal (Shorty's recommends reliving those childhood days of drinking cereal milk out of the bowl by dipping the skewer into the drink). Because slushies are a must for a trashy summer, my favorite was the Cherry Limeade, which conjured up frozen Minute Maid in the best way with cherry vodka, lime, lemonade, sours, demerara, and grenadine. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Red Lobster Red Lobster Mocha Espresso Martini Red Lobster 4766 McKnight Rd., Ross Township. redlobster.com This list is tragically light on the originator of the Trashy Drink, the chain restaurant, and I’d be remiss not to include one. Perhaps my all-time favorite Trashy Drink is Red Lobster’s Mocha Espresso Martini. This drink has gone by several names over the years, though it was most recently resurrected for Lobsterfest. Described in a press release as “Red Lobster's chocolatey take on a modern classic,” the drink includes RumChata, Disaronno amaretto, and espresso, and comes garnished with a brownie bite chunk and possibly a strawberry. The key element here is that it’s a drink that’s unapologetically brimming with chocolate — earlier iterations slathered on chocolate syrup — and you can drink it before dinner. Red Lobster might not be with us for much longer, so enjoy their full lineup of certified Trashy Drink martinis (they even rolled watermelon out for summer).

Picture it — Syracuse, 2010. I leave the comfort of Pittsburgh and drive the width of Pennsylvania to complete an orientation for my master’s program at Syracuse University. The Central New York town known for its snow and salt potatoes (literally spuds cooked in extra salty water) has yet to impress me. Luckily, a friend who just so happened to be attending SU at the time took me on a tour that included a visit to something I had never experienced before — a revolving sushi restaurant. We sat in the bar area as small plates covered with plastic domes slowly moved past us, offering a variety of maki, nigiri, and other delicacies, as well as seaweed salad and desserts. The restaurant, Sakana-Ya, still operates to this day (I even found a few recent YouTube videos reviewing it). Upon moving back to Pittsburgh, a city more populated and exciting than Syracuse (sorry/not sorry, feel free to meet me in the parking lot after school), I felt a bit cheated. While my adopted home features several fine sushi establishments, I couldn’t help but wonder why we lacked one with a conveyor belt. Plus, if Syracuse can sustain one, we definitely can. Imagine my excitement when Kura Sushi USA, described as an “innovative and tech interactive” Japanese restaurant chain, announced the launch of a location in the SouthSide Works. The SouthSide Works Kura, which opened in October, adds to the aggressive redevelopment and reinvention of the South Side shopping and entertainment district that has unfolded over the past several years — for context, Kura now sits beside Pins Mechanical, a two-story adult arcade that debuted in 2021, and just a few doors down from the new Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams scoop shop. click to enlarge Mars Johnson Kura Revolving Sushi Bar opened its doors in September in Pittsburgh's SouthSide Works. Revolving sushi restaurants have existed since the late 1950s — according to Wikipedia, the first one opened in Higashiōsaka, a city located in Japan’s Osaka Prefecture — and, over the past several decades, have slowly expanded beyond their country of origin. Established in 2008 as a subsidiary of the Japan-based Kura Sushi Inc., Kura Sushi USA has brought the concept to cities in California, Illinois, Florida, and other states — currently, Pennsylvania boasts locations in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Given my vegetarianism, I decided to recruit a meat eater to cover as much sushi ground as possible. Walking in, I was struck by the lack of decor — besides a handful of posters for the anime series Jujitsu Kaisen, I was otherwise surrounded by sterile white walls. One aspect that differed from my previous revolving sushi experience was the layout — unlike in Syracuse, where diners are limited to sitting at an open bar area, Kura offers two sets of booth seating areas, each one surrounding respective conveyor belts. Yes, belts, plural — one offers a continuous string of tiny sushi plates while another “express belt” quickly delivers food ordered on a computer screen provided in each booth. My partner and I tried several dishes that spoke to the restaurant prioritizing novelty over taste. As expected, the majority of the bite-size dishes — most priced at a more than reasonable $3.65 a pop — feature fish, with a few beef selections in rotation as well. My partner tried the crispy rice with spicy tuna, seared eel with miso cream cheese nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and California roll. Overall, he seemed less than blown away, but happily ate the seared eel and both rolls (the various emotions he displayed while trying the crispy rice, however, suggested he was more on the fence with that one.) As for the vegetarian selections, I tried two cucumber-based dishes — one salad and one roll — and found them both tasty enough. When the inari, balls of rice wrapped in pockets of thin tofu, failed to show up, I ordered one, along with a bowl of kitsune udon. The udon, with its thick noodles, two slabs of tofu, salty broth, and green onions, was hearty and satisfying. The inari stood out as my favorite of the night, a pleasant little treat defined by a bright sweetness and filling rice. click to enlarge Mars Johnson Salmon Nigiri from Kura Sushi in the SouthSide Works. My partner and I came to a consensus on the desserts we ordered, and would gladly return for the fried sesame balls and warabimochi, bits of chewy, chilled, jelly-like mochi covered in soybean powder. Oh yeah, did I mention the robots? While various humans staff the South Side Kura, from the back-of-house sushi makers to the hosts, anyone ordering drinks will meet the restaurant’s automated members, who roll around playing what’s best described as generic rock music (my partner compared it to the fictional Mouserat band on the NBC series Parks and Recreation). Any criticisms about Kura are dashed by the childlike wonder elicited by its various ridiculous components — the robotic waitstaff, the weird joy of watching a bowl of soup rush down the express belt, the little bikkura pon prizes earned by Kura rewards members. The quality of the food mattered little to the many families, couples, and college-age Asian diners who occupied the other booths during my visit. Like me, they were looking for more than sushi — they were looking for an experience, something Kura is more than happy to deliver.

Could the brand and its ill-fated Greenfield outpost be resurrected? By Rachel Wilkinson click to enlarge CP Photo: Lucy Chen Necromancer Brewing Co. Necromancer Brewing Co. caused a stir two weeks ago when the business unexpectedly announced it would close. A Feb. 19 Instagram post stated the brewery would shutter its Ross Township taproom after nearly three years in operation and cease renovations at Midnight Whistler Pub, a second location slated to open in the former Hough’s Taproom in Greenfield. The announcement was immediately met with an outpouring of support for Necromancer’s now-former staff — who have set up a virtual tip jar — sadness at the loss of the brewery and its distinct concept, and lingering questions about the suddenness of the closure, particularly amid expansion efforts. According to head brewer Lauren Hughes, the closure “kind of caught us out of the blue.” Hughes said employees were mostly notified on the Friday before the Monday announcement. “We’re all really bummed, and myself, super bummed. I put almost four years of my life into this thing trying to make it work,” she tells Pittsburgh City Paper, noting that many of her coworkers are friends and family. “Necromancer was, I think, built on the staff. The staff was a huge part of what made Necromancer Necromancer.” Though some uncertainty surrounded the Greenfield location, which had delayed opening, Hughes did not foresee the entire business shutting down, noting “I think a lot of us, we don’t know what the inner workings of business were … at least I didn't, and I would consider myself pretty far up in the tree,” she said. “I don’t know if there’s more to the story or not.” Necromancer owner Ben Butler contends the story isn’t as strange or sordid as many imagine but, from his perspective, involves a slow financial drain and death by a thousand cuts. “The closure is this simple: we ran out of money and couldn’t continue,” Butler tells City Paper. He cites a “a perfect storm” of rising costs across the business including utilities, rent, ingredients, raw materials, and even a shrinking market as Americans drink less beer (according to one industry report, last year saw the lowest level of U.S. beer consumption in a generation). “I would challenge anyone who thinks they can do it better to try it,” he says. Speaking candidly with several media outlets, including City Paper, Butler says that he’s “tried to be as transparent as possible” about the closure, insisting that “there’s no scoop here.” In following both the coverage and internet speculation about the closure — including the original Instagram post that garnered 2,000 reactions and a Reddit post with 400 comments — he also expressed surprise at the amount of recent attention paid to him, repeatedly emphasizing his hope that Necromancer fans redirect their energy toward supporting former employees. “The one thing that I don’t want people to do is give me attention,” he tells CP. “I don't know why people are on this witch hunt right now.” “A lot of people are like, oh yeah, fuck Ben. He’s an awful person and blah, blah, blah … People should be celebrating and mourning the loss of that talent and the people that made this brand great rather than focusing on me for any particular reason, which is really weird,” Butler says. “[They should] be helping my team, supporting them and the amazing work that they did. Because all of that work is authentic; everything we did was sourced from our staff. It was their mission, [their] vision, their talents.” The brewery’s path was never conventional. Opened in March 2021, Necromancer, which specialized in brewing old-style beers, was celebrated for both the quality of its craft beers and its inclusivity, staffed largely by members of the LGBTQ community and women. CP recognized it among our People of the Year in Food and Drink in 2022, also writing in a special beer issue that the brewery had “quickly become one of Pittsburgh’s most exciting and unique spots, simultaneously resurrecting beer styles that have been forgotten while ushering in people who have been cast aside in the craft beer industry.” At the time, Hughes was one of only two female head brewers working in Pittsburgh. In May 2023, shortly after Necromancer’s second anniversary, the brewery responded to controversy over transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney promoting Bud Light by releasing its own light lager called “Even Gayer.” “Beer is for everybody. No exceptions,” a Necromancer Instagram post read. Proceeds were donated to nonprofit Gay For Good Pittsburgh, and the beer made national news. The same month, the brewery announced that Hough’s Taproom in Greenfield had “passed the torch” to Necromancer, which pledged to “put [its] spin on the bar’s very lovely bones.” Seemingly riding a high, Necromancer aimed to open British pub Midnight Whistler on September 1. Butler says, “The entire plan with Greenfield wasn’t born out of anything other than an expansion.” However, this is where the brewery’s apparent financial troubles began. Initially, the building at 563 Greenfield Ave. was “pitched as turnkey by building ownership,” according to Butler. “The building is just absolute dogshit,” he tells CP. “The ownership of Hough’s is the same people who own the building, and the building is just an utter nightmare. It’s a black hole of money. Their assistance was very minimal.” Butler stated that rather than “need[ing] some love,” as was suggested during a walkthrough, the building required near top-to-bottom renovation including new HVAC and plumbing, upgrading the electrical system, and installing glycol lines — part of the refrigeration system needed to keep draft beer cool. Hughes attests to rebuilding the draft system. A former employee who did not wish to be identified told CP that the building “also had perhaps the worst walk-in cooler I have ever seen in my decade-plus of industry experience. It was something of a doomed experiment from the start without a total renovation of the refrigeration system, which has not happened.” Compounding matters, Butler alleges Hough’s had been operating without a valid food safety permit from the Allegheny County Health Department; the same anonymous employee says they were told the former taproom had failed an inspection in May 2023, “but never bothered to fix the issues of noncompliance, knowing they intended to shutter the business in June.” ACHD records show a consultation at Hough’s on May 19, 2023 for a permit expired Jan. 31 and list it as Priority Code H, applied to facilities that have a scheduled reinspection for critical violations. Hough’s second most recent inspection in 2021 noted several violations including insufficient refrigeration and mouse droppings. Necromancer announced the building’s handover on May 24. click to enlarge CP Photo: Lucy Chen Illustrated beer cans line the wall at Necromancer Brewing Co. As work on Midnight Whistler continued, Necromancer served beer at neighborhood pop-up events and happy hours, including at nearby Alternate Histories Studio, most recently launching a Greenfield Ghoul ale there in December. Alternate Histories owner Matthew Buchholz told CP that Necromancer’s closure was “definitely a surprise to me.” “They were really great partners to work with, and I hope [their work] shows that the neighborhood is really eager for something to go into that space,” Buchholz says. Greenhouse Co-op, a plant shop and cidery opened in January, also expressed surprise. The Co-op, located at at 557 Greenfield Ave., shares a building with the now-closed pub. “Having a neighbor that serves beer, it was kind of a match made in heaven [for us],” co-owner Tammy Lee tells CP. “We were really excited to have a neighbor like Necromancer because they’re such an inclusive space and they’ve got a really fun brand.” Of the building, Lee says, “We did a fair amount of renovation work on our side … I know they were doing a lot of repair work. But no hint that it was just going to close entirely. I thought, at the worst, maybe Midnight Whistler was just going to take a lot longer than expected.” Over nearly nine months of renovation, Butler says, the investment needed to make the building operational became too “sizable.” Though there was no single tipping point, “core equipment just continued to break on a daily basis.” “The burden for resolving these issues was primarily on us, and eventually became too much,” he says. Behind the scenes, employees and neighborhood residents alike began to have concerns about the business’s future. The aforementioned unnamed employee tells CP that “by last few months of 2023, plans on the Midnight Whistler stagnated. I started to doubt whether it would open at all.” Notably, the employee says, they “had trouble getting paid at first.” The issue was resolved quickly when brought up with payroll, but “in retrospect, I suspect that the $900 or whatever they owed me was an actual strain on the business’s finances, but that’s obviously speculation.” They also reported \"snapping at any opportunity to pick up shifts\" at the Ross taproom or off-site events as work at the Greenfield location dwindled. An Instagram comment on a Nov. 29 Necromancer post referring to “unexpected challenges” at the Midnight Whistler read, “Many of us are hearing rumors (mostly on Reddit) saying the Greenfield location is not going to work out. I don’t think it would be hyperbolic to say that this would be devastating for the residents of Greenfield…” The account gave only one other update before the February closure. CP reached out to several employees with knowledge of the Midnight Whistler. One former employee declined to comment, citing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Hughes stated that she signed an NDA as part of a standard employment contract, which are not “uncommon” in the industry and protect intellectual property like beer recipes. Butler initially denied that Necromancer employees were asked to sign NDAs, clarifying that salaried employees sign confidentiality agreements upon hire, but that these were not related to the closure. A final bellwether arrived when Necromancer’s liquor license expired in December, as shown in the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board’s license data system. “I think we were all shocked about the liquor license and having to close down,” Hughes recalls. click to enlarge CP Photo: Pat Cavanagh Lauren Hughes at Necromancer Brewing Butler claims Necromancer filed their license renewal paperwork on time and the expiration also came as a shock to ownership. “We thought everything was hunky-dory until a state trooper walked in and said things weren't hunky-dory,” he tells CP. Butler suggests license renewal might be a larger problem, pointing to recent cases of businesses unexpectedly losing their liquor licenses, including Butler Brew Works, which posted about a licensing “delay” on Facebook Feb. 15. As Butler sees it, the beer business is facing steep challenges, including tightening profit margins, industry-wide. “Unfortunately, I predict more breweries will be shuttering as the cost of things just keep going up,” he tells CP. “Rising costs have especially hurt [smaller] brewers of our size where we don’t have the fortune of economies of scale, long-standing contracts, and/or endlessly deep pockets.” Operating at smaller scale, the most profitable ventures involve “selling out your front door rather than relying on distribution,” Butler says, one of aims of the Midnight Whistler expansion. Butler believes while the pub’s failure to open wasn’t Necromancer’s “death blow,” it meant the business “couldn’t produce more beer, make more money, sell food. If we could have gotten it open, I think we would be in a completely different scenario, because I have no doubt that would have been a very, very successful location that would have caused us to have to up production.” As for the future of the brand, Butler recently mentioned to NEXTpittsburgh that the Necromancer name might not be dead and still change hands. “We’re in discussions with several prospects about the future of the [Greenfield] space and/or [the] Necromancer brand,” he tells CP, adding there is no frontrunner or set timeline. At the same time, a Necromancer Brewing 2 LLC with an address in the North Hills appears in Pennsylvania’s Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations database, with an initial filing date of Feb. 7, only 12 days before the closure. “Necromancer is permanently closed,” Butler said in response, speculating the business’s withdrawn and surrendered licenses may not have been updated online. “There are no secured buyers for the brand, so no one new is forming an LLC for a transition at this time.” Butler’s LinkedIn page also lists him as Chief Marketing Officer for a cannabis competition, Best in Grass, as of January; he denies any connection to the Necromancer closure. “As you can see from my LinkedIn, throughout my entire career I've consistently [and] concurrently held multiple roles across multiple companies, so that’s nothing new,” he tells CP. Butler also owns the Franktuary food truck, Top Hat public relations agency, and Jet’s Barbershop in Wexford. As it stands, Necromancer, unable to legally serve alcohol, gave away its last cases of beer at an unofficial “funeral” at its Ross location the week of the closure — causing a run on the taproom and a traffic jam on Babcock Blvd. But beyond free beer, Butler and staff believe it speaks to the love for the Necromancer brand and what it represented, the spirit of which they and community members hope to see continued by Hughes and others in new ventures. “We’ll figure it out one way or another,” Hughes says. “We're a good group of bandits.” Owen Gabbey contributed additional reporting to this story.

Finally, after weeks of anticipation and hype, we can definitively say that IC’d Tea, the new beer from the local giants of iced tea and lager is … perfectly fine. This beer ends up being especially average, but will, understandably, be a massive hit locally due to good branding and the city’s inability to turn down anything that even vaguely reminds them that they do, in fact, live in Pittsburgh. If there are any doubts about its inevitable popularity, I went to purchase some IC’d Tea on April 12, mere hours after it was released, and the distributor was already down to two cases that were actually cold. Multiple friends said they couldn’t even get it. The beer marks a new chapter for Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the local company behind Iron City and other brands. As explained in a release, IC’d Tea is the first new product out of PBC's recently opened, 170,000-square-foot production facility in Creighton, Pa., which is where all the company's products are now being made and distributed. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Top Hat and Pittsburgh Brewing Company IC’d Tea from Turner's and Pittsburgh Brewing Company The first thing you come to realize is that the beer aims to please both sides of the two brands, and ends up a dulled-down version of each. The ideal collaboration would have been something akin to a spiked Arnold Palmer: sweet, heavy on the tea, with maybe a little malt to make you still feel like you’re still drinking a beer. Instead, IC’d Tea starts off with a semi-sweet kick, and then the carbonation and flavors (or lack thereof) of the Iron City hit you on the back end, making for a disconnected drinking experience. All this being said, I needed to experience this beer in its natural habitat. I went to my men’s league baseball practice and consumed a few more cans outside with friends in the sun (for research purposes, obviously). And I do get it. This beer is going to be wildly popular in the heat of summer, an easy drinking 4.2% ABV perfect for poolside enjoyment or at a Pirates game. Or, more accurately, it’s a beer you don’t think about until the next day when you have a massive headache from the copious amounts of sugar you just consumed. Anyway, I’m taking up a lot of pretentious words to say what could be said so beautifully, so succinctly, by a fellow Pittsburgh City Paper employee with whom I shared a can: “It tastes like the piss of a true Yinzer.\" Put that on a billboard.

Makers of Iron City Beer, the brewery was synonymous with the blue-collar city that sprung it, and had been brewing lagers, pilsners, and ales at its Lawrenceville facility for more than 140 years. But after it was bought out in 2007, the brewing eventually stopped in Pittsburgh, and production moved to Latrobe in Westmoreland County. Now, Iron City Beer is returning to Allegheny County. Not quite back to Pittsburgh, but up the Allegheny River, just about 22 minutes from Downtown in Creighton. On Feb. 3, Pittsburgh Brewing Company announced a plan to build a new brewery in the former Pittsburgh Glass Works plant, which is located along the river in northeastern Allegheny County. According to the Pittsburgh Business Times, construction crews are already working on converting the large site into a brewery. The goal for the company is to bring more control back to production of beers like Iron City, I.C. Light, and Old German. For over a decade, Iron City beers were brewed by contract bases at the old Rolling Rock brewery site in Latrobe. “While the brewery in Latrobe has been a tremendous facility to make all of our products, it will be very satisfying to be able to control our production again from start to finish,” said brewmaster Mike Carota in a statement. The Business Times reports that Pittsburgh Brewing expects to start making beer at its new facility by 2022, and eventually to ramp up production close to its historic volume when it was brewing in Pittsburgh. As for the former Iron City Beer site in Lawrenceville, it was recently closed on by the new owner of Pittsburgh Brewing, coal magnate Cliff Forest. A Pittsburgh Brewing spokesperson told the Business Times there are still plans to renovate the Lawrenceville brewery property on Liberty Avenue, including building a brewpub in the complex. Some preliminary plans for the largely vacant site also include a big mixed-use development, including housing and retail, according to Postindustrial. The site is right next to Herron Avenue Station of the MLK East Busway.

This repurposed 1890s warehouse, standing tall and brimming with history, promises to be both a gastronome’s dream and a relaxing space to unwind. Behind this ambitious venture are founders Brett Minarik and Phoebe Fraser, joined by the director of operations, Adam Harvey. The genesis The journey of Lawrence Hall traces back to a casual neighborhood stroll. Founders Brett Minarik and Phoebe Fraser chanced upon the 6,000-square-foot warehouse at 4609 Butler way back in 2017, a moment etched vividly in Minarik's memory. \"We stumbled across the warehouse one day while walking in the neighborhood and were taken by the beauty, size, and location,\" he recalls. \"We considered several ideas, including a parking garage, a market, and even self-storage, before settling on the idea of the food hall.\" Besides entrepreneurial spirit and a penchant for adaptive reuse, the founders have a profound appreciation for the neighborhood's potential. \"We felt strongly that a food hall would be a great fit, provide a sort of 'central hub,' and be the perfect combination of form and function to preserve the history of the space,\" says Minarik. Behind the scenes The trio at the helm — Fraser, Minarik, and Harvey — bring a mosaic of skills that shape the identity of Lawrence Hall. Minarik elaborates, “Phoebe, Adam, and I have unique and complementary skill sets that hit all the major facets of an operation like this. Phoebe, with her eye for detail and design, has designed a space that catches people's breath upon entry and leaves them with a new appreciation for what a food hall can be. Adam, our director of operations, has spent his entire career in hospitality and restaurant/bar operations and has experience in high-volume and fine-dining restaurants. He has pretty much done it all — from dishwasher, whole-animal butcher, fishmonger, line cook, executive chef, barista, and bartender through to independent restaurateur and bar owner-operator. My experience in business and finance allowed me to execute the fundamentals of the business, hopefully in a somewhat proficient manner. “ click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Inside Lawrence Hall An architectural ode The repurposed 1890s warehouse has a storied history as a motion picture theater and later an automotive service center. A zoning dispute that kept it from being a restaurant space posed a significant hurdle for several years, but since overcoming that, the momentum has been unstoppable. The open-concept food hall idea emerged as one that would preserve and highlight the structural beauty of the space while making it maximally available and enjoyable to the public. The defining architectural feature, the original wooden truss and beam system, became a focal point in the preservation efforts. \"Except for some cleaning — ok, a lot of cleaning — and minor repairs, they were in remarkable condition,” says Minarik. “As our structural engineer said, ‘They just don't do woodworking like that anymore.’ So, we wanted to design a space that would emphasize the trusses and bring people up close and personal with them on the mezzanine. Spacious yet intimate. We saw the rich history of the space as the perfect bridge between old and new Pittsburgh. That's also why [the bar] Dear James will have only local beers on draft — including IC Light.\" Food and drink offerings One of the distinctive features of Lawrence Hall is its array of local restaurateurs, each offering a unique culinary experience. The selection process was meticulous, notes Minarik, \"We took an 'all of the above' approach and spoke with more potential operators than we can remember — everyone from food truckers to seasoned pros. Our criteria for selection were pretty simple; we wanted to find good people who could make great food and who would work with us collaboratively. The one rule? No two kitchens serve the same cuisine.\" The result is a culinary cornucopia: LOADED with heaping burgers and inventive takes on American classics; La Palapa offering authentic Mexican street food; Cuddy's Soul Food providing a haven of heartiness and familiar goodness; and TOMA introducing refined Italian dishes. All in all, It's a delightful dilemma for food enthusiasts. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dear James, the bar at Lawrence Hall Central to Lawrence Hall's narrative is the aforementioned Dear James, the bar paying homage to Captain James Lawrence, the neighborhood's namesake. \"Naming the bar Dear James was the inspiration of our partner Adam, who imagined the bar, as the focal point of the hall, as a 'love letter' to the history of the space, the neighborhood we all call home, and its namesake. It ties into the ethos of perseverance embodied by Captain Lawrence,\" Minarik says. Drawing parallels to Lawrence's final words, \"Don't give up the ship,\" Minarik confesses, \"Our struggles were real, and it may sound cheesy, but it’s true nonetheless — we saw through all the obstacles with a dash of Captain's grit.\" click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dear James, the bar at Lawrence Hall A community-centric vision In a city teeming with dining options, Lawrence Hall aspires to set the standard for what a food hall can be. \"What sets us apart? It's not just the food; it's the experience,\" Brett emphasizes. \"We're on a mission to set a new standard for food halls, not just in Pittsburgh but beyond. Lawrence Hall is a beautiful space, steeped in a distinctive history, and exuding a robust personality. It offers phenomenal food and beverages overseen by individuals who take the guest experience seriously. These are our core tenets — it's up to the people of Pittsburgh to say if we got them right!” Lawrence Hall envisions itself as a \"central hub\" beyond being a culinary destination. \"LH will be a place people decide to meet before heading out for the evening or a place they stay for several hours to enjoy each other's company. We will also be partnering with the Boys and Girls Club of Western PA — whose office is literally right across the street — to offer a workforce development program for teens who need real-world experience to build up their resumes. As for the future, Brett quips, \"Ask us again in three years. For now, the goal is clear — to build the best damn food hall Pittsburgh has ever seen.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Food Latest in Food Yinzer Yums of Yesteryear: Friday fish \"fry\" at home By Stacy Rounds Mar 13, 2025 The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 New brunches, reopened ice cream shops, fried fish fun, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Mar 11, 2025 Hear me out: The fish is too big By Amanda Waltz Mar 10, 2025 More » More Food All Food+Drink Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Trending The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Yinzer Yums of Yesteryear: Friday fish \"fry\" at home By Stacy Rounds Mar 13, 2025 Hear me out: The fish is too big By Amanda Waltz Mar 10, 2025 New brunches, reopened ice cream shops, fried fish fun, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Mar 11, 2025 Things To Do This Week Pittsburgh’s top events:March 13-19 About Pittsburgh City Paper Contact Us CP Careers RSS Feed Advertise Submit/Promote an Event Job Listings Become a Member Get a Subscription Shop CP Store Sponsored Content Freelance Pitch Guidelines Get Our Daily Newsletter Privacy Policy © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper"

A statement posted on Feb. 12 by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh read, “In partnership with Salem’s Market and the City of Pittsburgh, we’ve learned that it’s not the right time for a full-service grocery store to be supported. We know community members are disappointed by the news of the store pausing its operations, and we share those feelings.” First announced in Oct. 2021, Salem’s took over the location of a former Shop ‘n Save supermarket in the Centre Heldman Plaza, which closed in 2019. The closure had underscored the lack of food options in the predominantly Black neighborhood, which had been without a full-scale grocery store for nearly 30 years. Salem’s, in partnership with URA, was chosen among four proposals to replace the former Shop ‘n Save. Its opening was met with optimism and praised by Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey as “a game-changer.” TribLive reported on reactions to Salem’s closure, which appeared to be abrupt. Residents and community members were “shocked and disappointed,” concerned about recent thefts, and said Salem’s departure underscores the need for greater community investment.

The season also carries a reverence for tradition, and, when it comes to dining out, there’s something to be said for eschewing Pittsburgh’s ever-changing foodie scene and instead heading to tried-and-true institutions where your grandparents gathered around a table. For the holiday season, Pittsburgh City Paper visited some of the city’s oldest restaurants, all of which have operated for more than a century. They span Gilded Age fine dining, family-owned pubs, and a beloved historic brewery — and promise to get guests in the spirit. The Original Oyster House 20 Market Sq., Downtown. originaloysterhousepittsburgh.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson At 154 years old, the Original Oyster House in Market Square claims the title for oldest bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh. One of few city commercial buildings designated as a historic landmark, the site was originally home to Bear Tavern, dating back to 1827. In true Pittsburgh small-town fashion, the late Judy O’Connor — mother of Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor — once told Oyster House owner Jen Grippo that her grandfather constructed the three-story building. The Oyster House moved into the space in 1870, and not much has changed since. The restaurant kept the original black-and-white tile — hexagonal floor tiles were laid by hand, then pounded in using a boxing glove — the mahogany bar, and tin ceiling. A hand-cranked dumbwaiter still raises and lowers plates. Lining the walls are panoramic photos from Miss America pageants courtesy of former owner “Silver Dollar Louie” Americus, who used to flick a coin at the contestant he thought should win. Posters and framed images show 154 years of patrons with a cross-section of notable visitors including President Jimmy Carter, Bruce Springsteen, wrestler Bruno Sammartino, and horror legend Tom Savini, who’s apparently still a regular. Playwright August Wilson also frequented the Oyster House, mentioning it by name in his autobiographical How I Learned What I Learned. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Oyster House in Downtown Pittsburgh click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Grippo inherited the business in 2017 from her late father, Lou Grippo, part of only five families who have owned the restaurant. In its 154 years, Jen Grippo points out, the Oyster House has seen “the highs and lows of Pittsburgh, [and] in general, the Great Depression, Spanish flu, floods, fires, folks having to leave the city because there weren’t jobs available.” A relatively recent improvement, she tells City Paper, was adding a women’s bathroom to the bar’s ground floor, since it was originally a men’s-only establishment. “This is some funny karma,” Grippo says. “Now women own [the bar] … Patience, ladies, patience!” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson People often tell her that coming to the Oyster House is like stepping into another time, and even the concept of an oyster house is from a bygone era. In the 19th century, oysters were a cheap and abundant source of protein for Americans, commonly raised and eaten in cities. Grippo says it's strange to think of the Oyster House in landlocked Pittsburgh — though at one time, there were nine locations — saying, “We get that a lot, for sure.” Sticking to its origins, the menu still offers a raw oyster option. But these days, Grippo says, “we are predominantly fried foods.” Today’s Oyster House is known for its “original” breaded oyster and “Famous” Jumbo Fish sandwich, served traditionally with only salt and pepper, and lettuce, tomato, and cheese available as 21st century add-ons. Preserving what past generations have done, Grippo believes, is key to the restaurant's longevity. “Every year we come up on another anniversary and people [ask], ‘How is it that you've done this?’ And it’s because of the tradition,” she says. “It’s because we continue to stay tied to our roots.” The community bonds are especially evident during the holidays, when out-of-towners return to the Oyster House. “There's been a lot of change that has happened in Pittsburgh, and I believe that progress and change [are] good,” Grippo tells CP. “Especially for Pittsburghers who are so ride-or-die for their city, [but] who still want to always honor their traditions and their past, I just hope that the Oyster House is one of those places that really makes them feel like they are back home for real.” Mitchell’s Pub 304 Ross St., Downtown. originalmitchells.com click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Mitchell's Pub At 119 years old, Mitchell’s Pub has also seen its fair share of history. Inside the pub, Jim Mitchell, its third-generation owner, maintains a “history wall” chronicling his grandfather’s (Papou's) immigrant journey to the United States from Vlachokerassia, Greece in 1902. Photos and documents show the boat where Constantinos Michalopoulos made the 25-day crossing to New York City, and the manifest from Ellis Island where he entered the country, Jim Mitchell says, with $12 to his name. After working at a Station Square restaurant for four years, Michalopoulos opened his own business near Pittsburgh’s former Civic Arena in 1906. Jim Mitchell says the legend goes that a sign painter couldn’t fit the name “Michalopoulos Dining Room” above the storefront, so his grandfather chose the surname Mitchell out of a city directory (the precursor to the phonebook). Mitchell’s weathered Prohibition by operating as a butcher shop — giving meat away during the Great Depression — saw World War II and the destruction of Court Place (part of redevelopment during Renaissance II), and moved to its current location at Third Ave. and Ross St. in 1977. Jim Mitchell realized his father Jim Mitchell Sr.’s longtime dream of buying the building in 1998, only two months before his death. “I got a picture of my dad holding the deed,” Mitchell tells CP. “So [my father] knew Mitchell’s would never have to move again.” click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Mitchell's Pub Second location of Mitchell's Pub click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Mitchell's Pub Mitchell's Pub Today, the pub is billed as “Downtown Pittsburgh’s original neighborhood bar,” and according to Jim Mitchell, its openhearted philosophy remains unchanged. Mitchell’s holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating family-owned restaurant within city limits. “My dad always taught me, you have good food [and] good service at a reasonable price. You take care of everybody … whether you're someone working [at] the county, or you're a judge, an attorney … construction worker, people from all walks of life … we treat everybody the same,” he says. “So it's a neighborhood bar in the city, and there are not too many left. People feel at home when they come to our place.” The restaurant is known for its “comfort foods” including the Mitchburgher Burger, scratch-made hot turkey and meatloaf, and tuna and patty melts. Twenty-four draft beers are kept on rotation, and 40-year veteran bartender Joe Bullsak, now 80 years old, was voted Best Bartender in CP’s Best Of PGH Readers’ Poll last year. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Mitchell's Pub History wall at Mitchell's Pub Mitchell says you can still catch Bullsak behind the bar on Thursdays and Fridays. For the holidays, they’ve rolled out specialty cocktails and martinis, in addition to reopening for dinner and extending their happy hour in light of a new state law. It’s heartening to see the place bustling again after COVID shutdowns, Mitchell tells CP, which prompted him to retool the bar, add new lighting, and “almost start from scratch.” “And when COVID was over, we were one of the last places standing,” Mitchell reflects. At 66, he says he still works 70-hour weeks to maintain the bar and its legacy. “Sometimes you get in the woods, you can't see the trees,” he says. “And then people say, that's something [that] you've been around that long, and they love seeing the history … Makes it worth the while, you know?” The Terrace Room at the Omni William Penn Hotel 530 William Penn Pl., Downtownomnihotels.com/hotels/pittsburgh-william-penn/dining/terrace-room click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Terrace Room at the Omni William Penn Hotel If Henry Clay Frick were to walk into the Omni William Penn on a recent afternoon, the hotel’s notorious owner would’ve found influencers at a Christmas-themed pop-up bar, the annual cleaning of the lobby’s Bohemian crystal chandeliers, and dining at The Terrace Room, nearly unchanged after 108 years. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Bob Page, Director of Sales & Marketing at Omni William Penn Hotel click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Bob Page, Director of Sales & Marketing at Omni William Penn Hotel, checks a light on one of the hotel's chandeliers One of the city’s oldest dining spots, the restaurant originally opened as The Italian Terrace alongside the hotel in 1916. It was immediately a huge draw, says Bob Page, the hotel’s area director of sales and marketing. The name and cuisine were meant to evoke the luxury of the Mediterranean country and highlight the space’s frescoes. Today, The Terrace Room is billed as offering “an incomparable ambiance,” retaining its original molded plaster ceiling, decorative woodwork with griffins, and mahogany arches. Historic photos also hang in the “bespoke room” showing earlier eras, including when a 1970s trend brought a floor-to-ceiling petrified palm tree. Perhaps the room’s most famous feature is the enormous mural across its back wall, “The Taking of Fort Pitt,” depicting the historic siege at the Point. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Terrace Room at the Omni William Penn Hotel click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Original silverware at the Terrace Room “It’s just such a beautiful room, right? … This hotel has been here so long, and it's a staple in the community,” Page tells CP. “People love the nostalgia of it.” The feeling is only magnified during the holidays, when diners seek out The Terrace Room, now decorated with Christmas trees and hanging ornaments. Page says, as much as they make of the hotel’s grandeur, staff still want The Terrace Room to feel approachable for a holiday meal. Once a white-tablecloth establishment, the linens are now gone, showcasing the room’s marble-topped tables. The Terrace Room hosts The Twelve Days of Tea which started Dec. 3, offering a special afternoon tea service “steeped in the magical flavors of the holiday season.” Guests can also book a reservation for breakfast, lunch, or weekend brunch. Penn Brewery 800 Vinial St., North Side. pennbrew.com With its deep German heritage, no one welcomes the yuletide quite like Penn Brewery. Pittsburgh’s oldest and largest brewery, the North Side institution was originally founded by Germans immigrants, including the Eberhardt and Ober families, in the 19th century. Three breweries dating back to 1848 originally operated on the site with the goal, head brewer Chris Rudolph says, to “bring German traditional beers to America.” Largely, Rudolph tells CP, that mission remains. He leads a history tour on the third Saturday of every month. Before refrigeration, brewers kept barrels of beer cool by storing them in caves carved hundreds of feet into the hillside. Inside these “lagering” caves (lager comes from the German word for storage) the simple “geothermals of the Earth” chilled the beer, maintaining a constant 55-degree temperature. Penn Brewery preserves what it describes as “a labyrinth” of the site’s original stone lagering caves and tunnels — among few left in the United States, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Visitors can view the caves and other remnants: the original cornerstone building still stands in the brewery’s beer garden; a stone “Eberhardt & Ober Brewing Co.” sign is still visible near today’s Penn Brewery archway; and there are pieces of the cooper department, where barrels were made. Though the four-story brewing complex is 176 years old, the Penn Brewery that Pittsburghers know was created in 1986. Tom Pastorius and his wife Mary Beth fixed up what was then a decaying building, and insisted on serving German food and making beer the traditional German way. In the brewhouse, Rudolph uses copper kettles, an anachronism, and flips a switchboard with German commands to mash, boil, and pump grain. Penn Brewery’s owner, Austrian-born Stefan Nitsch, who bought the business in 2021, takes things to a new level for the holidays. This year, the brewery hosts Krampusnacht on Dec. 5, bringing the horned, goat-like legend to its cityview terrace. Nitsch hints that Krampus — who haunted his childhood dreams — might hide in the lagering caves, stalking the wicked amidst a full parade and craft market, complete with a tarot card reader. The same night, the brewery will also tap its Sleigher Krampus Band Black IPA, along with a live performance by the band. For those less keen on spooky Christmas, the brewpub celebrates its seasonal St. Nikolaus Bock Brewer’s Reserve with a firkin-tapping party on Dec. 6. Diners can also brunch with Santa on Dec. 8 over prime rib and an omelet bar. All month long, Nitsch says, you can still enjoy traditional German fare like pork schnitzel and sausage in the brewery's main dining room, now decked out for Christmas. “It’s just a warm, inviting, cozy atmosphere,” Nitsch tells CP. “A lot of families coming together and probably reminiscing … There’s so much history here. People have been coming here for such a long time. There’s a lot of nostalgia. And I think that’s [a] big part of the Christmas spirit, is getting together with your loved ones, [having] a nice, cozy time, and enjoying some good food and beer — always beer.” Max’s Allegheny Tavern 537 Suismon St., North Side. maxsalleghenytavern.com Another living testament to the North Side’s German roots, Max’s Allegheny Tavern began as a grocery store nearly 175 years ago. CP recently spotlighted it as one of Pittsburgh’s most haunted restaurants — unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of overlap with the city’s oldest — and the storied building was also once home to the Farmers and Drovers Hotel (later the Hotel Rahn in 1903). Max’s current incarnation opened in 1977, and the traditional tavern has always been family-run and served Old World German food and beer. Hearty, no-frills dishes include sausage and an entire menu section dedicated to “the great schnitzels of Europe” with assorted German sides like spätzle (noodles), potato pancakes, and house-made sauerkraut. Stepping inside, visitors get a glimpse of centuries past with a hand-carved bar, solid heavy wood furnishings, and Tiffany-style lamps. Two antique five-door wooden ice boxes no longer chill beer, but are still used for storage behind the bar. Stop by for a cozy happy hour or a wintry holiday meal to get the full charm.

For those who chose joy — Colin and I — there were different reasons for celebrating the season. Colin, an Ohio native, would be happy to go all-in on some snowy day, sub-zero camping; and I’m all about the “affordable Hygge” vibe: fluffy blankets, burning logs in the fireplace, and, most of all, amazing winter foods. For tonight’s dinner, I once again turn to one of my favorite historic food columnists: Pittsburgh Courier’s own Bessie Gant. I’ve recreated her Chicken Oyster Gumbo with a few modifications — for the sake of availability, cost, efficiency, and flavor. click to enlarge The Pittsburgh Courier Bessie Gant's column from The Pittsburgh Courier, Jan. 25, 1941 The original recipe reads as follows: 1 small stewing chicken ½ beef, ground 1 cup diced okra ½ cup celery, diced very fine 3 pints water 3 dozen oysters Salt and pepper 1 onion 1 tbsp. butter 1 ½ tbsp. sassafras leaves Cut chicken for stewing. Place chicken, beef, okra, and celery in a pot. Add water and cook until meat is tender. Lift out pieces of chicken; let cook slightly; remove bones dice meat and return to the broth. Add oysters and their liquor. Brown onion in the butter in frying pan; add to soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add sassafras leaves. Cook until edges of oysters curl. Serves 6. My version substituted two ingredients: the stewing chicken was replaced with a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken, and raw oysters were replaced with canned. If you are a savvy shopper with time to browse several locally-owned international markets, you may stumble upon a stewing chicken. Stewing chickens are hens that are past their prime, so the meat is tougher and the bird is a bit smaller than a typical store-bought chicken. Stewing chickens must be cooked low and slow for several hours to tenderize the meat. It is also said that they make better broth than standard store-bought chickens. Stewing chickens are also allegedly cheaper than regular store-bought chickens. One Redditor claimed to have found some at a local international market for $2.45 apiece! However, in my search, I found stewing chickens on sale for a whopping $4 per pound. Meanwhile, my whole rotisserie chicken from Costco was $5. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Canned oysters from Aldi Raw oysters are also pretty dang pricey. I’d love to try this recipe one day with fresh oysters, but for now, I’ll settle for canned. The canned oysters at Aldi are currently $1.69 per can — each can containing a dozen oysters, compared to $1.25 per raw oyster at Giant Eagle. On top of substituting two ingredients, I also made a few other modifications. First, made my chicken broth the day before to save time. I removed all the meat before making bone broth and saved it in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator. I roasted the bones and scrap veggies (carrots, celery, onion, and shallot) at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Then, I added my roasted chicken and veggies to my Dutch oven, covered them with water, and then added salt, pepper, and a handful of fresh herbs. I brought the broth to a boil and then cut the heat down to a simmer. I let my broth simmer for six hours. I cleaned and used the same Dutch oven for the rest of the recipe (I love a one-pot dish!). First, I browned 1 lb. of ground beef. I decided to use 1 lb. instead of ½ lb. because I didn’t want to split my package of beef and because I figured the gumbo would be more robust with more meat. Then, I set the beef aside. I added my butter, diced celery, and diced onion and let those cook until softened. I added my beef back to the pot, then the chicken. Then, I added 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of seafood stock. Once the mixture began to heat up, I added a cup of canned diced okra. Then, I added my salt, pepper, and Gumbo File, which is just ground-up sassafras leaves. After simmering the mixture together for an hour, I added the canned oysters, 2 tsp. Cajun seasoning, and 2 tsp. Frank’s Red Hot. Keep in mind that these additional spices are optional. Also, if you like your gumbo thicker, you can add a simple roux to the mix. If you add roux, adjust the salt to taste. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds The finished product: Chicken Oyster Gumbo served with rice pilaf I served this gumbo with homemade rice and lentil pilaf.

The longtime bar and venue on Butler street, beloved as a universally friendly dive, struggled like most bars during the beginning of the pandemic closures. Those struggles continued and became insurmountable after Hambone's owner Jeff Holt passed away in late September at the age of 46 from unknown causes. Yesterday, Hambone's announced that it has permanently closed. According to a Facebook post, the restaurant had taken on too much debt, and the bar and venue will be put up for sheriff’s sale. We are very sad to have to tell you all. We tried, we really did.. but with the death of Jeff, the bank has made the...Posted by Hambone's on Saturday, October 10, 2020 Holt’s passing really hit Pittsburghers hard. Many people shared stories on social media and several spoke to Pittsburgh City Paper about his role at the helm of Hambone's. The bar was also well-known as a venue for emerging entertainers in comedy, burlesque, and music to get their start playing live shows in Pittsburgh. “Jeff was an artist who created a home for comedians, visual artists, and performers across the city,” said local comedian Amanda Averell in September. “Hambone's is a home to so many and that's because of Jeff. He believed so much in the comedy scene of the city and all the comedians. He made everyone feel welcome. Even before the pandemic, Hambone's was showing signs of financial struggles. In Dec. 2019, the business was closed shortly due to delinquent Alcoholic Beverage Tax payments, but the debt was quickly paid and it soon reopened. According to longtime friend and former Hambone's employee Mary Jo Coll, Holt also lost his fiance, Jocelyn Marie Hill, in 2019 after she suddenly passed away during a visit to Hambone’s. She was 43. Despite these hardships, Hambone's was still universally loved in the city. This year, it took third place for Best Dive Bar in CP's Best of Pittsburgh readers' poll. Hambone's thanked patrons, performers, staff, and vendors for their support of the bar over the years. “Just from all of us, to all of you, we will miss you and goodbye,” reads a post on Facebook. “We will provide details of any sale of equipment when we know. Thank you to everyone, patrons, performers, staff, vendors ... all of you.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Drink, Food, Music, Hambones, Lawrenceville, Pittsburgh, closed, Jeff Holt, venue, music, comedy Related Content Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

She’s attended countless fish fries over the years and is very generous with her expertise, posting her thoughts on all things fish fry on her social media accounts throughout the season, which continues this year through Fri., April 15. Whittington is a friend of a friend, and I have long heard tell of her overwhelming enthusiasm for and knowledge of regional fish fries. A few years after attending her first fish fry in 2010, Whittington started posting reviews of each fish fry she attends. These days, she posts them the same day on her Instagram stories, which you can find at @jessowski. Jess grew up in Wexford and currently lives in Edgewood with her husband Alan and their Boston Terrier, Boggins. Pittsburgh City Paper talked to Whittington over email about her great love, church-served fried fish and homemade mac & cheese. When did you attend your first fish fry? What do you remember of it? I actually have an answer for you. I was lucky enough to be asked by Patrick Jordan [founder and artistic director of barebones productions] to be a guest on his video podcast “Alone Together Pittsburgh” last year to talk fish fries (along with Dan Gigler and Kate Romaine), and was asked this same question but couldn’t come up with an answer. After some Facebook sleuthing, I discovered that on March 12, 2010, I posted, “has never been to a fish fry…tonight’s the night! I don’t get it, but it sounds awesome.” And I’ve never looked back! I did not grow up going to fish fries, I don’t even know if I knew that they existed. I LOVE fried fish and I LOVE mac & cheese, so I guess I was just like, f it, let’s check these things out. How many have you been to? So many. I really try my hardest to make it to a fry every single Ash Wednesday and Friday of Lent. In more recent years, I’ve tried to check out a new one I’ve never been to before each week. Doesn’t always work out, but it’s taken me to some towns I’d never ordinarily find myself in. When did you realize your engagement with fish fries was more rigorous than average? When people started coming out of the woodwork to message me asking for advice on which fish fries to hit up. More and more people reach out each year, which I am obsessed with. I always laugh every time I get a message and am just like, “Is this my legacy?” Usually it’s friends, but occasionally someone I haven’t talked to in years will reach out, and I’m always shocked that they’re paying attention to my posts. In the days leading up to Lent, I get tons of messages, like, “I can’t wait for your posts, I look forward to this every year” and I’m, like, “REALLY?!” I love it. I always post a pic of the meal on Facebook and Instagram and give a rating. My rating system has not been consistent over the years. … It’s all just for fun. This is my season! What do you look for in a fish fry? If they serve mac & cheese! It’s almost a non-negotiable for me. You often find cafeteria-style mac-in-a-bag type situations at fish fries, which I know is much cheaper and easier, but nothing beats homemade mac & cheese. Mac & cheese is, no joke, my favorite food, and I think pairing it with fried fish makes it an incredible meal. The best, though, is if a fish fry serves the holy trinity: mac & cheese, halushki, AND pierogi! I mean, seriously, just give me all the carbs. I also look for something I like to call “cronche.” I prefer a battered fish to a breaded fish — it has a much better cronche, aka crispy batter that doesn’t get soggy. How would you recommend someone new to the area, or new to fish fries, go about introducing themselves to the scene? Just go! I remember when I first started thinking about going to fish fries, I thought I had to be a member of the church or something. I literally had no idea how it all worked. It was a little weird and intimidating walking into these places at first, but then you see just how popular and important these are to communities, and you realize everyone’s here for the same reason — to get themselves a beige plate of deliciousness! If you’re having a hard time deciding where to go, a great resource is the Pittsburgh Lenten Fish Fry Map at codeforpittsburgh.github.io/fishfrymap. I use it to plot out my fry destinations and they’re constantly updating it. I have no idea who runs it. Who are you?! Thank you for your service!

As the years have progressed, many local restaurants have added vegan or vegetarian-friendly sandwiches and sides to these meals, allowing non-meat eaters to join in on the observance. Here are five places in Pittsburgh where you can get a vegan-friendly and Lent-friendly meal. Wild Rise Bakery 717 N. Homewood Ave., Homewood. wildrisebakery.com Wild Rise, in addition to a traditional fish sandwich, has a Fried Oyster Mushroom Sando that you can indulge in if you are vegan. As always with Wild Rise, the meal is also gluten-free. The oyster mushroom is marinated in Caribbean seasoning before it’s fried, so prepare for a mouth-watering experience. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Wild Rise Bakery (@wildrisebakery) Viridis 1506 E Carson St., South Side. viridispgh.com Viridis is all vegan all the time, so they added a Banana Blossom Fish Sammie to their menu just in time for Lent. The Banana Blossom itself is a purple-skinned flower that grows at the end of the bunch of bananas that, when cooked, has a soft, flaky texture that resembles fish. Featuring a toasted bun, house-made tartar sauce, lettuce, and a fried banana blossom filet, you’re sure to have a unique dining experience with this one. Onion Maiden 639 E. Warrington Ave., Allentown. onionmaiden.com This vegan restaurant also carries a Banana Blossom Po Boy that will have you running back for more. With the right marinades and seasonings, it does a good job of mimicking the fish you might have grown up with. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Onion Maiden (@onionmaidenpgh) Ruggers Pub 40 S. 22nd St., South Side. ruggerspub.com Ruggers has a surprisingly good vegan menu in addition to its regular bar food, and they recently added a Fried Tofu Po Boy with vegan remoulade sauce, served on a hoagie bun with lettuce, tomato, and diced pickles. Farmer x Baker 1101 Powers Run Road, Fox Chapel. farmerxbaker.com Does the name Filet O' Flower entice you? This Farmer x Baker offering is massive, made with cauliflower and topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and house sauce. You might have to unhinge your jaw to tackle it but it will be worth it.

Skip the Fish Fry and try these Fish Fridays By Ryan Deto click to enlarge Fish Fry Fridays are an institution in the greater Pittsburgh region. Scores of churches, restaurants, breweries, and more serve fried fish in late winter to hungry customers who are observing Catholics (and everyone else!). What might have started as a way to help Catholics observe Lent, Fish Fries have transformed into community gatherings, and something for Pittsburghers to look forward to during the winter doldrums. But the tradition has still largely left out some, like people seeking gluten-free options. Fried fish sandwiches are the name of the game for most Fish Fridays, but battered, breadcrumb-laden fish on a roll are covered in gluten. For those with Celiac disease, gluten-intolerance, or people who just want to reduce their gluten intake, Pittsburgh City Paper found six great spots that offer all that great seafood taste for Fish Friday, but without the gluten. Casa Brasil 5904 Bryant St., Highland Park. casa-brasil.com This hip Brazilian spot is offering some fried goodness with gluten-free fish and chips each Friday during lent to celebrate Fish Friday. The fish is fried smelts made with gluten-free batter, and the chips are fried yuca, a root vegetable popular in South America. It’s bit different than the typical fried cod and french fries, but a relief for gluten-free diners looking for a similar experience. Served Fridays only during Lent. Kahuna Poke and Juice bar 132 S. Highland St., East Liberty. kahunapgh.com Pick from a variety of poke bowls loaded with tuna or salmon at this eatery in East Liberty. Gluten-free sauces are available on request, so just ask the staff, and they will ensure you that a bowl filled with fish rice, vegetables, and other mix-ins will have no traces of gluten. Poke bowls range from spicy to sweet and are loaded with flavor. Penn Ave Fish Company 2208 Penn Ave., Strip District. pennavefishcompany.com Some of the freshest fish in Pittsburgh, and they accommodate gluten-free diners extremely well. Sample their extensive sushi menu and remind staff about accommodating your gluten-free requests. And because Penn Ave Fish Company has so many options to choose from, sushi doesn’t have to include raw fish. Try the eel or shrimp for some cooked sashimi or nigiri. Saint Irenaeus Catholic Church 387 Maryland Ave., Oakmont. holyfamilypgh.org A traditional Pittsburgh Fish Fry, at a church, that offers gluten-free fish and bread. Just what the doctor ordered. At Saint Irenaeus in Oakmont, patrons can order a baked fish sandwich on a gluten-free bun, and some gluten-free sides like coleslaw or a salad. Open for lunch and for dinner. Take-out only. Shaka inside Federal Galley 200 Children’s Way, North Side. federalgalley.org This joint located inside Federal Galley is taking the North Side by storm, and it’s a great place for a gluten-free poke bowl while your gluten-loving friends are waiting in line for the fish fry at the nearby Elks lodge. Try the Spicy Smoked Salmon bowl with edamame, chickpea, onions, pickled vegetables, roe, and toasted sesame. Make sure to ask for gluten-free soy sauce. Shaka's poke is next level. Umami 202 38th St., Lawrenceville. umamipgh.com This popular restaurant offers fresh fish and seafood grilled over hot charcoals in a process known as robatayaki. Order from the Robata menu, where cooks will grill you up a whole fish or squid, or individual shrimps. Make sure to remind staff about your gluten-free desires, and they will accommodate you. The whole fish takes 25 minutes to cook, so order ahead.

I was very excited to see him bring Cantonese food to the city, which is far more scarce than Sichuan or Taiwanese style, and see how he would mix up the traditional fare. The din and interior design of Parlor felt like an Asian speakeasy out of the 1920s, full of neon signs and darkened glass, the furniture echoing the noise of the restaurant. My party and I sat down at our table, which was outfitted with a small lazy Susan, as our waiter pointed out what the restaurant really asks of their customers — to share. This kind of place is best visited with a group of five or more so that you can try a little bit of a lot of different dishes. Even some of their cocktails were made to be shareable. What most excited me on the cocktail list was a drink using 白酒 baijiu, a colorless Chinese liquor that can be quite tricky to find. Many of the cocktails listed used a variety of Asian liquors with different fruits and spices. I tried the Butler Street Dynasty Highball, which was full of sweet, sour, and tangy flavors. While this drink was a bit strange for my liking, I would like to come back, especially to try some of their Sichuan pepper-infused drinks. The food menu consisted of all the traditional 点心 dim sums, but I really wanted to try some of the larger entrees. Many of the entrees were slightly altered takes on traditional dishes. The Salt and Pepper Trio served shrimp, squid, and scallops in a style usually reserved only for shrimp. The scallops were so tender and juicy and matched well with the seasoning. It was by far my favorite dish, with a good level of spicy pepper. Our waiter informed us that this was the dish the staff often ate. Another high point of the meal was the Cantonese BBQ. We tried a sampler of all their offerings, of which I favored the 叉燒 char siu pork. The pork was tender and packed with rich umami flavor. The dim sum menu seemed quite traditional in comparison to the entrees, and it produced mixed reactions among the members of my dinner party. The 肠粉 cheung fun, or fun roll proved a bit disappointing, but the veggie dumplings were beyond excellent. The skins of the dumplings were of perfect thickness and texture, the corn-filling surprisingly flavorful. However, we simply didn’t order that much dim sum since it felt weird to order it for dinner. My biggest complaint is that the restaurant isn’t open for dim sum hours, usually around brunch. The first time I tried to eat at Parlor, I arrived in Lawrenceville on a Sunday morning only to find the restaurant closed and only open in the evenings. I stood outside on Butler Street wondering what to do. I look forward to returning and trying more dishes from Parlor's extensive menu. I hope that either the restaurant will open for Sunday brunch hours in the future or I'll overcome my bias that 粥 congee and dim sum are only morning foods. There’s nothing I wouldn’t give to have more Chinese brunch options in the city.

Anytime they make the five-plus hour drive to Pittsburgh from Virginia for a weekend visit, my husband plans every meal with them, down to the last brunch before they head back. We make reservations at the city’s fanciest or newest spots, places we always wanted to try but had trouble justifying dropping a huge chunk of change on one feast. Luckily, my husband’s parents are delighted to foot the bill, meaning there are no limits on what we can order. Recently, we embarked with them on a veritable food tour at various local restaurants. The stops, ranging from popular to newer establishments, provided opportunities galore to try places and cuisine I’d otherwise forego for cost reasons. Senti 3473 Butler St., Lawrenceville. sentirestaurant.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Inside Senti It's a busy, but not hectic Friday night at this modern Lawrenceville Italian restaurant and wine bar. For years, I’ve driven past this place without stopping in. My motto for eating out has always been to avoid anything I could easily make at home — this especially applies to Italian cuisine, as I, perhaps stupidly, assume that anyone can whip up a decent red sauce (I always make my own) and pasta. Senti showed me how very wrong I was in this belief. Every dish, from apps to entrees, was a hit. I started with the Bruschetta con Funghi, toasts topped with cold, well-seasoned mushrooms and microgreens. Then came the Insalata di Barbabietola, a burrata dish that edged on refreshing (an odd way to characterize cheese but accurate in this case) with its voluptuous, milky bulb, delicately marinated beets, and sprinkling of pistachios. Rarely have I finished starters that left my appetite whetted without taking up valuable entree space. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Insalata di Barbabietola at Senti So focused was I on eating that I completely forgot to write down the name of the filled pasta special that came as my main dish — I wanna say it was cappelletti? Either way, it proved a savory, indulgent, truffle-infused dream. I would gladly order it again were it a regular menu item. As for the rest of my party, my husband seemed especially fond of the Carciofi Fritti, a fried artichoke dish that looked inviting even to me, who finds the thistly delicacy overrated. When the restaurant opened in 2015, a Pittsburgh City Paper review from the time “found the food worthy of its posh surroundings,” a sentiment with which I agree. The decor, with its spotless white walls and table cloths, plush chairs, and vaguely Mid-Century Modern touches, may seem dated (I called it “rich divorced dad contemporary”), but I welcome anything that deviates from the cold, industrial echo chamber every restaurateur is so fond of now. At least here, I’m not shifting uncomfortably on a metal stool and hearing conversations from three tables away. Balvanera 1660 Smallman St., Strip District. balvanerarestaurants.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Eggs Benedict at Balvanera Saturdays are for the Strip District, and this visit included brunch at Balvanera. The Argentinian-inspired restaurant near the Heinz History Center opened in 2023, succeeding a New York City location. This is not the frittata and fresh fruit kind of brunch to which I’m accustomed. The Arancini de Coliflor, a plate of cauliflower and rice croquettes with quince purée, made for a bright, crispy starter, followed by the Empanadas de Humita, hot, delicious, pleasantly sweet pockets of sweet corn, roasted red pepper, provolone, and aji amarillo. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Arancini de Coliflor and Empanadas de Humita at Balvanera Since COVID, I have relaxed a bit on my devotion to vegetarianism, meaning I try a little meat here and there if the mood strikes. In this case, I sampled one of my father-in-law’s Boquerones, fresh, unsalted, delectable white anchovies with pan con tomate. If you’re wondering how Balvanera deals with brunch staples, I was served a solid eggs Benedict with perfectly poached eggs, cooked spinach, and creamy hollandaise, meaning that less adventurous diners will find something here to enjoy. The Parlor Dim Sum 4401 Butler St., Lawrenceville. theparlordimsum.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz The Parlor Dim Sum We spend Saturday night at The Parlor Dim Sum, a Lawrenceville spot serving Cantonese cuisine aside from its dumpling namesake. Opened in 2019, the venture from Chef Roger Li, the restaurateur behind Umami, Ki Ramen, and Ki Pollo welcomes diners with an ambiance defined by warm, red neon light and speakeasy vibes. The most laid-back portion of my culinary journey featured a menu of everything from accessible spring rolls and noodles to chicken feet. My previous experience sampling spicy, jellied chicken feet made me curious about what Parlor had in store; after two rich meals, however, I decided to give my stomach a break with something more familiar. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu with wheat glutton, doubanjang, and pickled radish. The dish was a welcome comfort on the brutally cold Pittsburgh night — the steamed tofu held up well against the hot broth, and the wheat glutton was a sufficient vegetarian substitute for the minced pork that traditionally comes with ma po. One thing that stands out about Parlor, compared to our previous stops, is the portions. I had plenty of leftovers, and the table was quick to \"ooh\" and \"ahh\" when my father-in-law's whole branzino came out, its dramatically curled body barely contained by the plate. Even with the more expensive dishes, you're getting your money's worth, and then some. Eleven 1150 Smallman St., Strip District. elevenck.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Eleven After a night of digesting our plentiful Cantonese food, we returned to the Strip District for brunch at Eleven. I felt underdressed as I walked into this giant, muti-floor restaurant that screams \"fancy birthday dinner for your grandma.\" The inviting ambiance includes comfy, U-shaped booths, exposed brick, and largesse defined by its sheer size and decorative touches, namely the towering wall of wines looming over the foyer. It's the kind of place you could imagine holding court over a table of your peers, pouring wine, and laughing over stories you've told 100 times, followed by everyone good-naturedly arguing over who gets the check. The bar area below our second-floor table looked stylish and welcoming with its padded cafe table chairs and dark colors. The brunch didn't wow me as much as the previous entries had. The small quiche I ordered as a starter came out lukewarm and left me wanting, and the eggs Benedict (yes, I ordered it again — sue me) were best described as fine. Looking back, I wish I had ordered the omelet. Still, the restaurant left an impression on me, and I plan on visiting again, though it will likely be a night of cocktails and apps in the bar area.

This made the opening of Senti Restaurant and Wine Bar, an unabashedly upscale Italian restaurant in the traditional fine-dining vein, a bit of a jolt to our expectations. The tradition lies not so much in the food, but in the plush furnishings, white linen and black-tie service. What the attentive, professional and gracious servers bring is Italian — not Italian-American — food done up in modern style, which is to say with artfully composed plates, modest (but sufficient) portions and awareness of trendy foods like pork belly. The overall effect is what we might imagine a tastefully contemporary restaurant in an Italian city to be like. Some of Senti's polish derives from its location in a new apartment building at Doughboy Square. Its storefront spans quite a bit of sidewalk glass, extending into a recessed courtyard. Senti eschews the current trend for rustic neutrals in favor of a crisp color scheme that contrasts stark white with plush purple, accented by bold, abstract paintings on the walls. A long booth — more like a couch — upholstered in white leather breaks up one of the dining rooms, and the corners make for cozy, if not private, dining. For the most part, we found the food worthy of its posh surroundings. The menu is almost as minimalist as the decor (not a fault in our book — we appreciate a kitchen that knows its strengths). But the daily specials fill in the gaps, and sounded so good we were tempted to order them almost exclusively. One that we couldn't resist was a housemade mozzarella ball, stuffed with a white anchovy and served atop a slice of local tomato amid arugula pesto and wisteria flowers. The cheese didn't have the tender texture of buffalo mozzarella but rather something a bit closer to firm, creamy chevre. The anchovy's assertively briny, but not fishy, flavor made this a glorious morsel. Photo by Vanessa Song Scallop crudo with watermelon radish, fennel and piquillo pepper at Senti Cuttlefish with polenta consisted of pliant slices of cephalopod, their texture similar to that of Portobello mushroom, served alongside a compact wedge of corncake that was neither fluffy nor granular, but more like a firm custard. The textures were the most notable feature of this appetizer, which had flavors so mild that it was almost bland. Radicchio salad with cream of beans sounded like a balanced flavor combination; we expected the earthy, slightly sweet beans to temper the bitterness of the radicchio. Unfortunately, it wasn't so. The pureed white beans were too scant, and even when we scooped a lot onto a single piece of radicchio, its bitterness was overpowering. Most of this plate returned to the kitchen. A special of grill-smoked filet mignon on a bed of springtime risotto was a great success, however. The meat was cooked perfectly, with the grill imparting just enough flavor to the mild steak without smothering it in char. The risotto had been cooked in a rich broth and included finely diced, chewy, savory bits of prosciutto, ramps and white asparagus, each component distinct but delectably complementary. Duck breast was served over more custard-like polenta and slathered with pevarada, an oily sauce studded with finely minced liver that enlivened the polenta but was superfluous with the beautiful, rich, rosy fowl. Lasagna alla Veneta, a.k.a. Bolognese, was intensely creamy with bechamel enveloping rich ground meat between stacks of tender noodles. Amid all Senti's modern adaptations, this was an example of an Old World classic that should instantly win over any American, despite how it differs from the familiar red-sauce version of this dish. Spaghetti in Salsa here means an olive oil-based sauce featuring sautéed, sliced onion and chopped anchovies. This was so dramatically different from any pasta sauce we have ever had that, despite its simplicity, it took a few bites to acclimate to its taste. But once we did, we fell for its unique combination of pungent, fruity and umami notes, so much more delicately composed than that of traditional tomato-and-meat sauce. Chocolate bread pudding for dessert was every rich, moist, cocoa-licious thing we had hoped for, even if the rosemary-infused ice cream was crystalline. By keeping portion sizes eminently reasonable, Senti is able to offer its excellent Italian fare at prices far more affordable than those at comparably fancy restaurants. Indeed, by far the dearest items on the menu are the wines, which range from expensive to stratospheric. We'd rather swoon at the food than the beverage bill, but at Senti, you can do both.

Not Your Average Noodle by Jon “D-Boi” Brown, R. Ya’iyr Carter, and Pierre “Polo” Pinson is described as “an act of service compiled by prisoners for the benefit of prisoners.\" For those who “don’t know what it’s like to attempt culinary arts behind bars,” the authors encourage altering and experimenting with the recipes, “which is what we are constantly doing.” Readers can order the full-color, 67-page, saddle-stitched cookbook through Dinner Bell’s website, with options to send a copy to a prisoner. For every copy purchased, one will also be donated through a Books to Prisoners program, with the remaining proceeds going to the authors.

During Crapteka, Apteka’s normal menu will be on pause, with diners advised to expect veggie burgers and fries, sunflower seed milkshakes, “cocktails with pineapple n fun stuff that aren’t just little berries,” and other less-than-gourmet treats. Food will still be all-vegan and made from scratch, served during normal hours. Crapteka runs weekends from Fri., Jan. 19-Feb. 4, with pre-orders for take-out (recommended) open on Wednesdays at noon. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Apteka in Bloomfield Pittsburgh Beerfest 1000 Fort Duquesne Blvd., Downtown. pittsburghbeerfest.com Just in time to warm us up, Pittsburgh Beerfest returns on Fri.

Buffalo Sauce Boycott With a playoff upset in their sights, Steelers fans turned to protest, with local restaurants boycotting Buffalo sauce ahead of yesterday’s wildcard game against the Buffalo Bills. TribLive reported that restaurants across the region, including 22 McDonald’s locations and Bubba’s Gourmet Burghers & Beer in Cecil Township (owned by 100.7 FM’s Bubba Show host Bubba Snider), “yank[ed] the sauce” ahead of the game, even extending the ban as the matchup was postponed due to blizzard conditions. The sauce boycott story has since gone national, picked up by Buffalo, N.Y. outlets and Sports Illustrated. Hello Bistro hellobistro.com Amid cutbacks by Eat’n Park Hospitality Group, Hello Bistro’s South Side location closed on Jan. 15. “We are grateful to our team members and guests who joined us over the last decade on East Carson Street,” the combination salad-and-burger restaurant wrote in an email to the Pittsburgh Business Times. The announcement comes on the heels of several other South Side eateries closing, including The Vault Taproom (in the former Beehive space), Stagioni, Doughbar, and Jimmy John’s.

Hazelwood Brew House 5007 Lytle St., Hazelwood. instagram.com/hazelwoodbrewhouse After seven years of planning and renovation, the much-anticipated Hazelwood Brew House opened, debuting two of three breweries that will occupy the space. New France Brewing Company — touted on its Instagram as “artisanal over industrial” and named after the French construction of Fort Duquesne — opened on June 12, while Abstract Realm Brewing Company, which specializes in handcrafted ales and lagers, opened the following day. Bonafide Beer Co., another craft brewer that runs a taproom in the Strip District, is the third brewery set to open at the location. Each business will operate its own brewing facility under the same roof while offering three distinct bars for visitors. The new Hazelwood Brew House on Lytle St. occupies a 20,000-square-foot, four-story building listed on the National Register of Historic Places and operated during Prohibition. According to Patch, the building sat vacant for decades until it was purchased in 2017 by The Progress Fund, a Greensburg-based community development nonprofit.

Thankfully, for those feeling the inspo to be more environmentally-friendly consumers, there’s a growing wave of eco-conscious restaurants in Pittsburgh spearheading the charge towards a greener, tastier future. From fledgling establishments championing farm-to-table freshness to inventive kitchens pioneering zero-waste techniques, the city is merely scratching the surface of its sustainable gastronomic potential. So, if you’re hungry, but want to leave as little trace as possible, here is a guide to the city's blossoming eco-friendly restaurant scene. (Spoiler alert: You'll find a brunch-heavy lineup ahead, but trust us, these are worth getting out of bed for.) The Speckled Egg SSW 428 S 27th St., DowntownWith a commitment to eco-conscious practices, Speckled Egg Café serves up a menu as kind to the planet as it is to your taste buds. From the moment you order, you'll notice the biodegradable cups, recycled cardboard, paper straws, and thoughtful paper packaging — all chosen to minimize waste. Of course, the real draw is the food. Picture this: eggs sourced from a local farm in Indiana, Pennsylvania, artisanal bread fresh from Mediterra, and vibrant juices from Pittsburgh Juice Co. — all of which bring plenty of local goodness. For a tropical-inspired treat to kickstart your morning, try the Aloha Puddin', a coconut chia pudding topped with fresh fruit, granola, and a drizzle of agave. And don't miss out on their Quiche for a Cause — not only is it delicious, but a portion of the profits goes to support local charities. As you dine amidst the lush greenery, take note of the plants adorning the dining room, contributing to a fresh atmosphere while echoing Speckled Egg's commitment to sustainability. Plus, with their building boasting a Silver LEED accreditation, you can brunch knowing that your experience aligns with responsible practices. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Square Cafe Square Cafe 134 S Highland Ave., East Liberty At Square Cafe, brunch comes with a conscience. Since its founding in 2003, Square Cafe has been committed to reducing waste, supporting local suppliers, and pioneering eco-conscious practices. Owner Sherree Goldstein proudly shares, \"We're always looking for ways to become more environmentally sound.\" Square Cafe's recent participation in groundbreaking research on kitchen air quality with PSE Healthy Energy further underscores its commitment to sustainability. It is the first restaurant in the U.S. to undergo such testing. With approximately $3 million donated to charity, over 100,000 volunteer hours logged, and more than 200,000 pounds of waste from landfills diverted, sustainability is more than a checkbox here. It is a lifestyle. The brunch game is no afterthought either — offerings include fluffy stacks of Shamrock pancakes, indulgent Corned Beef Benedict, a creamy White Rabbit Latte, refreshing Pink Lemonade Mimosas, and so much more. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of EYV EYV Restaurant 424 E Ohio St., Deutchtown In the historic Deutschtown neighborhood, EYV stands out as a vegetable-forward gem, celebrating the bounty of Western Pa. and East Ohio farms. Named among The Pittsburgh Post Gazette's & Pittsburgh Magazine’s Best New Restaurants of 2023, EYV crafts dishes where veggies steal the show, with meats and seafood playing a supporting role. Imagine indulging in dishes like Beer Battered \"Codiflower\" or digging into a plate of Cabbage Pastrami. Yep, you heard that right — pastrami made of cabbage. Beyond the veggie focus, their all-electric, gas-free kitchen and use of earth-friendly alternatives like washcloths instead of paper towels reflect a dedication to reducing environmental impact. They go the extra mile by sourcing fresh, seasonal ingredients locally whenever possible. They've teamed up with awesome local farms like Coldco Farms and Tiny Seed Farms, ensuring that every bite supports the community and reduces carbon footprints. They're not wasteful either —- EYV gets creative with food scraps, drying all their vegetable trim into veg kombu for flavorful stocks. Oh, and did we mention they're big on recycling too? click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of EYV Stick City Brewing 109 Irvine St., Mars “Protect the Sticks!” is a statement that Stick City Brewing swears by. They’re all about protecting our wild, beautiful world. Inspired by the Pa. state tree, the Eastern Hemlock, their logo pays homage to the natural areas where many find solace away from the hustle and bustle. They're all about showcasing terroir in beer — that unique essence of grains, hops, water, and yeast. Just in time for patio sipping, try a pint of their Sunnyside, an American IPA bursting with flavor, or for something lighter, go for the Moon & Mars, an American Pale. When it comes to sustainability, Stick City is committed to making a difference, both locally and globally. They're the first craft brewery in Pennsylvania to join the 1% for the Planet movement, donating a portion of their sales (gross sales, not profits!) to environmental nonprofits because they genuinely care about our wild areas and waterways. Cheers to that — and to protecting the sticks, one pint at a time. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Commonplace Coffee Commonplace Coffee Commonplace Coffee Various locations First things first — Commonplace is your go-to spot for top-notch java. Whether you need a morning wake-up call or an afternoon pick-me-up, they've got super freshbeans and smooth roasts to satisfy your caffeine cravings. The eco-friendly coffee shop uses a special hybrid coffee roaster that not only makes amazing coffee but also reduces harmful emissions. Ever wondered what happens to all those leftover coffee grounds and bits? Their collaboration with Zero Waste Wrangler resulted in composting over 33,000 pounds of coffee grounds and chaff in 2023 alone, a testament to their dedication to waste reduction. Commonplace goes the extra mile with its eco-friendly packaging. From their use of compostable hot cups and lids to their retail coffee bags composed of 60% renewable plant-based materials, they're committed to minimizing environmental impact. And here's the cherry on top: they use oat milk as their sole non-dairy milk option at no additional cost. Café Phipps Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens: Café Phipps, 1 Schenley Dr., Oakland Café Phipps is a 3-star Green Restaurant Certified® eating establishment and they're kind of a big deal. They've been featured by Food & Wine as one of the best museum restaurants in the U.S. The food is a celebration of organic, local, and sustainable goodness. Talk about farm-to-table freshness: think produce from Phipps’ own Edible Rooftop Garden and onsite hydroponic system. Since 2011, they've said goodbye to factory-farmed meats, opting instead for ethically-sourced options. Plus, they've banished disposable service ware, opting for real service ware and China since 2006. They've gone all in with 100% compostable cups and paper products, recycling or composting a whopping 96% of their waste. Even their cleaning products are biodegradable and GreenSeal™ certified. The menu offers plenty of global flavors with locally grown produce — mouthwatering options like the Chicken Bánh Mì, Roasted Beet and Jicama Panini, and Hawaiian Pulled Pork. And for the little ones, there's a kids' menu featuring wholesome choices like the Almond Butter and Berry Sandwich. click to enlarge CP Photo: Lisa Cunningham The Falafel dinner platter at 40 North 40 North at Alphabet City 40 W North Ave., North Side Led by two-time James Beard-nominated chef Beth Zozula, the menu at 40 North changes daily, depending on what's in season and what's available from nearby farms. It's not just about the food — it's about building a thriving local economy and celebrating the goodness of homegrown ingredients. They get two lambs a week from Salem's, a local halal lamb supplier. They butcher the lamb in-house and use every single part of the animal, from nose to tail. A house specialty is the Kelepaca, a Turkish soup made from the head and ankles, brimming with collagen, fortified with yogurt, and egg, and served with homemade focaccia. And speaking of zero waste, they take it seriously. Every scrap of food that can't be used in the kitchen goes to a friend's dog. They're also big on upcycling: think plates from thrift stores and repurposed items from the fine arts department. In the summertime, they're all about pickling, preserving, fermenting, smoking, and drying — all to capture the flavors of the season and use them throughout the year. Photo by Erin Kelly Oysters are the centerpiece of the menu. Muddy Waters Oyster Bar 130 S Highland Ave., East Liberty If you're tired of the same old brunch routine, hop on over to Muddy Waters for a soulful, Cajun-inspired brunch. Here, they farm their own oysters locally, not just for their taste but for their environmental impact. These mollusks are not only a delicacy but also eco-warriors, filtering water, sequestering carbon, and fostering marine ecosystems. Just one oyster can filter over 50 gallons of water a day. As part of the Shellfish Recovery Partnership, they recycle all their shells to create estuaries, nurturing future generations of shellfish and promoting a healthy aquatic environment. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of 1:11 Juice Bar 1:11 Juice Bar 2743 E Carson St., South Side At this Black and Korean family-owned gem, they're crafting delicious drinks, with sustainability shining through in every aspect of their operation.

Here, you get to grill mouthwatering meats on smokeless grills right at your table. It's not only interactive and fun but oh-so-delicious. The best part? All that sizzle comes with a side of sustainability. Thanks to Executive Chef Sorcha Murnane's dedication, Cobra Kitchen proudly sources local ingredients, minimizing its carbon footprint. From mushrooms to produce, they prioritize partnerships with nearby suppliers like Bounty Beneath and COLDCO Farm. Their commitment to zero waste extends beyond the kitchen, with every protein butchered in-house, ensuring as little as possible goes to waste. Miranda Piso, co-owner at Cobra, says, “When manicuring beef for Yakiniku, all fat trim is pulled off for utilization as grill “seasoning”. Each dinner guest receives a cube of wagyu or prime beef fat to oil up the grills, preventing their Yakiniku from sticking. All Wagyu and Prime ends of primal cuts go into their Cobra Burger.” Even their caviar game is on point, sourced from Tsar Nicoulai Caviar, an Eco-certified sustainable American caviar producer.

If, like me, you grew up on Americanized Chinese food, the first menu — which bills sesame chicken and egg rolls — will feel familiar. The latter will likely not. Chengdu Gourmet has been intoxicating Pittsburghers with the intense flavors of authentic, Sichuan cuisine since 2015. Those who know cuisine from the Sichuan province know it’s associated with spice; its namesake peppercorn is not simply hot, but also numbing. The sensation, compared to the zing of carbonation, primes the palate for heat to come while several aromas evolve as the spice moves from binding to an intense flavor. I ordered a feast of dishes from the restaurant’s traditional menu, starting with Sichuan dumplings and cold sesame noodles, followed by a smattering of vegetable dishes and two meat courses: double-cooked pork and beef in a hot, spicy broth. Spice was strong in almost every dish, which made the sweeter items even more pronounced. Eggplant in a thick garlic sauce was cloying compared to the hot, red peppers sprinkled in an otherwise mild cabbage dish. A friend compared the dumplings to sweet breakfast sausage when put up against the striking flavor of fermented beans and spice in Mapo tofu, a popular dish in Sichuan, consisting of tofu chunks in spicy, oily sauce. Plates of crispy, charred green beans, fresh stir-fried snow pea shoots, and a bacon-like, double-cooked pork were welcome, mild palate changes. The pork dish, a unanimously loved choice, was gloriously — yet not overwhelmingly — fatty and rich. It was worth noting that the spice, particularly in the beef (made Chongqing style, similar to the broth of a hot pot, featuring lotus flower and tofu) wasn’t unpleasant. The aroma of the bright red broth opened up to a complex mix of garlic and other spices. The beef was one of the spiciest dishes — all of the heat was held in the broth — so good that I pushed through the spice to keep eating, eventually getting used to the burn. If you’re new to Sichuan cuisine and are more familiar with an American style menu, I suggest doing research before ordering at Chengdu Gourmet; the menu is vast and a bit overwhelming. (I’m lucky to know a friend who has lived in China, so I often order based on a combination of her recommendations and Google research.) And, make sure to grab a few friends to eat with you. The best way to enjoy a meal from the Squirrel Hill restaurant is by trying as many dishes as possible.

It’s Mecca, it’s Christmas, it’s that first warm spring day after a long winter. At least, it is for the few hundred or so of us Rochester, New York transplants living in the city. “Garbage plates” are invading Pittsburgh. (More on why that’s in quotes in a moment.) All anyone else can do is listen to us being annoying about it. We’re just too happy. Mad Mex Oakland was a Pittsburgh institution. Our own Editor-in-Chief Ali Trachta wrote its eulogy when it closed. But “garbage plates?\" They’re a Rochester institution, and Zechariah Vanzo, general manager of Mero Restaurant Group – which owns Stack’d, CHiKN, and Melt’d, among others – is bringing them to Mad Mex’s former location as the new restaurant, Pilez. Now, if you’re not happy about another dubiously spelled restaurant taking over one of Oakland’s formerly great flagships, that’s fine. We’re not here to convince you that’s good or bad. What we are here to convince you of is the undeniable culinary greatness that is a “garbage plate.” But first, I should probably back up and explain what the fuck I’m talking about. “Garbage plates” are a specifically Rochester invention, so much so that the restaurant that created them, Nick Tahou’s, has the term trademarked (hence the name Pilez in the upcoming Pittsburgh establishment). Nick Tahou’s is a dive to end all dives, founded in 1918 by a Greek immigrant named Alexander Tahou. As a response to lean economic years and a working-class customer base hungering for something hearty, Tahou’s started to serve “hots and potatoes”: potatoes and hot dogs made by Zweiegle’s, an iconic local brand. Of course, this hearty meal that was born out of necessity and the need to feed cash-strapped folks during war time was co-opted by the other great churn of American prosperity: really, really drunk people. A mashup of hearty, caloric food found its natural fanbase in Upstate New York, a land known as much for its ability to consume beer as it is for its ability to withstand snow. Out of this, the current “garbage plate” recipe was born: Two hotdogs, hamburgers, or cheeseburgers (NO BUN) Home fries (French fries are acceptable, but you will be judged) Macaroni salad Meat sauce (The most important element; a mix of ground beef, hot sauce, brown sugar and a few other elements to create something truly glorious) Chopped onions Mustard Ketchup OPTIONAL: baked beans Combine these elements on a singular plate and mash them together to create a glorious mess of garbage. And if your reaction to this description is “Wow! That sounds disgusting!” Well, sure. Understandable. That said, it’s also wrong. “Garbage plates” are best experienced, not described. They’re best taken in amongst friends, in dives and holes in the wall with cheap lighting and thin paper menus. One of the best spots to get a plate in Rochester has a bouncer. It’s a diner. And it’s the perfect setting to eat cheeseburgers that have a sauce made of ground beef as a topping. I don’t know if Pilez will bring an authentic “garbage plate” to Pittsburgh, one that will make me proud to tell people “This is the food of my homeland.” What I do know is I will have outlandishly strong opinions about it, as Rochesterians are similar to Pittsburghers in their comical overprotectiveness of anything that can be claimed as their own. Letting the “garbage plate” into a new land is a big step for me; it’s like watching your kid go away to college. If all goes well, I’ll be the proud father, watching a whole group of new “garbage plate” devotees eat one of their favorite meals and then regret it shortly thereafter. No pressure, Pilez.

Since its opening in 2016, it’s earned national acclaim, with IPAs and stouts worth seeking out, no matter where beer fans are located. This small brewery in Sharpsburg helped put Pittsburgh craft beer on the map, and they haven’t slowed down since. Now, five years later, Dancing Gnome has expanded, opening a new, massive space just down the street from its original location, with all of the amenities one could want from a taproom in 2021. The space is beautiful, and a distinctly non-traditional spot in comparison to most breweries in the city: all futuristic vibes, big open spaces, and a lot more bathroom and parking space then the original location. Pittsburgh City Paper talked with Founder/Head Brewer Andrew Witchey about the new space, and what this means for Dancing Gnome. You opened Dancing Gnome as a modest taproom back in 2016, which is a lifetime in the craft beer industry. Did you ever dream that Dancing Gnome could attain this level of success five years ago? I think yes and no. Getting the first place open and building that space is what I wanted to do, and seeing that come to fruition and being able to be a small brewery producing the beers that we wanted to produce for Pittsburgh was important. I actually distinctly remember those first few years ... We have the fortune of being a popular brand, we had those releases of people camping out for our beers, and people would always ask, “Are you going to expand?” And honestly, my answer was, “No, I don’t want to go through this. It took me two years to open this space. I want to brew beer. I opened this space to brew beer.” And then it got to the point where we realized we either need to grow, or we need to take a step back, because as we started to grow as a company and wanted to do different things, it was hard! We didn’t have the space to be able to brew all of the styles we wanted to brew, our taproom was small, it was busy all the time, which on some levels is great, but we want to be able to share our beer with everybody. So it became, “Yeah, I’m ready for another challenge,” and here we are. click to enlarge CP Photo: Owen Gabbey Dancing Gnomes new taproom in Sharpsburg In terms of the new building, it’s right down the street from the original. Was the plan to alway stay in Sharpsburg and be part of that community? It was always the hope. I had went through the process at other places throughout the city, and then this place kind of fell into my lap. I knew the gentlemen who owned the place and said, “If you’re ever looking to sell, make sure I’m sure the first to know.” And I was actually negotiating on a different space, and he called and was, like, “I think I’m ready to sell, do you want it?” and I was like, “Yes!” So it really worked out because I was able to stay in Sharpsburg, which was important. I love Sharpsburg, and I love its proximity to other places, and the cool part of it is there’s the community of Sharpsburg, but then there’s also a lot of other people that are building into Sharpsburg because of its proximity to other places. From the brewing side, what will this new space allow for in terms of production? Really volume. It’s much bigger, our production space (at 1025) is much bigger than our entire space including the taproom at 925. The other thing is, it was built and designed from the ground up as a brewery, so the efficiency is there. So we’re still growing modestly, but it allows us to brew more volume of each individual beer, as well as more beer. We have way more tanks here, we have bigger volume tanks here, so we can really focus on quality. We don’t have to worry about “OK, we have to get this beer out because we don’t have enough to service the taproom this weekend.” And from a customer facing side, what are you most excited to show off about the new taproom? I think we ultimately designed this space to carry over a lot of the comfort. I think we curated a vibe in our old taproom that was cozy and comfortable. We’re always going to be product forward, and I think that’s important to me and to our brand, that we’re about the product. And we definitely want anyone that comes to our spot to have a wonderful experience, but for the most part, our demographic is coming for the beer. So our old space was small and cozy and we wanted to translate that over here, but this new space is also much larger and more open, so it doesn’t feel as dense as it did at 925, when on a Saturday it felt shoulder to shoulder. So this was designed to carry over the coziness of 925, as well as offer a space that felt much more open. It also will maximize service. Instead of that one tiny section at the bar that everyone had to order from, we can now have a 10-person bar that’s unencumbered by anything else. So it is built for service, and letting everybody be able to order their beers and enjoy their time with friends and family.Dancing Gnome. 1025 Main St., Sharpsburg. dancinggnomebeer.com Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Drink, Dancing Gnome, Andrew Witchey, Sharpsburg, Pittsburgh beer Related Content What is the best pierogi at Polska Laska?

But for middle-aged moms like me who prefer to stay home rather than bar crawl, it’s the perfect time to crank up some Flogging Molly (seriously, I hope Dave King is okay), Irish up my coffee (with some N/A whiskey from The Open Road), and get into some hardcore baking. Once, in my twenties, I baked a loaf of good old-fashioned Irish soda bread that wasn’t half bad. That recipe was sadly lost to my bad memory and poor future planning. So I found this gem in the June 1, 1967 edition of The Pittsburgh Press. It apparently had been the first time The Netherlands Club, The Daughters of Erin and Knights of Equity, and the Russian Orthodox Church of Belle Vernon participated in Pittsburgh’s International Pittsburgh Folk Festival, where nationality groups could showcase their traditional foods.. Now I can “yikes” at the fact that not a single person of color appears in any of the photos and that only exotic countries like Canada appear to have their own trucks there. The black-and-white photos are pretty white, if you get my drift. But the fact is that the festival began at the Syria Mosque and that as early as the late 1950s, Indian, Mexican, and Muslim groups participated, as well as Scottish, Scandinavian, German, and Eastern European heritage groups. And as the festival has grown over the last seven decades, more South American, European, African, and Asian communities have joined.. click to enlarge Newspapers.com The Pittsburgh Press, Jun. 1, 1967 - a snapshot Another thing you may glean from the photos is that the woman holding the Irish Soda bread is smiling brightly. Why wouldn’t she? She just baked something delicious that took very little effort and looks like a million bucks. Irish soda bread is about as easy as baking gets — no yeast, no rising, and very little kneading. Just mix, shape, and pop it in the oven. The result? A golden, craggy loaf with a crisp crust and a soft, airy bread speckled with caraway seeds and raisins. Your kitchen will smell amazing, and your Irish ancestors (real or honorary) will be proud. Here is the original recipe:. 4 cups flour 1 tsp. salt 2 tsp. baking powder 1 scant teaspoon baking soda ½ cup sugar ⅔ cup shortening 3 cups raisins 2 tsp. caraway seeds 1 ½ cups sour milk 3 eggs Have all ingredients at room temperature. Sift flour with salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar into a bowl. Add shortening and cut or mix until texture is crumbly. Stir in raisins and caraway seeds.. Mix sour milk and eggs. Add to flour mixture and blend to make a soft dough. Knead briefly. Shape and place into a 10-inch round skillet. Bake at 375°F for one hour.. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Ingredients for Irish soda bread First, let’s address the sour milk because my first thought was, ew. But making a sour milk substitute from refrigerator staples was really pretty easy. The best solution I found was a 1:2 ratio of Greek yogurt and whole milk. Greek yogurt has a natural acidity that creates a wonderful flavor in this bread. And it added a bunch of protein! (This mixture is pictured in the mint-green bowl above.) I also substituted softened butter for the shortening, but otherwise, I followed this recipe to the letter. I sifted my dry ingredients first then blended my wet ingredients and added them to my mixing bowl. After adding my raisins (half purple, half golden) and caraway seeds, I popped my dough into the greased bottom of my cast iron skillet and baked it for one hour in a preheated oven.. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Irish soda bread Not only did this turn out perfect, it was also easy to freeze the portion that didn’t get gobbled up.

The flour-dusted surface was cluttered with bowls of minced pork, cabbage, and scallions, and stacks of delicate, handmade wrappers. Dumpling-making wasn’t just reserved for holidays. Geng’s parents mandated it to be a monthly tradition, too. While food was never plentiful, her parents always made sure there was enough for this one special meal, and it quickly became the highlight of her childhood. Now, thousands of miles away from that small home in Ningxia, Geng’s dumplings have found a new audience. At Amazing Dumplings, her restaurant in Squirrel Hill, customers line up for the flavors of her childhood. Geng makes dumplings by hand every morning, alongside her dedicated staff. But now, the laughter comes from strangers who have found comfort in her food, in the taste of something handmade, something familiar. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill The masterclass “Dumpling Day was my happiest time,” Geng tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “It wasn’t just about the food. It was about the process, the togetherness.” For Geng, the kitchen was a place of movement and memory. Her mother, the architect of the filling, worked without recipes. The scent of freshly chopped pork, pickled cabbage, and leeks filled the air as she seasoned the mixture, relying on instinct rather than measurement. Every ingredient had a role to play. The pork needed just the right amount of fat — never less than 30% — to keep the filling juicy. The cabbage had to be salted and squeezed dry, its moisture carefully controlled to keep the wrappers from breaking. The leeks, sharp and green, cut through the richness — a fragrant counterpoint. Her father was in charge of the dough, kneading it into smooth elasticity before rolling it into long ropes, cutting them into even pieces. As a child, Geng’s job was to flatten those pieces into disks, trying her best to mimic her father’s swift, effortless movements. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill “I was so eager to help. But my dumpling skins were never quite right. Too thick, too thin, too uneven. My mother would smile and reshape them when I wasn’t looking, ” Geng says. Filling and folding was the final, most delicate step. Her mother’s fingers moved quickly, scooping the fragrant mixture into each wrapper, sealing the edges with firm, sure pleats. Geng, at 7, struggled. Her dumplings refused to hold their shape. More often than not, she abandoned the task altogether, pressing and stretching the dough into abstract, lopsided creations that never made it to the steamer. Her parents would laugh, rolling the scraps back into a neat ball to begin again. But over time, she learned. Dumpling-making, she realized, was an exercise in restraint. The dough had to be thick enough to hold the filling, but thin enough to be tender once cooked. The folds had to be tight, the seams strong. The act of making dumplings was a ritual of survival, a way to create abundance even in times of scarcity. “We didn’t have much. But when we made dumplings, we had each other,” she says. “We had joy. We were OK.” A childhood of scarcity and strength Geng was born in 1965 in Heilongjiang, in China’s frigid, industrial northeast, but she wouldn’t stay there long. Before her first birthday, her parents moved west to Ningxia, a sparsely populated region on the edge of the Loess Plateau, part of a national campaign to develop China’s interior. “Ningxia in the 1960s wasn’t what it is today. It wasn’t like Beijing or Shanghai at the time. It was poor, underdeveloped. We didn’t have much infrastructure. Every meal was something my parents worked for,” says Geng. The move was part of China’s Third Front Movement, a Cold War-era industrialization effort that redirected labor and resources inland, away from the more vulnerable coastal cities. Families like Geng’s, many from China’s northeast, were sent to rural, resource-scarce provinces to build factories, railways, and agricultural outposts. It was a state-driven attempt at self-reliance, but for those on the ground, it meant starting over in an unfamiliar landscape with little support. Her father took on grueling physical labor, while her mother managed the home, eking out meals from whatever ingredients were available. Cooking was an act of ingenuity. “If you had rice, you made congee one day, rice cakes the next, and fried rice the day after,” Geng recalls. “Nothing was wasted. If we had a chicken, every part of it was used: the bones for broth, the meat for dumplings, the skin crisped up and eaten with vinegar.” Yet Ningxia had a culinary identity distinct from anywhere her family had lived before. With a significant Hui Muslim population, the region’s cuisine blended Islamic and Han Chinese influences. Lamb, not pork, was the dominant protein. Spices like cumin, chili, and Sichuan peppercorn infused dishes with warmth. Hand-pulled noodles and beef noodle soup were everyday fare. Náng bread, similar to a Central Asian naan, was baked in domed clay ovens. In Ningxia, food was about sustenance, but it was also about survival. “You had to make do with what you had. That’s why I love simple foods, not because they’re basic, but because they carry meaning. They remind me of home,” says Geng. A new chapter, a new kitchen But some meals carried a meaning that stretched beyond survival. No food in Geng’s childhood embodied that more than dumplings. During Lunar New Year, China’s most significant holiday, dumplings were the centerpiece of the feast. The festival, which follows the lunar calendar and marks the first new moon of the year, is a time for family reunions, sweeping away the misfortunes of the past, and welcoming prosperity. A steaming plate of dumplings is brought out at midnight to ring in the new year. There was a tradition of hiding a single coin inside one dumpling — a small token of luck for the person who found it. Some believed it would bring wealth in the coming year, while others saw it as a promise of good fortune. “I always wanted to find it,” she says. “Somehow, my father always did.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. Dumplings meant abundance, even when times were hard. A family that could make dumplings had flour, meat, warmth, and people to share them with. The number of dumplings eaten also mattered — some families believed that eating more dumplings on New Year’s Eve would bring greater wealth in the coming year. The Lunar New Year meal was filled with symbolism: fish for surplus, spring rolls for wealth, and long noodles for longevity. But dumplings, especially in northern China, remained the most important. Their preparation brought families together, and their presence on the table meant that, no matter how difficult the past year had been, the new year would begin with something warm and whole. But as much as dumplings were a symbol of family, they also became something else for Geng: a connection to home itself. Years later, when she moved to the United States, it was the dumplings she missed the most. The evolution of a dumpling dream In 1995, Geng’s husband, Feng Gao, left Ningxia to scope out life for their family in the United States. At the time, Geng was still in China, raising their 10-year-old son and working a stable job, with no immediate plans to leave. But over time, as Pittsburgh became the anchor for their extended family, the idea of a new home in a new country began to take shape. After visiting, Geng fell in love with the city’s pace, its quiet charm, its possibilities. Neither she nor Gao spoke English, and their professional experience in China didn’t easily translate in the U.S. But they had a foundation stronger than words: a shared love of food. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fengping Geng, owner of Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill, demonstrates the dumpling making process. Gao, driven by both skill and necessity, was the first to enter the culinary world. Over the years, he traveled back to cooking schools in Xi’an, refining his knowledge, immersing himself in the techniques passed down through generations. In 2007, he opened Sakura in Squirrel Hill, a restaurant that quickly became known for its expansive Chinese and Hibachi offerings — including dumplings that had long defined their family’s table. Gao was the face of the restaurant, moving through the dining room with an easy confidence, chatting with customers, overseeing the kitchen. Behind the scenes, Geng worked quietly, handling the details and logistics that made it all run smoothly. For 15 years, the restaurant thrived. But by 2022, change was inevitable. Geng saw an opportunity not just to run the business but to reshape it into something more focused, something that reflected both her past and the new role she was stepping into. On the Fourth of July that year, she renamed the restaurant Amazing Dumplings, scaling down the menu to specialize in the food that had always been closest to her heart: dumplings and noodles from her childhood. Tradition in one hand, experimentation in the other While working on rebranding the business, Geng discovered that, in Pittsburgh, a dumpling-focused menu might be too niche. Unlike cities like New York or San Francisco, where soup dumplings and handmade dumplings were readily available, Pittsburgh’s food scene was still warming up to the idea. Rather than seeing this as an obstacle, Geng saw an opportunity. She studied the thriving dumpling shops of Beijing, paying close attention to how they adapted flavors to suit international tastes. The lesson was clear: variety was key. Some Beijing dumpling houses offered over a hundred different types, ranging from classic pork and cabbage to unexpected seafood fillings. “That was our ‘aha’ moment. We realized we needed to balance tradition with innovation,” she says. At Amazing Dumplings, her menu reflects that philosophy. The foundation is strong classic dumplings: pork and cabbage, pork and celery, egg and leeks. But then, things get interesting. One of her biggest hits is the Kung Pao Chicken Dumpling, a nod to one of Sichuan’s most beloved dishes. Each dumpling is carefully packed with diced chicken, crunchy peanuts, and a slick of chili oil, ensuring every bite delivers that signature sweet-spicy-nutty explosion. The General Tso’s Chicken Dumpling is another crowd favorite. Unlike the deep-fried version found in American takeout spots, Geng’s take is steamed and hits just right — tangy, slightly sweet, deeply satisfying. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Amazing Dumplings in Squirrel Hill One dish carries a particularly personal touch: “General Gao's Spicy Beef Dumplings, crafted by my husband Gao Feng, may not be as famous as General Tso's chicken worldwide, but his relentless pursuit of perfection, despite lacking formal culinary education, has resulted in these unique and spicy beef dumplings,” Geng says. “He is the iron chef in my eyes.” . For her tiniest diners, the Sunrise Chicken Dumpling is a clear favorite. Dotted with bright orange, purple, and green hues, it’s a dish designed to delight. “I love seeing kids get excited about dumplings,” Geng says. “They eat with their eyes first, and then they fall in love with the taste.” These offerings are a reflection of the way Geng approaches food, with lightheartedness, joy, and a willingness to push boundaries. Dumplings may be the heart of the restaurant, but they are not the only star. The thick, slurpable noodles of northern China are another highlight, offering chewy textures and layered flavors. Her Biáng Biáng Noodles, named for the unmistakable thwack sound they make as they’re stretched and slapped against the counter, are served with chopped peppers, a slick of hot oil, and, for those who can handle it, the mouth-numbing punch of Sichuan spice. A surprise ending Where Gao had once been the composed presence at the helm of Sakura, Geng brings a liveliness, a sprightliness that finds its way into everything she touches. Gao is her biggest cheerleader and content to work behind the scenes in this second season of their business. But when Geng rebranded the restaurant to make it Amazing Dumplings, she wasn’t sure what to expect. She had imagined her restaurant as a haven for Chinese customers, people like her, longing for the flavors of home. But as it turns out, she was “thinking too small.” In the last three years, she’s seen diners of all backgrounds embrace her food — not just out of curiosity, but with real affection. Families have gathered around plates of steaming dumplings, first-timers have carefully maneuvered chopsticks, regulars have debated their favorite fillings, and children have eagerly reached for the brightly colored dumplings. It was then she realized: dumplings, like memory, are universal. “I thought dumplings were only Chinese food,” she says. “But really, they belong to everyone.” Amazing Dumplings is located at 5882 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15217.

We call these new meals our “sad, sad, egg-free breakfasts.” But they’re not sad at all. And though this recipe is not technically egg-free, you can make it egg-free like I did. Right now, as a single mom, cooking with chicken eggs feels like cooking with caviar — unnecessarily expensive and fancy. When I came across this overnight coffee cake, it caught my attention. I love to plan ahead, and this recipe makes enough for a whole week of breakfasts. Cake, however, is a four-letter word in our house. Not a single big or little person in my family cares for cake. At birthday parties, we opt for cookies, ice cream, or pie. And though many swear by one cake recipe or another that is somehow “better” or “more moist” or that will “knock our socks off,” we haven’t found a single cake recipe that we all like. My daughter is especially fussy when it comes to cake; she abhors it. But this recipe is far more breakfast than cake. The flavor is a mixture of warm spice and nuts, and it pairs beautifully with fruit and cream. To proactively diffuse any fuss from my kids, I’ve opted to rename these “breakfast squares.” After presenting them as such, they were promptly gobbled up. The original recipe was penned by the lovely Catherine Vodrey (who I had the pleasure to meet online via The Wedding Cookie Table Community) and published in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on Feb. 16, 1997. This is one of those recipes that’s perfect for this chilly, gray, sleepy time of year — you can make it ahead and pop it in a hot oven for a nice warm breakfast in the morning. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Overnight breakfast squares - directions The original recipe reads as follows: 2 cups (8 ounces) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1½ sticks (¾ cup) unsalted butter, room temperature ¾ cup sugar 2 jumbo eggs 1 cup ricotta cheese Topping: ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar ½ cup chopped nuts 2 tablespoons wheat germ 1 tablespoon nutmeg 1 tablespoon cinnamon Grease and lightly flour and 9 x 13” cake pan. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and set aside. Beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the eggs and ricotta. Then, beat in the flour mixture. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat again until smooth. The batter will be thick. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Combine topping ingredients and sprinkle evenly over cake. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake on upper middle rack for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack before serving. Serves 6-8. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds The finished cake, fresh from the oven, before cutting into squares This recipe is lovely as-is, but I made some changes. Instead of ricotta cheese, I used high-protein plain Greek yogurt. In my defense, there is a note on the original recipe stating that sour cream or plain yogurt may be substituted. Also, I added 1 ½ tsp vanilla because I love the flavor. As stated above I used chia eggs instead of jumbo eggs for this recipe. For each “egg,” I mixed together 1 tbsp ground chia seeds with 3 tbsp warm water. I let the mixture sit for ten minutes until it got nice and goopy before adding it to my cake batter. Chia seeds are easy to grind down in a coffee grinder if you have one. Otherwise, a mortar and pestle will do. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Now, it's a square, not a \"cake.\" I expect this cake may have risen more with regular eggs, but it was still light and fluffy and plenty moist. As for the topping, I used a mixture of almonds and pistachios for my chopped nuts, omitted the wheat germ (since I couldn’t find any to save my life), and substituted some ground rolled oats. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Bananas and cream with a dusting of brown sugar I decided to chop up some bananas and dust them with brown sugar and cream as a topping for this lovely little coffee cake, er, I mean, \"breakfast squares.\" For those who are still using eggs in your cooking and baking, I mean absolutely no offense. I'm still happily buying eggs from a local farm, just less of them. Not everyone can go without, and I stand with you. They could be more expensive, all things considered, like they are in some other areas.

Nothing says “I love you” like a tiny, overpriced sphere of cocoa and cream, am I right? Forget grand gestures or heartfelt words — just toss a box of these little confections at your significant other and consider your romantic duties fulfilled. Seriously though, I’m one of the lucky ones who is always spoiled with thoughtful gifts and beautiful evenings. I’m just peeved because I often can’t come up with an amazing Valentine’s gift for my partner aside from additional affection. If I’m going to play along with this sugar-coated tradition, I insist that my partner indulges in the best truffles that I can make. He’s a big fan of homemade gifts. So I took a trip in the way back machine in search of old-school chocolate truffle recipes that won’t break the bank. Prior to 1989, I couldn’t find a single chocolate truffle recipe that wasn’t swimming in alcohol — not on Newspapers.com nor in any of my throwback cookbooks. My partner and I are not big boozers, indulging only in the occasional glass of wine. Evidentially, our parents and grandparents' generation really liked to get sauced! Maybe that’s why my grandparents had ten kids… click to enlarge Newspapers.com The original article in The Pittsburgh Press, Oct. 8, 1989 So I landed on this simple, alcohol-free recipe from 1989. It's a Pittsburgh food editor's knockoff of a French chocolatier’s truffle: 4 ½ cups milk chocolate, melted 1 cup whipping cream 1 ½ tsp. vanilla Unsweetened cocoa powder Place melted chocolate in a medium-sized bowl. In a 1-quart sauce pan scald cream. Remove from heat and let cool for five minutes. Stir in vanilla. Beat chocolate with an electric mixer. Stop the mixer and pour all the cream at once over the chocolate. Continue beating and clean the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula until well blended. This should take 1-2 minutes. To form truffles into balls, chill the mixture in a bowl until firm. Shape into balls with a spoon or mini ice cream scoop and your hands. If the mixture is too soft to form, wash and dry your hands and dust with cornstarch. Arrange your turtles on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Makes 24 to 36 truffles depending on size. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Dark chocolate from Trader Joe's This recipe sounded, to me, like it made a hell of a lot more than 36 truffles based on the 4.5 cups or 1.5 bags of chocolate, so I used my judgment and halved the recipe. I also used dark chocolate since that’s what my partner prefers. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Melted dark chocolate on a double boiler First, I melted the chocolate over a double boiler while scalding my cream in a small saucepan. Once the chocolate was melted, I turned off the heat under the cream. I waited 5 minutes then added the vanilla. Then, I blended the chocolate and cream together with a wooden spoon (I’ve made truffles before, and the electric mixer felt very unnecessary to me) until the mixture was smooth. I placed the bowl in the refrigerator for four hours before scooping. I scooped the chocolate mixture with a 1 tsp. cookie scoop and formed each scoop into a little ball. Then, I dusted them with Hershey’s unsweetened cocoa powder. My cut-in-half recipe produced 48 truffles. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Finished truffles, before I ate some There are now about 40 truffles for my partner (one is a taste test; eight is an indulgence!). These truffles are so rich, creamy and delicious. The two bags of chocolate cost about $3 each, add the cost of the cream and vanilla, and it’s still an inexpensive way to give a lovely homemade gift. Feel free to decorate your truffles according to your tastes. You can’t simply sprinkle them with cocoa powder like I did or get creative and drizzle them with pink or red melted chocolate or even indent them with letters saying “I love you.” You can print my version of this recipe here: PDF — VAL_day_truffles.pdf Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Food, Trader Joe's, The Pittsburgh Press Related Content Trump’s policies and avian flu are driving egg prices up — and begetting plenty of memes By Colin Williams Mar 5, 2025 Before Stormy Daniels, there was Canned Peaches By David S.

That’s a heavy question. The state of our finances, our safety, and even our food seem rather insecure in the upcoming year. We may be moving onward, but it feels like we’re stepping back into the darker times of history: either 1930s Germany or 1790s France. Needless to say, it’s going to be quite a ride, making the old new again. Despite these worries, I’m stepping into New Year's Eve with hope. And to bring good luck, my family will be starting the year with some pork and sauerkraut. click to enlarge The Pittsburgh Press From Dec. 27, 1934 Everybody’s Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother has the very best recipe for pork and sauerkraut, according to the internet. As I was scouring newspaper archives and tattered cookbooks for the oldest possible pork and sauerkraut recipe to come out of Pittsburgh, I found myself staring at an advertisement from 1934. Pork and sauerkraut, according to the advert, is supposed to bring one “good luck or something.” click to enlarge The Pittsburgh Press From Dec. 27, 1934 When taking a deep dive into old recipes, nothing really has changed with this meal since around the 1930s. Bits and pieces about New Year’s feasts that I found prior to that didn’t mention the dish. Rather, people were feasting on turkey or chicken. I know, in my family, that pork and sauerkraut has been served since at least my grandparents’ day. And every recipe, whether it’s from the 1930s, the 1950s, the 1970s, or beyond has been relatively the same: a tenderloin of pork, a pound of sauerkraut for every 2 pounds of meat, onions, apples, caraway seeds, basic spices, and some oil. Some folks even sprinkle in their own secret ingredients like brown sugar or honey. In modern times, most people make this recipe in a slow cooker — set it and forget it. I remember my aunt preparing hers in a pressure cooker. However, I’ve always cooked mine low and slow in a cast iron Dutch oven. To be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of pork tenderloin. While I enjoy the New Year tradition, I feel the classic P&S would taste better with a fattier cut of meat. One wouldn’t have to add oil to the recipe, and all that cabbage, apple, and onion could soak up some delectable fat if, say, one were to smoke a big ol' pork shoulder instead of slow-cooking a sad little tenderloin. If we’re to assume that pork and sauerkraut hails from an old-timey Pennsylvania Dutch tradition, would the meat not have been cooked outside? So today, unlike most of these articles, I’m taking something old, something tried and true, and making it new, original recipe be damned. Here’s my version: • 1 5-lb. pork shoulder (butt) • 2 lb. sauerkraut • 2 large sweet onions, sliced thin • 3 apples, sliced thin • 2 Tbsp. caraway seeds • Salt and pepper to taste • Pork seasoning (Traeger or whichever brand you like) to coat your meat • ¼ cup brown sugar Prepare your pork shoulder with a dry rub of pork seasoning and brown sugar. Place in a disposable aluminum roasting pan uncovered. Smoke at 275 degrees for 6-7 hours or until the internal temperature surpasses 160 degrees. Pull from heat and allow to cool. Gently pull the meat apart with two forks. Set aside ¼ cup of liquid/fat. Pour ¼ cup of leftover pork fat into your dutch oven on the stovetop. Toss in onions and apple slices. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on medium until they begin to soften. Add pork, sauerkraut, remaining juice, and spices. Cover and cook on low for around 1 hour until the flavors combine nicely. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Pork, fresh off the smoker For this recipe, you’re going to need a very large Dutch oven. If you prefer to use a slow cooker, go for it! Simply sautée the onions and apples in a skillet with the pork fat first, then add about an hour to the cook time to combine the flavors nicely. If you don’t have enough space in either a Dutch oven or slow cooker, you may choose to combine half the smoked meat with half the sauerkraut and save the rest of your lovely smoked pork for pulled pork sandwiches or pork rillettes. Serve this dish with mashed potatoes if you’d like. Happy New Year!

While there are ads for beauty products and local services plus an array of recipes meant to make every home warm and happy with loved ones gathered around the table, this page from The Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph was printed in the midst of World War II. During the war, Americans were called upon to ration meat, sugar, butter, certain canned goods, cooking oils, coffee, and a variety of other food products. Those who cooked meals for their families had to do a bit of creative thinking when it came to meal planning. In the current state of our country, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for families to afford their groceries. Not to mention the avian flu crisis, the loss of farm workers to racist ICE raids, and rampant price gouging. There may come a time soon when we may need to stretch our grocery budgets and our creative thinking. This oatmeal bread is a product of WWII ration planning, making good use of cheap ingredients and avoiding using large quantities of rationed goods. There is no sugar, no oil, and very little butter in this bread. Oats were, and still are, cheap, and they stretch out the recipe so you don’t need to use as much flour. This recipe also does not call for eggs, which fits with today’s “rations.” click to enlarge Newspapers.com The original Oatmeal Bread recipe The original recipe calls for the following: 1 ½ cups of oatmeal plus 2 cups of boiling water ½ cup molasses ½ tbsp salt 1 tbsp butter 1 yeast cake (today, we use a yeast packet) dissolved in ½ cup lukewarm water 5 cups flour Add 2 cups of boiling water to one and a half cups of oatmeal and allow to sit for about one and a half hours. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Stir together well. Let rise till doubled in bulk then stir down. Knead gently on a flowered board for 4 to 5 minutes. Turn into buttered bread pans (3). Let rise again until the dough reaches the top of the bread pans. Then bake in a hot oven set to 400° for around 50 minutes. You may add fruit or nuts after the first rising. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds The finished recipe for oatmeal bread After the oatmeal came together, I followed the directions regarding combining the ingredients, but I did so in my KitchenAid stand mixer. I added the flour last, one cup at a time. I used my paddle attachment for the first three cups, then switched to my bread hook attachment before adding the fourth cup of flour. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds Oatmeal bread rising I only have one bread pan, and it’s on the larger side. So I separated my dough into two equal portions and allowed one half to rise in the bread pan first, then baked it. I did not add the optional fruit or nuts to my dough, but I did garnish the top of the bread with raw oats. My bread was fully baked at forty minutes. I removed it from the pan after resting for ten minutes and let it cool on a rack. I sliced the first loaf while it was still warm, which was a mistake. The bread split in the middle. So I sliced the second loaf after allowing it to cool in the refrigerator overnight. The slices came out thin and perfectly even. click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds My second loaf of oatmeal bread. The original author suggests serving this toast with homemade jam. Why not? It has a slightly sweet taste and is wonderful with butter or as French toast. But it also makes a great substitute for sandwich bread. My son and I enjoyed using this bread for grilled cheese sandwiches, which we gobbled down with some broccoli soup (another budget-friendly recipe).
