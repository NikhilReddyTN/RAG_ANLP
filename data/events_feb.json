    "description": "The United States has increasingly with worked with and depended on privately owned companies to spur innovation and advance foreign policy interests. Starting in the 1990s, with the help of government funding of basic R&D and a hands-off approach to regulation, technology companies commercialized the internet, created the smartphone, and built global social media platforms. The U.S. tech sector dominated its competitors in other countries, supplied the technology needed for defense modernization, and promoted American power. This relationship is now being remade through shifts in domestic politics and geopolitical competition, especially with China. What does this mean for US national security and foreign policy interests?\nAdam Segal is the Ira A. Lipman chair in emerging technologies and national security and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). An expert on security issues, technology development, and Chinese domestic and foreign policy, Segal was the project director for the CFR-sponsored Independent Task Force reports Confronting Reality in Cyberspace, Innovation and National Security, Defending an Open, Global, Secure, and Resilient Internet, and Chinese Military Power. His book The Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver, and Manipulate in the Digital Age (PublicAffairs, 2016) describes the increasingly contentious geopolitics of cyberspace. His work has appeared in the Financial Times, the New York Times, Foreign Policy, the Wall Street Journal, and Foreign Affairs, among others.\nHosted by the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology (CMIST)\nRegister for the event",

    "description": "Helene Alving has spent her life suspended in an emotional void after the death of her cruel but outwardly charming husband. She’s about to dedicate an orphanage she has built in his memory, and she reveals to a previous admirer, Pastor Manders, that her marriage was a miserable one. Manders had advised her to return to her husband despite his philandering, and she followed that advice in the belief that her love for her husband would eventually reform him. Now Helene is determined to escape the ghosts of her past by telling her son, Oswald, the truth about his father. But on his return from his life as a painter in France, Oswald has his own secrets to share. As the truth spirals out, Helene and her son must confront the harsh realities of their past, and what it will mean for their future.\nWritten by Henrik Ibsen\nDirected by Carlos E.

The architecture bears testimony to the forces that shaped it, but buildings can only tell part of the stories. The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors. These architectural records document an irretrievable past (for buildings demolished or left unbuilt), facilitate the preservation and reuse of extant buildings, and inform our understanding of our surroundings.\n\nFor the past 40 years, the Architecture Archives collections at Carnegie Mellon University have documented thousands of projects and the work of hundreds of designers. Records have been obtained from architects and their firms, families, property owners, and governments. This wide diversity of materials—preliminary sketches, renderings, specifications, photographs, publications and architectural models—helps piece together the rich history of Pittsburgh and the region.\nVisit the exhibit website to learn more.",
