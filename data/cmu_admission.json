        "content": "Main navigation Utility menu Standardized Testing  Standardized Testing Consideration Carnegie Mellon is test optional for Fall 2025 undergraduate applicants, which means the submission of SAT or ACT results is not required. However, School of Computer Science applicants are strongly encouraged to submit either an SAT or ACT score, including the math subscore. Viewmore details for Fall 2025 applicantsbelow. If you choose to submit scores: note that we allowsuperscoringof SAT test results, but we are unable to accept superscored results for the ACT exam due to the composite score included in the score report. The College Board no longer offers SAT Subject Tests. These test results are neither required nor recommended, and prior scores won’t be considered in our admission process. Standardized Testing Information Fall 2025 Applicants Carnegie Mellon University will be test optional for fall 2025 undergraduate admission applications. However, students applying to the School of Computer Science are strongly encouraged to submit either an SAT or ACT score, including the math subscore, to bolster their application's strength and to aid in determining their ability to succeed academically at Carnegie Mellon. Pursuant to this policy, applicants aren't required to submit SAT or ACT results; however, results will be considered for those who submit them and want us to consider them. We'll continue to review and evaluate our process to make a determination regarding future standardized testing requirements for admission to Carnegie Mellon. Fall 2026 Applicants For Fall 2026 applicants, Carnegie Mellon will implement an undergraduate admission test policy that varies according to college or program: SAT and ACT Tests Carnegie Mellon is extending our test-optional policy, removing the SAT/ACT standardized testing requirement for all Fall 2025 first-year applicants. Please see the information above for more details. We prefer that all testing is completed by November 1 for Early Decision applicants and by January 3 for Regular Decision applicants. We believe that college admission testing in the 9th and 10th grades adds to the anxiety of a process that students won’t encounter for several years. As a result, we encourage students to submit 11th or 12th grade SAT or ACT scores (tests taken the summer after 10th grade are appropriate). While earlier tests may measure knowledge at the time they are taken, that level of knowledge gradually evolves and doesn’t fully represent the knowledge students bring to college first-year courses. Should students present tests taken two or more years in advance of their first-year experience, we'd take the timing of the test results into consideration. The greater the amount of time prior to students' first year of college, the less we can rely on the test results as a fair representation of their knowledge entering Carnegie Mellon. Both domestic and international applicants who choose to submit SAT or ACT scores may share either official or self-reported SAT or ACT scores. Students will not be required to submit official score reports unless they are admitted and choose to enroll. Applicants are able to self-report test scores through the Common Application or by sharing an unofficial score report. Students may also submit a transcript that includes test scores. The Carnegie Mellon SAT code is 2074 and the ACT code is 3534. TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge or Duolingo English Test We require the TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge or Duolingo English Test from all nonnative English speakers.* If English isn't one of your first languages, you must submit official results from one of the following options: IELTS (or IELTS Online): We require at least a 7.5 overall band score on the Academic Examination and give consideration to those with subscores of 7.5 and above. TOEFL iBT or iBT Home Edition: We require at least a 102 overall score and give consideration to those with subscores of 25 and above. TOEFL Essentials: We require at least an 11 overall band score and give consideration to those with subscores of 11 and above. Cambridge English Assessment: We require at least a 191 overall score and give consideration to those with subscores of 191 and above. Duolingo English Test:For those who took the DET prior to July 2024,we require at least a 135 overall score and give consideration to those with the following subscores and above: For those who took the DET during or after July 2024, we require at least a 135 overall score and give consideration to those with the following subscores and above: Scores should be no more than two years old at the time of application, and we prefer that you submit all English proficiency test results from the past two years. Should you take the TOEFL more than once, we'll use the set of TOEFL scores corresponding with your highest overall score. We don't use TOEFL MyBest scores, which ‘superscore’ subsection results from more than one test administration of the TOEFL. Please plan on taking the TOEFL or IELTS no later than December of your senior year. Make sure that the name you use for test registration is identical to the way your name is listed on your passport and in your admissions application. *The TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test/ Cambridge English Assessment will continue to be required for nonnative English speakers for Fall 2025. Holistic Approach Carnegie Mellon is committed to a holistic approach to admission where no single grade, score or activity guarantees or disqualifies any candidate for consideration in the admission review process. We recognize that students bring a variety of strengths and experiences that can positively contribute to the university community, so a wide range of factors are considered when assessing an applicant’s overall potential and fit for CMU.

Many schools will offer information sessions, tours, chats with current students and more to help you learn more about their college. Create your initial list of colleges. Talk to your school counselor about your list and how your grades and exam scores compare to students admitted to those schools. Attend college fairs. A college fair is a gathering of college representatives who are looking to speak about their college to interested high school students. Ask your counselor about how to find college fairs in your area. Take the appropriate standardized tests — if you’re planning to submit scores. Review the standardized testing requirements and recommendations for any colleges you’re considering. Some schools require test scores while others are test-optional or test-blind. Both the College Board (SAT) and the ACT offer fee waivers if you’re concerned about the costs of taking these exams. Senior Year Take the appropriate standardized tests — if you’re planning to submit scores. Review the standardized testing requirements and recommendations for any colleges you’re considering. Some schools require test scores while others are test-optional or test-blind. Both the College Board (SAT) and the ACT offer fee waivers if you’re concerned about the costs of taking these exams. Begin your college applications, making note of application and financial aid deadlines. For each college you’re applying to, decide which application plan you’d like to utilize (Early Decision, Early Action or Regular Decision) and review application requirements. Communicate with your school counselor to make sure that your transcript and letters of recommendation are submitted to all colleges to which you are applying. Continue attending online or in-person college visits. Many schools will also offer evening or weekend sessions in your local area as well. Apply for financial aid. Complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Some colleges, such as Carnegie Mellon, require you to submit aCSS Profilein addition to the FAFSA. Plan to attend an admitted student programfor colleges that offer you admission. College visits held specifically for admitted students can be different from visits held at other times of the year. Make note of deposit deadlines. Each school you’re admitted to will set their own deposit deadline, although for many schools, this date is May 1. You must notify a college of your intention to enroll, usually by submitting a monetary deposit for your first semester’s tuition.

Our creative community is made up of students and faculty who are audaciously creative trailblazers, pushing boundaries to influence and impact the world around them. As a student in the College of Fine Arts, you’ll be the kind empowered to transform your field through critical inquiry and creative production. What to know before you apply Portfolios. Pre-screenings. Auditions. Applying to a school within the College of Fine Arts requires a few extra steps in the application process. Learn more before you submit your application. Portfolio A portfolio allows you to showcase your creative works as part of the application process and will be reviewed by faculty in the Fine Arts program you’re applying to. Your admission decision is based on a holistic review of both that portfolio and your other application materials. At Carnegie Mellon, all visual arts programs and select performing arts programs require a portfolio. Portfolio requirements vary by program, so make sure you review the program-specific information below. If you're applying to multiple programs that require a portfolio, you will need to submit a separate portfolio for each, and the contents of each portfolio should be tailored to the portfolio requirements of each program. Pre-screening A pre-screening is the first part of the audition process for our School of Drama programs. Applicants must complete a pre-screening and then be invited for an audition. Together, the pre-screening and audition are the main basis for your admission decision. Both the pre-screening and audition are specific to the program you’re applying to, so be sure to review the pre-screening information below for the School of Drama. Audition An audition is required for most programs within our Schools of Drama and Music and allows you to showcase your creative talents for the review committee. What’s included in your audition will vary depending on the program you’re applying to, so be sure to carefully review the requirements for your program. Interviews, Essays and More Some programs may have additional application requirements above and beyond the portfolio or audition, including interviews, essays, video submissions, resumes or additional recommendations. These items provide the review committee more context about who you are and your creative abilities. Because requirements vary by program, be sure to carefully review all additional application requirements. College of Fine Arts Additional Application Requirements Each school within the College of Fine Arts has different additional application requirements. Learn more below, and be sure to review the in-depth requirements provided by your program of interest.

        "content": "Main navigation Utility menu Discover Pittsburgh Get into a city built for wonderers and wanderers. The playground of the reliably radical and the predictably unusual. From Pittsburgh’s Point State Park, you can see three different rivers connect. We think that’s a pretty apt metaphor for the entire city — because here, minds of all kinds converge to discover amazing culture, devour eclectic cuisine and engage in work that advances the world. Pittsburgh is a place that’s home to academic paragons and athletic powerhouses, eye-opening cultural experiences and endless adventure — and maybe soon, to you. Innovation and Opportunity This is a city that breeds innovation — a bustling ecosystem of emerging industries that power the economic prosperity of the region, the nation and the world. Technology Robotics and software engineering play a prominent role in the city’s tech scene: Pittsburgh is home to offices for Google, Uber, Intel, Philips, Westinghouse, Thermo Fisher and Apple, as well as a budding ecosystem of tech startups that include Module, BirdBrain Technologies and Gecko Robotics. More than 300,000 people work in the region’s tech-related industries, and thanks to our low cost of living, networking opportunities, “maker” culture and access to small business accelerators, the city is an appealing choice for entrepreneurs and startups. Health care With two of the country's largest hospital systems, Pittsburgh's world-class health care network allows health-related startups like Apollo Neuro and Ocean Genomics to thrive. The city also has a reputation for biomedical innovation — cultivating lifesaving technology, advancing medical devices and developing regenerative medicine and pharmaceuticals. Energy The city has a storied legacy in the energy industry, which accounts for thousands of jobs in the region at companies like Chevron, Eaton, PPG and Shell. Today, there’s a concerted effort to put Pittsburgh at the forefront of energy innovation, with a focus on integrating traditional and alternative energy sources to create solutions that are cleaner and more cost effective. Advanced manufacturing For over a century, the Pittsburgh region’s skilled workforce, outstanding transportation infrastructure and plentiful industrial sites and buildings have made it home to a thriving manufacturing industry. Today, that industry is expanding into growing fields like additive manufacturing, engineering, information technology and robotics. Both global giants and smaller specialty companies are making goods in Pittsburgh — and many are partnering with CMU to make game-changing strides in the process. Culture When you’re not on campus, you’ll find lots of ways to pass the time in Pittsburgh. From eye-opening art exhibits to heart-racing theme parks, there are all kinds of ways to experience the city. Explore a new perspective: Between 90 distinct city neighborhoods and over 86,000 students studying across 10 colleges and universities, Pittsburgh is a prime place for exploration: of places, of cultures and of ideas. Carnegie Mellon is nestled in one of Pittsburgh's oldest neighborhoods. Just swipe your ID, and you’ll gain access to a network of public transportation that will take you anywhere in the city — including free access to many of the city’s prominent cultural institutions, like the Andy Warhol Museum, the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, the National Aviary and the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. Experience the arts: If you’re a culture vulture, Pittsburgh is your kind of place. Enjoy a night at the opera, a concert from the symphony orchestra or a show in the Cultural District. If you’re looking for something more low key, you can cozy up with a book from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which is just a short walk from campus and boasts stunning Beaux Arts architecture.Kick back and let loose: If fun and games are on your itinerary, don’t miss the pinball scene at Kickback, or the board and tabletop gaming options at Games Unlimited. Knock over some pins at Arsenal Bowling and Swissvale Bowl-a-Rama, or try your hand at axe-throwing at Lumberjaxes. Prefer your fun on four wheels? Try skateboarding at Swissvale’s Switch and Signal. Get some fresh air Amid throngs of sports fans donning black and gold (the official colors of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Penguins), you’ll find plenty of green. The Pittsburgh region has 15,000 acres of public parks; 400 miles of biking, hiking and walking trails; and more trees per square mile than any other U.S. city. It’s also home to one of the largest concentrations of certified “green” buildings, including the Phipps Conservatory. Opt for an outdoor adventure and take a walk or bike ride in Point State Park, which sits at the nexus of the city’s three rivers in the heart of downtown. It serves as a waypoint for trails and bike lanes in all directions, including the Great Allegheny Passage, which goes all the way to Washington, D.C. Get some thrills at Kennywood Park, named among the best theme parks in the nation for its old-fashioned atmosphere and first-class roller coaster scene. Or if chills are more your thing, take the bus downtown and glide on the ice at PPG Plaza’s 2,000-square-foot outdoor rink. Or, if you just want to decompress close to campus, take a walk through Schenley Park, a 456-acre green space that’s a popular gathering spot for CMU students and home to our annual Buggy Race. Culinary artistry From eclectic vegan cuisine to stick-to-your-ribs sandwiches, Pittsburgh has made a name for itself as a place of culinary innovation. If you're the kind who appreciates inventive, delicious food, you’ll find plenty of ways to fill your plate. Check out some of our favorites below.

        "content": "Main navigation Utility menu Fall 2025 Admission FAQ  Frequently Asked Questions You and your family may have questions about applying to Carnegie Mellon for Fall 2025. We have answers! We hope the information below will clarify some of our recent policy updates and provide a better understanding of our Admission process. We're here to help, so if you still have questions after browsing, you can reach our office via LiveChat,emailor phone duringnormal business hours. We've joined over 300 other colleges and universities to sign this collective statement from Harvard’sMaking Caring Commonproject. Will first-year applicants be expected to submit SAT or ACT scores? Carnegie Mellon University is extending our test-optional policy through Fall 2025, removing the SAT/ACT standardized testing requirement for all first-year applicants. However, applicants to the School of Computer Scienceare strongly encouraged to submit either an SAT or ACT score, including the math sub-score, to bolster their application's strength and to aid in determining their ability to succeed academically at Carnegie Mellon. Pursuant to this policy, students who are unable to take either the SAT or ACT or choose not to submit their standardized test scores will be considered equally for admission along with those who submit scores. We'll continue to review and evaluate our process to make a determination regarding future standardized testing requirements for admission to Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon is committed to a holistic approach to admission. No single grade, factor, score or activity guarantees or disqualifies any candidate admission to Carnegie Mellon. We treat every applicant as an individual, taking great care to make our admission decisions fairly, thoroughly and in context. We’re interested in students who can be successful at Carnegie Mellon, enrich our campus community and take full advantage of all the university has to offer. Which English proficiency tests do you accept? If English is not a first language for you, you must submit official results from the TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge English Assessment or Duolingo English Test exams. While we only accept the IELTS Academic exam, we accept three versions of the TOEFL: the iBT, the iBT Home Edition and the Essentials exam. To ensure we can consider your scores, all results must still be valid when you submit them. Are SAT Subject Tests required or recommended? The College Board no longer offers SAT Subject Tests. These test results are neither required nor recommended, and prior scores won’t be considered in our admission review process. Which application plans are available for Fall 2025 applicants? Carnegie Mellon offers three different ways to apply: Early Decision, Regular Decision and Transfer Admission. Early Decision: This is for students who know Carnegie Mellon is their first choice and will enroll if admitted. Applications are due November 1 and students are notified by December 15. Regular Decision: Most students choose this plan, as they have until January 2 to apply. Music and Drama applicants must submit their applications by December 1 to leave time to schedule auditions. Transfer Admission: If you've completed a semester of college in a degree-granting program, you can submit your transfer application until February 15. A very limited number of spots may be open for Spring 2025 as well. Please visit ourApplication Deadlinespage for more information. Can I switch my application from Regular to Early Decision? Yes! You can switch your application plan from Regular Decision to Early Decision, as long as you do so before the November 1 Early Decision application deadline. If you decide to participate in Early Decision, we'll send you a decision in December. Am I allowed to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to structure my supplemental essay and improve language? Carnegie Mellon has always been a first mover in the AI space and remains deeply engaged in shaping the future of AI technologies and their uses. As we continue to learn about these tools and lean into their opportunities, we also want to address their challenges. While AI may be a helpful tool in the college admission process, it’s crucial to approach it cautiously. Carnegie Mellon wants to know applicants as individuals, and submitting genuine, authentic application materials can make a significant difference. AI should never replace your unique voice, experiences and personal expression and, if used at all, should only serve as a supplementary tool to enhance your writing (i.e., grammar and spelling checks, suggested structural or vocabulary improvements). Additionally, if the generated content closely resembles published work, there may be a risk of unintentional plagiarism. Carefully consider any and all risks when using generative AI for any part of your application. Are there any additional requirements for application to the College of Fine Arts? All College of Fine Arts applicants must submit additional materials beyond ourgeneral admission requirements. Each School handles pre-screens, auditions, and portfolio reviews slightly differently: Please review ourCollege of Fine Arts Applicants pagefor more information. My course grades were switched to pass/fail during the pandemic. How will this impact my academic review?? We understand and support the move to pass/fail grading options which many schools and colleges adopted as a valid COVID-19 accommodation. As such, we will accept pass/fail results in the normal review of transcripts during this time."

Difference is Strength That’s why welcoming students, faculty and staff from different places, backgrounds and experiences is so important to us. And it’s also why you’ll feel right at home in the Carnegie Mellon community. Opportunity into Action Differing perspectives drive our academic excellence and spirit of innovation. But, in a world where systems have created inherent advantages for some and disadvantages for others, simply recognizing the value of our differences is not enough. At Carnegie Mellon, we’ve made changes to reflect this commitment. Our goal is to ensure that everyone — regardless of background — has the same opportunities from admission through graduation and beyond. If you’re considering Carnegie Mellon, we’d like to consider you Making our admission process more accessible is a journey — one that doesn’t happen overnight. Here are some of the things we’ve done to help eliminate unfair advantages: Our Admission Paradigm Demonstrated Interest Not Considered We do not consider demonstrated interest in our admission paradigm. Demonstrated interest is a term used in undergraduate admission that describes the ways in which a prospective student shows a college that they’re interested by visiting campus and submitting additional materials that aren’t required in the application.As a result, we do not consider a campus visit or communication with the Office of Admission or other members of the Carnegie Mellon community when making admission decisions. Also, we do not accept supplementary submission of materials, including: These extra materials haven't been useful in making our admission decisions and allowing optional materials has deterred some people from applying. Applicants have space on the Common Application to list accomplishments and involvement for the admission committee’s consideration. We encourage students to use this space to share the extracurricular facets of their high school experience. Our Application Process Shorter Essays, Non-Evaluative On-Campus Sessions and Refocused Alumni Efforts Yet even with these changes, there's more work needed on our part to achieve a more accessible process. Issues surrounding standardized testing, for example, are complex in a research university like ours, and while we’re currently SAT/ACT optional, we’re hoping there is more we can do. Our Waiting List Designed to Give Everyone the Opportunity to Respond Efforts to support all students extend to our waiting list process as well. Like many other institutions, we are inundated with demonstrations of continued interest and additional recommendations, mostly from well-resourced or well-advised applicants.Our waiting list process is designed to give everyone who is interested in remaining on our waiting list the opportunity to respond about their uniqueness by sending us a paragraph at the appropriate time, only when we know there are additional places to fill. We request only the paragraph and donotconsider: Details about the paragraph are included in the information made available to all students offered a place on our waiting list when admission decisions are rendered in March. We don't provide the exact topic in advance since we want to avoid having students work on it needlessly in the event we don't end up admitting candidates from our waiting list. United by Our Differences As individuals, we have many kinds of creative talents and intellectual strengths; as a community, we’re the kind of place where people connect across disciplines to make life better for humankind.

        "content": "Main navigation Utility menu Admission Consideration  Building a Class with Tartans of All Kinds At Carnegie Mellon, we select our first-year class from a large group of very qualified candidates. We don’t use a calculation to choose who to admit because calculations can’t take into account all the factors we consider when making admission decisions. No single grade, factor, score or activity will automatically gain or deny you admission to Carnegie Mellon. We treat every applicant as an individual, taking great care to make our admission decisions fair, thorough and sensitive. We’re interested in students who can be successful at Carnegie Mellon while taking full advantage of all the university has to offer. What We Consider Our admission process reflectsCarnegie Mellon's values and core competencies, including diversity, equity, inclusion, collaboration, communication, community engagement, concern for others, self-directed learning and critical thinking. We recommend that you think creatively about how your experiences in and out of the classroom showcase these characteristics. We also encourage you to consider how to share your experiences and aspirations so the admission committee can learn more about you as an applicant, student and person beyond a list of accomplishments. Academic and Creative Potential Our admission process is designed to select a highly talented, diverse undergraduate population with high aspirations who will succeed at Carnegie Mellon. If you’re applying to academic programs, your high school talent and/or potential will be a significant factor in our admission decision because it’s the most meaningful indication of your motivation and abilities. We pay close attention to your curriculum rigor, the grades you’ve earned and the work you’ve accomplished. We’re interested in seeing that you’ve challenged yourself within your secondary school environment. If you’re applying to programs in the College of Fine Arts, your artistic performance will be either the main factor or a significant factor (depending on the program) in our admission decision. Recommendations We closely review your secondary school counselor’s evaluation and your teacher’s recommendation. If you're applying as a first-year student, we require two letters of recommendation: one from a high school counselor and one from a teacher. While we’ll accept a third recommendation from a teacher or other recommender, we require our committees to consider only two recommendations in the decision-making process. When choosing a teacher to write your recommendation, be sure to choose someone who can speak to your academic abilities, achievements and broader personal characteristics. It doesn't have to be a teacher in the academic area you're applying to; rather, it should be the teacher who knows you the best. If you're applying as a transfer student, we require one letter of recommendation from either a faculty member/professor or an academic advisor. While we’ll accept two additional recommendations, we require our committees to consider only one recommendation in the decision-making process. Standardized Testing Standardized test scores add to our knowledge of your ability, but we don’t make decisions simply on the basis of test scores alone. Carnegie Mellon University is test optional for Fall 2025 undergraduate admission applications. However, students applying to the School of Computer Science are strongly encouraged to submit either an SAT or ACT score, including the math subscore, to bolster their application's strength and to aid in determining their ability to succeed academically at Carnegie Mellon. Pursuant to this policy, applicants aren't required to submit SAT or ACT results; however, results will be considered for those who submit them.Students who are unable to take either the SAT or ACT or choose not to submit their standardized test scores will be considered equally for admission along with those who submit scores.Learn more. Please also note that submission of any prior SAT Subject Test results won’t be considered in our admission review process. Activities, Experiences & Passions Your non-academic interests, including extracurricular accomplishments, part-time jobs, hobbies and community service also play a very important role in the admission process. We also consider leadership, motivation, passion and perseverance, concern and advocacy for others, and other experiences when making admission decisions. Our students make Carnegie Mellon an exciting campus. The positive qualities and diverse experiences you bring with you will enrich our community. By looking at this non-academic information, we develop a sense of your personality, motivation and social responsibility. Essays We also consider your Common Application essay and your responses to the Carnegie Mellon Common Application Writing Supplement. The Writing Supplement includes three short-answer questions: Your short answer responses shouldn't exceed 300 words each. While there's no such thing as the perfect essay, the best essay you can write helps us learn about you! We want to know more about your passions, goals, aspirations and experiences to gain a deeper understanding of who you are beyond your transcript. While role models, mentors and family members may have played a critical role in your life, don’t forget to write about you. Finally, it’s important to recognize that you apply directly to a college or school within Carnegie Mellon, so we encourage you to use part of your essays to describe your academic interests and goals.  If you want to learn more about our wide range of programs, you can check out ourvisit opportunitiesto attend an information session or schedule a one-on-one meeting with an admission counselor. Carnegie Mellon does not collect or review criminal history information as part of the admission process. However, individuals who are admitted to Carnegie Mellon will be required to disclose any past criminal conviction as part of the enrollment process. Learn how Carnegie Mellon considerscriminal history information. Striving for Access and Equity in Admission The mission of Carnegie Mellon University includes the cultivation of a diverse and inclusive community. Our undergraduate admission process is committed to reducing or eliminating advantages that have been inherent in the admission process. The goal is to provide a more equitable, level playing field where all segments of our applicant population have the same opportunity in the admission process. Our Admission Paradigm DEMONSTRATED INTEREST NOT CONSIDERED We do not consider demonstrated interest in our admission paradigm.
