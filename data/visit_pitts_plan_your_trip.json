It’s a very drivable city if you have a car. Or, you can easily order an Uber or Lyft if you arrived by Amtrak. Best of all, parking is plentiful around your favorite spots. If you love art and museums, this is your town. The Andy Warhol Museum on the North Shore reflects the Pittsburgh-born artist’s life with an eccentric artistic touch. Make sure you catch a glimpse of one of his most famous pieces, Campbell’s Soup Cans. You also can view many of his personal items, including a collection of wigs. Head across town to The Frick Pittsburgh in Point Breeze to enjoy a legacy of art, history and nature. The Car and Carriage Museum, included in The Frick’s free admission, is a ride through history. Plan accordingly so you can take your time and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the mansion, the museum and garden areas. Up for more walking? Make sure you include a visit to the Strip District where you’ll find a variety of shopping, including lots of black and gold merchandise, eclectic food and restaurant offerings and gift shops. Be on the lookout for The Strip Mural by artists Carley Parris and Shannon Pultz – it’s easily viewed on Penn Ave. For those wishing to savor all the flavors of the Strip District – or a handful of other Pittsburgh neighborhoods – consider booking a walking food tour with ‘Burgh Bits & Bites. Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins, and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams. You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum. The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh’s most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country. When your legs need a respite from walking, rest assured there are several more relaxing ways to see the city. Book a tour on Molly’s Trolleys Pittsburgh. Not only will you visit several neighborhoods and see many of the city’s popular sites, but thanks to the fantastic tour guides, you also will learn a bit of regional history. One such nugget learned on a recent trip - ketchup wasn’t the first Heinz product produced; bottled horseradish was! Ride the Duquesne Incline up to the Mount Washington neighborhood for a spectacular view of the city. A quick ride back down will drop you off in the South Side neighborhood. Pittsburgh is widely known for its three rivers. Tour the city by water aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet. Sit back and relax on the Three Rivers Sightseeing Cruise, which allows visitors a close view of the Downtown skyline and several of the city’s 446 bridges. And, the sunset cruises are a great option for a romantic night out. Speaking of those bridges, many of them are easily walkable, connecting Downtown to several of Pittsburgh’s 90 unique neighborhoods. In fact, the Sixth Street Bridge, commonly known as the Clemente Bridge, directly takes you from Downtown to PNC Park, home of the Pirates. Consider extending your Pittsburgh visit with a daytrip to the Laurel Highlands, where you can visit two of Frank Lloyd Wright’s most iconic homes, Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob. Visiting these residences is like stepping back in time, as the décor reflects the decade each house was built. When available, make sure you book a guided tour, as they provide an insider’s look at Mr. Wright’s thought processes, as well as the homeowners’. Visitors have their pick of comfortable lodging options in Pittsburgh, including several that are housed in historical buildings, like the Drury Plaza Hotel Pittsburgh Downtown which is a beautiful renovation of the Federal Reserve Bank building. Many pieces remain from the original bank including vault doors estimated to weigh 34 tons each. The property is located Downtown and within easy walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and Union Station. The Omni William Penn Hotel also makes for a lovely stay. The iconic hotel is home to Lawrence Welk’s original bubble machine. Plus, it’s also where Bob Hope proposed to his wife, Delores.

Pittsburgh is one of the most fertile breeding grounds for icons of the culture. In 2008 Nelson E. Harrison, Ph.D. created jazzburgher.ning.com, representing the region's historical and geographic significance in order to offer the perfect atmosphere for the education, presentation, documentation, archiving, production and research of the performing art of jazz and its related musical forms. The site is designed to attract the consciousness of researchers, young people and the world-at-large to the significant contributions of Pittsburghers and stand as a living monument to the cultural excellence spawned in Pittsburgh's communities and celebrated around the world by countless millions. The Crawford Grille #2 There remains one venue symbolic of this nature, closed to the public since December 2003 but thankfully designated as a historical landmark on the National Registry in 2020, that has the iconic cultural and historical significance to attract tourists and visitors from around the globe as a “first day” event upon its restoration – The Crawford Grill #2. It served as a Spirit House for the music for 60 years and was the focal point of the creative inspiration and interaction of countless artists who gathered there regularly. Located at 2141 Wylie Ave. in the Hill District, Crawford Grill #2 has been consecrated by human experience, creativity, emotions and music. While it was open, it was a melting pot of true diversity where peace prevailed despite whatever may have been happening outside of its walls. No town could boast a finer night life than Pittsburgh in the ‘20s, ‘30s, ‘40s and ‘50s. This is one reason so many jazz legends were produced during those years. The construction of the now erstwhile Mellon Arena effectuated the simultaneous bulldozing of the richest repository of Pittsburgh's jazz legacy, the lower Hill District. If the legacy is to be perpetuated, a means must be available to hold the memories of a fertile atmosphere long since lost and scarcely remembered. In addition, young people between the ages of 18-40 need a way to experience the music in some way as it as it is meant to be enjoyed. Although the Crawford Grill remains as a silent monument awaiting resurrection in the name of the spirits that still resonate in its shadows, there is no better venue that represents that era and tradition. Mary Lou Williams in her apartment with Jack Teagarden, Tadd Dameron, Hank Jones and Dizzy Gillespie The creators and master craftsmen of this music who have truly touched our hearts and helped to shape our lives with their artistry are truly an endangered species. It is a modern-day tragedy that their stories remain untold and become lost forever upon their passing from life. The master craftsmen of the 1920s and 1930s are almost all gone today. Among the survivors, there are few well enough and available to tell their stories. Future generations need to know that this great music came from the people (not the steel mills, the water or the geography) and who they were. Make Time and Explore Modern technologies now give us an opportunity to have and use many online resources to explore the treasured artistry of the many legends associated with the Pittsburgh tradition, discover and cull the evidence that will support the following assertion: \"If New Orleans is accepted to be the birthplace of jazz, then Pittsburgh is its Fort Knox.\" The following are some names to start your research: Earl \"Fatha\" HinesBilly EckstineMary Lou WilliamsBilly StrayhornBilly MayRoy EldridgeKenny ClarkeArt BlakeyRay BrownErroll GarnerAhmad JamalSammy NesticoStanley TurrentineGeorge BensonDakota StatonJoe HarrisMaxine SullivanBarry GalbraithDodo MarmarosaGrover MitchellEddie JeffersonPhyllis HymanBob BabbittSlide HamptonLena HorneLeroy BrownJoe WestrayPaul ChambersRoger HumphriesJohn HeardMickey BassRon AnthonyJoe PassMusa KaleemJoe Kennedy, Jr.Steve NelsonPeter MatzCecil Brooks, IIILou BlackburnEddie SafranskiCutty CutshallSyreeta WrightBob CooperJimmy PonderHorace ParlanJoe NegriAdam WadeJohnny CostaChuck JacksonEdgar WillisTommy TurkThe Variety ClubRalph LalamaRay CrawfordSammy NesticoSteve GrossmanBill ToleDarrell GrantPerry ComoGene KellyJester HairstonSonny ClarkJeff \"Tain\" WattsBeaver HarrisJ.C. MosesHenry Mancini Nelson E. Harrison is a Ph. D. in clinical psychology, educator, composer, archivist, lyricist, arranger, ASCAP, speaker and veteran trombonist of the Count Basie Orchestra. He speaks music as a native language and his lyrical skills have been endorsed by a significant number of major jazz composers and vocalists. He assumed the challenge of continuing the vocalese repertoire by lyricizing 125 selected bop tunes by iconic composers thus making their music more accessible to singers. In 1999 Nelson self-published \"The World According to Bop,\" his first anthology of original lyrics to 88 bebop and hard bop. Dr. Harrison has been an active professional musician for 62 years and has interacted and or played with hundreds of major artists and composers."
