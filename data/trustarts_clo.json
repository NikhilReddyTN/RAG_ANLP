    "performer": "Pittsburgh CLO",
    "content": "Journey to a mystical realm where thrones are won through power, love, and betrayal — and swords decide the fate of kings — a kingdom's destiny hangs in the balance. Lerner and Loewe’s timeless musical masterpiece plunges us into the legendary love triangle between King Arthur, Queen Guenevere, and the valiant Sir Lancelot. Their passions and loyalties will shape the rise and fall of Arthur's realm. Yet, as with all great legends, the dream of Lerner & Loewe's​ CAMELOT may come at a cost — as the quest for love and honor clashes with the pursuit of power. Revered as a legendary triumph on Broadway, this epic tale of knights and royalty has captivated audiences of all generations. The show’s haunting ballads and stirring anthems, including “If Ever I Would Leave You,” “I Loved You Once in Silence,” and “The Lusty Month of May,” echo across the ages proving why legends endure and speak to us today.
