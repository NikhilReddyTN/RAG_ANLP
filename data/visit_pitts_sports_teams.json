The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\" In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.Known for 5× Super Bowl champion (IX, X, XIII, XIV, XL) 5× AFC champion (1974, 1975, 1978–79 NFL playoffs, 1979, 2005) Sports commentary careerTeamPittsburgh SteelersSportAmerican football Myron Sidney Kopelman (January 23, 1929 – February 27, 2008), known professionally as Myron Cope, was an American sports journalist, radio personality, and sportscaster. He is best known for being \"the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers\". Cope was a color commentator for the Steelers' radio broadcasts for 35 years. He was known for his distinctive, higher-pitched nasally voice with an identifiable Pittsburgh accent, idiosyncratic speech pattern, and a level of excitement rarely exhibited in the broadcast booth. Cope's most notable catch phrase was \"yoi\"[2] /ˈjɔɪ/. He helped popularize the Terrible Towel, a rally towel associated with the Steelers. In 1996, Cope gave the rights to the towel to Allegheny Valley School, which has received more than $6 million in proceeds from towel sales. Cope was the first football announcer inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.[3] Cope's autobiography, Double Yoi!, was published in 2002.[4] Education and career[edit] Cope as a student at the University of Pittsburgh in 1950 Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents of Lithuanian ancestry, Cope graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1947 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2009.[5][6] He also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh.[7] Cope was originally a journalist before becoming a broadcaster. His first job as a journalist was in Erie, Pennsylvania, with the Daily Times,[8] and by the summer of 1951, he was working for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.[9] Cope then became a freelance journalist, most notably for Sports Illustrated,[1] the Saturday Evening Post,[8] and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.[3] In 1963, Cope received the E.P. Dutton Prize for \"Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation\", for a portrayal of Cassius Clay.[10] Cope spent the 1983 college football season as a color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers.[7] In 1987, he was named by the Hearst Corporation as a noted literary achiever, along with Mark Twain, Jack London, Frederic Remington, Walter Winchell, and Sidney Sheldon.[10] At its 50th anniversary, Sports Illustrated selected Cope's profile of Howard Cosell as one of the 50 best written works ever published in the magazine.[3] Steelers broadcasting[edit] Cope waves a Terrible Towel at Heinz Field – October 31, 2005 In 1968, Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh.[11] His unique nasal voice, with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent, was noticed by the Steelers' brass, and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers' radio team in 1970.[12] During Cope's 35-year broadcasting career with the Steelers—the second longest term with a single team in NFL history, he was accompanied by only two play-by-play announcers: Jack Fleming, with whom he broadcast until 1994, and Bill Hillgrove.[8][13] In keeping with his comic personality, a series of television commentaries on WTAE-TV saw Cope calling himself \"Doctor Cope\" and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team's strengths and weaknesses. His predictor was known as the \"Cope-ra-scope.\"[14] In his last seven years, Cope would work alongside former Steelers offensive tackle Tunch Ilkin in the booth and help groom him for his own broadcasting career. Ilkin, upon his own retirement in 2021 due to complications from ALS (which he would later die from on September 4, 2021), later joked that while he learned a lot from riding in the car with Cope for away games, Cope primarily rode with him because he allowed Cope to smoke cigarettes in the car.[15] Ilkin would eventually serve as a de facto replacement for Cope following Cope's retirement. Catchphrases and nicknames[edit] Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh, particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince, Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts, such as \"Mmm-Hah!\" (when he loses his train of thought, or forgets a player's name) and \"Okel Dokel\" (his version of \"okey dokey\").[8] Cope often used Yiddish expressions, especially \"Feh!\" and \"Yoi!\" (sometimes multiplied as \"Double Yoi\" or rarely \"Triple Yoi\"). Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams. It was Cope who popularized \"The Bus\" as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, \"Jack Splat\" for Jack Lambert, and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname \"Slash.\"[16] Cope also used the term \"Cincinnati Bungles\" to describe their division rivals, known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts.[17][18][19] Myron also used terms such as \"Brownies\", \"Birdies\", \"Yonkos\", \"Cryboys\", and \"Redfaces\" for the football teams from Cleveland, Baltimore, Denver, Dallas, Washington, D.C., in respective order.[20][21][22][23] Cope was noted for accusing future Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente of being \"baseball's champion hypochondriac\".[24] Terrible Towel[edit] Main article: Terrible Towel I said, what we need is something that everybody already has, so it doesn't cost a dime. So I says, 'We'll urge people to bring out to the game gold or black towels,' then I'll tell people if you don't have a yellow, black or gold towel, buy one. And if you don't want to buy one, dye one. We'll call this the Terrible Towel. — Myron Cope on the invention of the Terrible Towel[25] Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel.[26] Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts, Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout.[25] Originally, Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks, but realizing the high costs for the masks, opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel. The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and \"is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team\".[26] The catchphrase is: \"The Terrible Towel is poised to strike, and so are The Steelers.\" In 1996, Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania.[27] The school provides care for more than 900 people[28] with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities, including Cope's son who has severe autism.[2] Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $6 million for the school.[29] Family life[edit] Cope married Mildred Lindberg of Charleston in 1965, and the couple moved to Mt. Lebanon.[30] In 1972, the Copes moved to nearby Upper St. Clair.[31] Mildred died on September 20, 1994.[9] In 1999, Cope moved back to Mt. Lebanon, to a condo in the Woodridge neighborhood.[31] He remained there until his final days, when he entered a Mt. Lebanon nursing home.[8] Cope had three children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel.[9] Martha Ann died shortly after her birth.[13] His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School, an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities.[27] Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism, and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism.[27] Retirement and death[edit] A special edition of \"The Terrible Towel\" was created in honor of Cope's retirement following the 2005 Steelers' season. Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20, 2005, citing health concerns.[32] Eight days later, it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for \"long-time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football.\"[33] Upon his retirement, the Steelers did not replace Cope, opting instead to downsize to a two-man broadcast team.[13] On October 31, 2005, Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens.[34] In addition, the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it. As seen on the towel, production was limited to 35,000 towels, representing 35 years of service to the Steelers. Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL, many Steelers fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call \"The one for the thumb.\" Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement.[citation needed] A longtime heavy smoker, Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt. Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27, 2008.[13][35] In the days following his death, many ceremonies were held in his honor, including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team.[36] Two days after his death, hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving.[37] His funeral, which was held on February 29, 2008, was private.[38] Due to Cope's large impact on the Pittsburgh area, Bob Smizik, a local sportswriter wrote, Had the secret of the service and its site not been kept, ... tens of thousands would have descended on the Slater funeral home in Green Tree. Such was the affection for Cope, ... that the parkway in both directions would have been clogged. Greentree and Cochran roads, the two main arteries leading to the funeral home, would have been parking lots.[38] List of awards and honors[edit] Football in the Steelers Hall of Honor dedicated to Cope, 2023 Cope received many awards and honors, including: 1963 – E.P. Dutton Prize for \"Best Magazine Sportswriting in the Nation\" for his portrayal of Cassius Clay[3] 1987 – Named as a noted literary achiever by Hearst Corporation[3] 2004 – His profile of Howard Cosell was selected as one of 50 all-time classic articles by Sports Illustrated[3] 2005 – Became the first pro football announcer elected to the Radio Hall of Fame,[3] he is the only sportscaster inducted who is not best known as a baseball announcer. 2005 – Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award for long-time exceptional contributions to pro football in television and radio[33] 2015 – Pittsburgh Pro Football Hall of Fame 2022 - Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Honor Held the title of \"special contributor\" at Sports Illustrated[3] Served as a board member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Autism Society of America and the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix[3] Co-founded the Myron Cope/Foge Fazio Golf Tournament for Autistic Children[3] The only broadcaster appointed to the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Board of Selectors, serving for 10 years[3] The asteroid 7835 Myroncope was named in his honor in 2008.[39][40] Bibliography[edit] Brown, Jim; Myron Cope (1964).

Skip to main content Book Your Stay Book Your Stay Back Your Ultimate Guide to Pittsburgh Steelers Training Camp Jul. 24, 2019 Updated for 2023 Steelers Training Camp The Pittsburgh Steelers return to the Laurel Highlands July 27-August 17 for Steelers Training Camp at Saint Vincent College for the 56th year, and GO Laurel Highlands will be there! Visit our booth near the Steelers Pro Shop and the FedEx Air & Ground Zone. We've put together some tips to help you meet the players, avoid the crowds, and stay cool as you enjoy watching the Black and Gold prepare for a winning season. (For more general information about dates and what to pack, view our Steelers Training Camp page). Get in the Game The first step is acquiring a ticket to attend camp. Admission to practice is free, but fans must have a mobile ticket to enter. Tickets are available here. Share on Social If you're on-site at Saint Vincent College you have the opportunity to be recognized on the Steelers' social media platforms. When the gates open, look for the camera set up in the fan experience area and answer the Steelers Nation Unite Question of the Day for a chance to be featured on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok! You can also scan one of the QR codes posted around the fan experience area using your mobile device to submit your photos of your trip to Saint Vincent. Don't forget the #LaurelHighlands. When to Arrive, Where to Park Give yourself plenty of time to get to Saint Vincent. For practices starting at 1:55 p.m., the campus opens to all fans at 11 a.m. Early arrival is encouraged. Free parking is available for all fans visiting Steelers Training Camp. The parking lot entrance is located at the intersection of Saint Vincent Drive and Brouwers Road and is clearly marked by camp directional signage. ADA parking can be found in the Fred Rogers Center Parking Lot on 300 Fraser Purchase Rd, Latrobe, PA 15650. Once you have arrived on campus, there will be signage directing you to the designated ADA lot. *You must have a Disability Parking Placard to be permitted. Greet the Steelers as They Come to the Field The Steelers usually come to the field 5-10 minutes before practice begins. Line up just below the stairs and along the fence from the Carey Center/SVC Bookstore. Players usually don't sign autographs before practice, but will often talk to fans, high-five or stop for a selfie. To get the best spots, plan on arriving 30 minutes to an hour before practice begins. The best spot for autographs Autographs aren't a guarantee at Steelers Training Camp, so follow these tips to increase your chances of success. While many players rush down to the field at the beginning of practice, many will hang around after practice to sign memorabilia or pose for photos. If you're sitting on the hillside at Saint Vincent, we recommend coming all the way down to the fence line. You can also hang out below the bookstore, which is where players will pass to get back to the locker room. Remember to have some pens and markers handy and keep your phone camera turned to selfie mode so you are ready to meet your favorite player when you get the chance! Stay Informed with What's Happening Even when you can't be in Latrobe, you can follow all of the action. Download the official Steelers mobile app and find on-demand programming at Steelers.com. Meet Fan Favorite Merril Hoge at GO LH Booth You'll want to head to camp early on July 29 for a chance to meet and get a photo with former Steelers running back Merril Hoge from 11 am to 1 pm at the GO Laurel Highlands booth near the Steelers Pro Shop and the FedEx Air & Ground Zone! Hoge played seven seasons in Pittsburgh, rushing for 3,115 yards and 21 touchdowns during that span. Friday Night Lights If you're looking for an all-day Steelers experience perfect for families, be sure to attend Friday Night Lights Aug. 4 at Latrobe Memorial Stadium. Tickets will go on sale at 11 a.m. at the stadium and can be purchased throughout the day. Tickets also can be purchased at the booths when the gates open at 5 p.m. Arrive early and experience Latrobe Fest from 11 a.m.-5 p.m.! This event will feature the Steelers Experience, outdoor activities, vendors, food, music, and fun for the entire family. Steelers Legend autograph signings will take place from 3-4 p.m. and 4-5 p.m. Admission to Latrobe Fest is free to all! In the evening, head inside the stadium and cheer on the Steelers as they practice under the lights! Then, enjoy a fireworks display after practice concludes around 9 p.m. Bring your kids Training Camp is much more than practice and autographs. There are tons of activities for children to participate in, too! Sign up for the Play 60 Fun Zone for one hour of football-themed exercise before practice begins. At the entrance to camp, you'll find the Steelers Experience where kids can test their arms, dive through an obstacle course and more. Plus, kids will love getting their faces painted and the Steelers-themed photo booth. Enter to win Steelers tickets Stop by the GO Laurel Highlands booth and register to win two tickets to the October 29 game vs the Jacksonville Jaguars. Snap a selfie, get some great free Laurel Highlands swag and find out more about the coolest places to hang out around the area! Explore Saint Vincent College While you're on campus, be sure to check out the unique sights at Saint Vincent College. Tour the amazing architecture of the iconic Basilica. Pick up some flour made right at the Gristmill. Learn about the legacy of Latrobe native Fred Rogers, star of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, at an interactive exhibit. Stay outside and walk the scenic Winnie Palmer Nature Reserve trail system or wetlands. End your day with a show at Saint Vincent Summer Theatre. For more tips about exploring the college, check out their blog. Eat and Drink Local It's hard work to sit out in the sun and cheer for the black and gold. Reward yourself with some great food and beer in and around the Latrobe area. Start with a frosty beer at Four Seasons Brewing right across the road, with 16 rotating drafts and live music and food trucks on select weekends. Stop by Jioio's Restaurant in Latrobe for their one-of-a-kind pizza with sweet sauce and pastry-style crust, unique to our area. Or hit up Dino's or Sharky's, two sports bars just a few minutes from Saint Vincent. Both offer great menus, a large beer selection, and some world-famous wings.

The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\" In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

        "title": "History of the Steelmark - American Iron and Steel Institute",
        "content": "History of the Steelmark - American Iron and Steel Institute American Iron and Steel Institute History of the Steelmark The Steelers logo is based on the Steelmark logo belonging to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). Created by the United States Steel Corporation (also referred to as U. S. Steel), the logo contains three hypocycloids (diamond shapes). The three hypocycloids mean: steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure and widens your world. They also represent the three materials used to produce steel: yellow for coal, orange for iron ore and blue for steel scrap. In the 1950s, when helmet logos became popular, the Steelers added players’ numbers to either side of their gold helmets. Later that decade, the numbers were removed and in 1962, Cleveland’s Republic Steel suggested to the Steelers that they use the Steelmark as a helmet logo. When the Steelmark logo was created, U. S. Steel attached the following meaning to it: Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure and widens your world. The logo was used as part of a major marketing campaign to educate consumers about how important steel is in our daily lives. The Steelmark logo was used in print, radio and television ads as well as on labels for all steel products, from steel tanks to tricycles to filing cabinets. In the 1960s, U. S. Steel turned over the Steelmark program to the AISI, where it came to represent the steel industry as a whole. During the 1970s, the logo’s meaning was extended to include the three materials used to produce steel: yellow for coal, orange for ore and blue for steel scrap. In the late 1980s, when the AISI founded the Steel Recycling Institute (SRI), the logo took on a new life reminiscent of its 1950s meaning. The Steelers had to petition the AISI in order to change the word “Steel” inside the Steelmark to “Steelers” before the logo was complete. The Steelers are the only NFL team that sports their logo on only one side of the helmet. At first, this was a temporary measure because the Steelers weren’t sure they would like the look of the logo on an all-gold helmet. They wanted to test them before going all-out. Equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to put the logo only on one side of the helmet – the right side. The 1962 Steelers finished 9-5 and became the winningest team in franchise history to date. The team finished second in the Eastern Conference and qualified for the Playoff Bowl. They wanted to do something special for their first postseason game, so they changed the color of their helmets from gold to black, which helped to highlight the new logo. Because of the interest generated by having the logo on only one side of their helmets and because of their team’s new success, the Steelers decided to leave it that way permanently. Today’s helmet reflects the way the logo was originally applied and it has never been changed.

About the Man Roberto Clemente was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954 and rose to become the greatest baseball player of his time. During this period, the struggle for social justice had reached every part of our country, and every ballpark. He and many other athletes had to bear the burdens of racial and cultural prejudices, no matter what their abilities were on the field. He faced those burdens with dignity, pride and an empathy for those less fortunate. As for his critics, he silenced them with his amazing bat and miraculous arm. In his 18-year career, he received every possible award given in Major League Baseball. Off the field, he built a reputation as a humanitarian, with a passion to help children through sports.

W League in 2025 News Team Announcements The Howler USL News W League ExpansionRiverhounds StaffApril 27, 2024 7:00 pmShare TAMPA, Fla. — The United Soccer League today announced that the Pittsburgh Riverhounds ownership group has established a USL W League team which is slated to start competing in the 2025 season. The team’s official crest and identity will be unveiled in the coming months. The addition of a W League team will provide a pathway for women in Pittsburgh to compete at an elite level. The Riverhounds Development Academy has been active since 2007, with its first girls’ academy team forming in 2012. “As we experience the remarkable growth of women’s soccer globally, it’s imperative that we not only acknowledge, but actively champion the immense talent and passion that exists within our own communities,” Riverhounds President Jeff Garner said. “By establishing a pathway for girls in our region to pursue the highest levels of soccer, particularly those emerging from our esteemed Riverhounds Development Academy, we are not just creating opportunities, we are fulfilling dreams.” The year the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC is celebrating its 25th anniversary, after being established in 1999 as a men’s professional team in the then USL A League. Following the formation of the Development Academy, the club expanded, now fielding teams from U-9 to U-19 age groups within multiple leagues, including USL Academy and Elite Clubs National League. “As our Academy has grown and flourished on the girls’ side, the need to create a First Team pathway for the young women in our city has become increasingly evident,” said Riverhounds Sporting Director Dan Visser. “We couldn’t be more excited to bring a W League team to Pittsburgh!” The club also partakes in various community initiatives in efforts to fulfill its mission “to cultivate and promote the sport of soccer within the Pittsburgh area, fostering a vibrant and inclusive community of players, fans and supporters.” Some activations include soccer-focused physical education programming in local schools led by Riverhounds coaches and charity walks at Highmark Stadium, the home site for Riverhounds matches. “We are thrilled to have Pittsburgh Riverhounds join the USL W League for the 2025 season,” said Joel Nash, USL Senior Vice President of Youth and Pre-Professional Properties. “Pittsburgh has decades of history in the American soccer landscape, and we’re excited to see their passionate fans support this W League team next summer.” Stay up to date with Riverhounds SC’s social channels on Facebook, Twitter/X and Instagram for updates on branding, technical staff and more ahead of kickoff in 2025.
