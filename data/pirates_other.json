Check In Official Check In An Official Check-in occurs when you scan a ticket for entry, or have location services enabled, or by manually checking in from the Team Page while at the ballpark. Checking in to a game will allow you to unlock exclusive ballpark offers as well as exclusive content on the Team tab that may only be accessible while in the stadium (e.g., voting).

If you believe an error has occurred, you can tap on the \"Refresh\" button to refresh the information for the app to attempt to better locate you. Accessing Unlocked Offers Once an Official Check-in has occurred, fans can access unlocked offers directly in their Inbox. For more details on accessing and unlocking offers after a check-in, see the Offers section. Historic Check-In Time to pull out all those old ticket stubs!

These features can be found in the \"Tickets\" tab, \"Wallet\" section or on the \"Home\" tab for upcoming games. Tickets will display a rotating barcode that automatically refreshes every few seconds, which helps ensure that your tickets are secure and cannot be stolen or duplicated. So, heads up that screenshots will no longer be accepted at gate entrances! Purchasing Tickets Tap on the \"Tickets\" tab in the bottom navigation bar and select \"Buy Tickets\". Make sure you have the correct team selected, or tap on the team name filter to change. Select the game for which you want to buy tickets by tapping on a row with the green ticket icon. Select your seats. Provide account and payment information. Review and complete your purchase. Verifying Accounts and Accessing Tickets Why verify my email? In order to access and manage tickets in the MLB Ballpark app, fans must verify their email, regardless of whether the tickets were purchased or received through a ticket forward. By verifying your email you confirm ownership of the MLB account and associated tickets. How do I verify my email? Fans need to login with an MLB account the first time they open the MLB Ballpark app. If you don't have an existing MLB account, you can create one as part of the initial onboarding process. Fans who view the \"Home\" or \"Tickets\" tabs without a verified account will be prompted to \"Please verify your email address or refresh your tickets\". Fans can request a verification email be sent to verify their MLB account OR add an email address under \"Profile\" and \"My MLB Account Emails\" to link the email associated with their tickets. All MLB Account Emails must be verified in order to access tickets associated with that email. Upon requesting a verification email, an email will be sent to that address asking you to verify that address by tapping on a one-time link. How can I remove a verified account? During the verification process, if you've added an incorrect email address OR would like to remove a secondary account that you've previously linked, you can do so within the app. Go to the \"Home\" tab in the bottom navigation bar, and click on the avatar icon or your initials in the upper left-hand corner to go to your \"Profile.\" Click on \"My MLB Email Account Emails,\" where you can see any emails that are linked and their verification status. Tap on \"Remove\", which will unlock all verified emails with a minus button next to each. Tap on the minus icon next to the email address(es) you wish to remove. Confirm that you want to remove the account by tapping the \"Remove\" button at the right of the email address. Important Note: While you can remove secondary email addresses, users cannot remove their primary email address (the one used to login to the MLB Ballpark app). How do I access my tickets? Ticket Purchasers To find your purchases in the MLB Ballpark app, go to the \"Tickets\" tab and click \"Wallet\" to view the Event card for the ticket(s) that you purchased. If you don't see the Event card, tap on \"Refresh\" or pull down on the screen to refresh your ticketing inventory. Event cards will display for the next 5 upcoming events in your Wallet. For fans with more than 5 events in their inventory, tap the \"View All\" link on the top right of the wallet to view all upcoming events. Event cards will populate provided that the email address associated with those tickets is both a) linked with your MLB account, and b) you have verified your ownership over that email.

FEDERAL STREET Along Federal Street, you'll find: Roberto Clemente statue in Center Field The Roberto Clemente statue was dedicated on July 8, 1994, to kick off All-Star Week in Pittsburgh. It was originally erected outside Gate A at Three Rivers Stadium and is now located outside the Center Field Gate to PNC Park, a few steps away from the Roberto Clemente Bridge. Willie Stargell statue in Left Field Unveiled on April 7, 2001, the 12-foot bronze statue stands along Federal Street at the entrance to left field at PNC Park. MAZEROSKI WAY On Mazeroski Way, you'll find: Bill Mazeroski statue at the end of the cul-de-sac in Right Field As part of the 50th anniversary season of the 1960 World Series Championship, the 12-foot bronze statue was officially unveiled on September 5, 2010, and stands at the end of Mazeroski Way, which is located at the right field entrance to PNC Park. At the corner of Mazeroski Way and General Robinson Street, you’ll find: Honus Wagner statue at the Home Plate entrance The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park. Official Info Help/Contact Us Accessibility Job Opportunities Corporate Partnerships"

It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887. This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort. Location PNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages. Design The facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh. PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line. PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond. The home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years. Features Among the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices. Playing Field The irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches. The Pirates and the Park Perhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come.

After you've confirmed that the tickets were purchased with an email address that is verified on the My MLB Account Emails page (accessible by tapping the Profile icon in the top left hand corner of the Home Tab and then tapping My MLB Account Emails) and that your Pirates ticket account is displaying on the Ticket Accounts page, you may need to refresh your Tickets tab’s Wallet by pulling down on the screen to see updated ticket inventory. arrow-up-39034 Back to Top MLB BALLPARK APP - TICKET WALLET What is the Ticket Wallet? The Ticket Tab’s Wallet provides you with quick access and management of all of your MLB tickets. After downloading the MLB Ballpark app, click the Tickets icon on the bottom tab to see all of the tickets you own. Can I see all my tickets for all teams within the Wallet, or just one team at a time? You will be able to access your tickets to any MLB team's game or event as long as you used the same MLB account or email address to purchase the tickets. Where can I see more event details about the game? In the team page accessed via the bottom tab bar, you can find detailed information about the day's event. What if I cannot find tickets I purchased or tickets that were forwarded to me? First confirm that the tickets were purchased with an email address that is verified on the My MLB Account Emails page which is accessible by tapping the Profile icon in the top left hand corner of the Home Tab and then tapping My MLB Account Emails. Next, confirm that a Pirates ticket account is displaying on the My Ticket Accounts page. If there is not a Pirates ticket account listed, and you’re certain that the email address you have verified in MLB Account is correct then please contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. Note that you may need to refresh your Tickets tab by pulling down on the screen to see updated ticket inventory. If your Pirates tickets were originally forwarded to you by another Ballpark app user, the original sender may have canceled the forward and you should check with the person who sent you the tickets. If you are still having difficulty locating mobile tickets you believe should be appearing in your Tickets tab, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. Which types of tickets will be displayed in the MLB Ballpark app? The MLB Ballpark app displays regular season, Postseason, Spring Training and other event tickets within the Tickets tab’s Wallet. Tickets that you have forwarded to friends will not show a barcode. There will be a message that the ticket has been forwarded with a cancel button in place of the barcode. Will large group tickets with 15 or more tickets and suite rental tickets be listed in the Wallet in the MLB Ballpark app? Yes. See Pirates.com/Groups or Pirates.com/suites for additional group or suite ticket information. When will the tickets I purchase be listed in the Wallet of the MLB Ballpark app? Once Pirates tickets are purchased via an exclusive presale or the general on-sale, your tickets will automatically appear in the Wallet within the Tickets tab of the MLB Ballpark app. Can I still print my Pirates tickets at home? No, to improve security and reduce the risk of ticket fraud, print-at-home tickets in any form are no longer accepted for entry at PNC Park. arrow-up-39035 Back to Top MLB BALLPARK APP - MOBILE TICKET BARCODE What is a Mobile Ticket Barcode? Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan. How do I access the ticket to scan for entry? Tap on an individual ticket from the Tickets tab’s Wallet to pull up the mobile ticket barcode. The Section/Row/Seat and barcode will be displayed along with access to the terms and conditions governing your ticket. Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app? There are several reasons why your barcode may not be available including that the ticket has been forwarded, the ticket had been forwarded to you and has since been canceled or recalled, or you are a group or suite buyer and the ticket status has changed. For mailed tickets, the ticket barcode will not appear until those tickets have been printed and mailed to you. For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it? Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket. During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends? You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet? You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. Can I use Apple Wallet for my Pirates tickets? Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the \"Add to Wallet\" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet. Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets? No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app. Why won't my ticket barcode scan? If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a digital ticket displayed within the MLB Ballpark app, visit the PNC Park Ticket Office. What if I lose connectivity after I've retrieved my tickets? As long as you have previously viewed your tickets, you will still be able to view your tickets in the MLB Ballpark app even with low connectivity. We recommend viewing and loading your tickets prior to arriving at PNC Park or adding to your Apple Wallet to ensure they are accessible regardless of connectivity. If I access my tickets from the MLB Ballpark app, can I still have them printed at a Will Call window? Since tickets retrieved within the MLB Ballpark app will now be considered printed, the tickets will not be available for pickup at Will Call. You should present the ticket displayed in the MLB Ballpark app on your mobile device for entry at the gate. If you are unable to access your ticket, go to a Ticket Office window for assistance on game day. If you have any questions, please contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What do I do if my mobile device's battery dies? Visit the nearest PNC Park Ticket Office window for assistance. arrow-up-39036 Back to Top MLB BALLPARK APP - TICKET FORWARDING What is Ticket Forwarding? The MLB Ballpark app allows you to easily forward tickets to family, friends, colleagues, account partners and others with whom you wish to share your tickets so that they can use their ticket on their personal phone. How do I forward a ticket? From the Tickets tab’s Wallet tap on a game to access a list of your tickets. At the bottom of the list tap \"Forward Ticket\". Select the ticket(s) you wish to forward then choose \"Select From Contacts\", \"Via Email\", or “Share Link’. Selecting \"Forward Ticket\" again prompts you to enter an email address or choose a friend from your Address Book. You can then add the recipient's name (optional) and a message (optional) before tapping \"Send\" to complete the forward. If you wish to send by another method, you can tap \"Share Link\" which will provide you a unique link to share. You can also quickly send tickets to friends you’ve forwarded to recently by tapping on their email! Will the MLB Ballpark app automatically link to the contacts that exist in My Pirates Tickets? No. At this time, \"My Pirates Tickets\" contacts will not automatically link to the MLB Ballpark app. However, the MLB Ballpark app will automatically link to the address book and contacts in your mobile device. How does Forwarding a Ticket via \"Share Link\" work? A unique link, which holds the key to your ticket, will be generated and you can distribute it as you see fit. Please only share this link with one person to whom you are forwarding your ticket. If you share the link with multiple recipients, whomever clicks that link and completes the \"forward accept\" process first will get that ticket. What if I accidentally send the ticket to the wrong email address? You can easily cancel a ticket forward that is in a pending state directly from your list of tickets inside the Wallet. You can then resend the ticket to the correct email address. How will my recipient know I forwarded tickets? Both you and the recipient will receive an email that notifies that the ticket forward has been initiated. The recipient will have a unique link in the email to accept the ticket. If you selected \"Share Link,\" the recipient will receive the notification by whatever method you selected for delivering the link. How do I accept a ticket forward? You must click \"Accept\" from the email invitation you received. If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app on your supported iOS or Android device, you will be prompted to download the app. I do not have a supported iOS or Android device. Can I still accept a ticket forward? Yes, you can accept and receive your tickets in a standard web browser. Once a ticket forward has been accepted, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What if the email address where I received the ticket forward is not the same as the email address associated with my MLB account? The email address at which you received your tickets does not need to match the email address associated with your MLB account, but you will be required to click the link in the email where the ticket was forwarded to. Can I reject a ticket forward? Yes, just click, \"I do not want to accept this ticket\" on the Ticket Accept webpage. This webpage is accessible only from the ticket forward email sent to the recipient. The sender of the ticket forward will be informed that the invitation was rejected and will continue to have access to the ticket in their MLB Ballpark app If I receive a forwarded ticket, can I re-forward that ticket to another recipient? Yes, a ticket can be forwarded again. Each time a ticket is forwarded, the two participants, the sender and the recipient, will receive a notification of this transaction Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward? Yes, the sender can cancel a ticket forward any time before the barcode has been scanned. This can be accomplished from the Wallet tab by selecting an individual ticket and tapping \"Cancel\" or by clicking on the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. Select the specific Forward then tap \"Cancel Forward.\" The recipient of the ticket you forwarded will be notified. Can I cancel or recall a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted? Yes, the original ticket sender can cancel or recall a ticket forward after it has been accepted. The sender and recipient will be notified by email of this action and the ticket will disappear from the recipient's (or anyone they may have forwarded it to) Wallet tab. However, once the ticket has been scanned for entry, the ticket cannot be recalled. Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted and re-sent? Yes, the original ticket owner can cancel the forward for a ticket to a Pirates home game regardless of how many times it has been re-forwarded as long as it has not been scanned for entry yet. The sender and original recipient will be notified by email of this action, and the ticket will disappear from the Wallet Tab and/or My Pirates Tickets account of whomever the ticket had last been forwarded to. Can I forward multiple Pirates tickets to a single account? Yes. Tickets can be forwarded together from the same event or one ticket at a time. Where can I find the status of all Pirates Ticket Forwards? You can navigate to the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. There, you will find all received and sent ticket forwards for your account. What if I never received the Ticket Forward email? If you are expecting to receive a ticket forward but were never notified by email, contact the sender. The sender can cancel the current Ticket Forward then re-send to you by email or share link. If you or the sender are still having difficulties, contact Pirates Fans Services at ticketservices@pirates.com or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. If the person I forward tickets to deletes the email they received to accept the ticket(s) before they click \"Accept,\" what should I do? The ticket owner should cancel their original ticket forward and then re-forward the ticket via the MLB Ballpark app so the recipient receives a new email through which to accept the ticket(s). arrow-up-39037 Back to Top MLB BALLPARK APP - MOBILE TICKET PURCHASE Can I purchase tickets via the MLB Ballpark app? Purchasing seats is now easier than ever in the MLB Ballpark app. Select your game and browse available options from the Buy Tickets tab.

No. At this time, exclusive Season Ticket Holder presale opportunities should be purchased via existing channels. At this time, the MLB Ballpark app cannot accommodate offers to buy additional tickets that are exclusive to Season Ticket Holders. As a Season Ticket Holder, can I pay for my Pirates season tickets via the MLB Ballpark app?

LET'S GO GREEN. DUQUESNE LIGHT POWER HITTERS PROGRAM The Pirates and Duquesne Light teamed up for a unique Power Hitters Program that resulted in 282 trees being planted in Pittsburgh over the course of the 2021 and 2022 season. These trees were planted in underserved communities and targeted historically marginalized neighborhoods because research shows these neighborhoods are more susceptible to \"heat island impacts,\" which can cause impaired water quality, increased energy consumption, and compromised health quality. The neighborhoods are urban areas with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure that absorb the suns heat more than naturally landscaped areas. This causes the neighborhoods to become \"islands\" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas. PNC PARK URBAN GARDEN Pittsburgh Pirates continue to maintain the PNC Park Urban Garden. The Urban Garden uses sustainable practices and provides vegetables and herbs, grown on-site, to be used in Pirates players' favorite healthy dishes prepared by the Pirates Executive Chef Tony Palatucci. Learn More RECYCLING Just like families at home, our Pirates family works hard each season to reduce, reuse and recycle, not just on Earth Day, but every day. In over a decade of sustainability efforts at PNC Park, the Pirates and our partners have recycled... Cardboard 1,825 Tons That’s the equivalent weight of over 200 T-Rex dinos! Fryer Oil 219 Tons This oil is recycled and eventually used as biofuel. Other Recyclables 2,492 Tons Including electronics, toner cartridges, metal, batteries, and more. Plastic 793 Tons Including 1.3 million plastic bottles used by fans each season. Mixed Paper 206 Tons Plus, all paper in the front office is at least 30% post-consumer material. Aluminum 521 Tons Since we have started recycling, we have recycled 521 tons of aluminum. COMPOSTING Food 9,171 Tons Yard Waste 2,037 Tons What is composting, anyway? Composting is organic recycling. Composting allows for the controlled collection of food & organic material, rather than waste-producing methane gas during decomposition in landfills. Direct benefits to soil include increased aeration and structural stability, improved activity of beneficial micro-organisms, faster root development, and ultimately higher yields of agricultural crops. Consider this: If just 25 Pirates fans diverted their food waste to composting for one year, it would equal eliminating the emissions from a 6,000-mile train trip! FOOD DONATIONS Over 29,450 pounds of food was donated between Pirates Executive Chef Tony and Aramark to 412 Food Rescue in 2023. The Pirates sustainability practices successfully divert more than 70-percent of the ballpark waste out of the waste stream each year, equivalent to more than 1,650 tons of materials. Averaged a 70% diversion rate since the inception of the Pirates sustainability efforts. 71% Diversion rate in 2023 Diverted over 1664 tons of materials from landfills in 2023. 7-time winners of the Green Glove Award for the National League Central.

Greg’s association with the Pirates began in 1979, when he interned in the promotions department while attending Point Park University. Following the World Series that year, Brown worked as the clubhouse manager at Pirate City during the Instructional League program in Bradenton, Florida. His 10-year stint in the Bucs front office included work in the Marketing, Public Relations and Broadcasting departments. Greg also served as the team’s public address announcer during the 1987 campaign. In 1988, he was a sports anchor on WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, OH. Prior to joining Pittsburgh’s broadcast team in 1994, Brown spent five seasons (1989-1993) doing play-by-play and color commentary for the Buffalo Bisons of the American Association (now International League) as well as hosting a sportstalk show on WGR Radio. He also worked as a color analyst and a pre and postgame show host for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League for five seasons (1989-93). Brown’s dedication and passion for the Pirates extends to his efforts away from the broadcast booth as he makes numerous off-season appearances in the community, both in the Pittsburgh area and in Bradenton during spring training. Brown is a native of Washington, D.C. He currently resides in Renfrew, PA, with his wife, Kim, and their son. Joe Block Joe Block is in his ninth season of calling Pirates play-by-play action, having joined the TV and radio broadcast teams in 2016. Though having grown up in and outside Detroit, Block considers making his home in Pittsburgh “a dream,” as his grandparents and great-grandparents originally settled in the region, in Wheeling, WV and Byesville, OH.

A variety of improvements will debut throughout the main concourse, including a family-friendly walk-in market, several new beer markets and state-of-the-art technology designed for faster service and ease. SECURE YOUR SEATS TO AN UPCOMING GAME AND CHECK OUT THE NEWEST ADDITIONS! Buy Tickets Learn More 2023 PNC PARK ENHANCEMENTS POPS' PLAZA Fans will notice a new and improved experience in the familiar Pops' Plaza. Additional technology upgrades include self-ordering kiosks allowing fans to place their order at multiple stands in one transaction, thus improving wait times. FAN FAVORITES ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE Continuing through the main concourse, fans can enjoy a selection of fan favorites including several new beer markets, ballpark fare and a redesigned concourse embracing Pittsburgh's history and personality. THE MARKET \"As we continue to enhance PNC Park, our goal is to build upon what makes it so special and provide an exciting and memorable game day experience,\" said Pirates President Travis Williams. \"The improvements to our main concourse come after discussions with our fans. These upgrades to improve entry into the ballpark, flow of the concourse and speed of service are a result of that feedback.\" NEW SCOREBOARD The new scoreboard in left field is more than double the size of the previous display, without taking away from the unrivaled views of Downtown Pittsburgh's skyline. A modern 10-millimeter pixel spacing display, resulting in more than 4K pixels in width, will yield stunningly clear imagery to fans throughout the ballpark. 2022 PNC PARK ENHANCEMENTS FAT HEAD'S BULLPEN BAR Replacing the former gameday security building, the creation of this new gathering space above the center field bullpens includes two rows of drink rails, comfortable seating, televisions and more. Like all of the new spaces, the Fat Head's Bullpen Bar offers a great view of the action on the field, so fans won’t miss a minute of the game while enjoying a craft beer on the Riverwalk. KIDS PLAY AREAS The kids play area in right field has been refreshed and is now expanded to flow along the Riverwalk into the center field area. The expansion features life-sized bobbleheads, a Lucky Climber shaped like a pirate ship, as well as an accessible kid's play bridge inspired by the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge. The evolution of the play area allows families to enjoy the play elements while remaining connected to the action on the field. THE MILLER LITE LANDING Located just above the Center Field fenceline, The Miller Lite Landing offers a fantastic view of the action on the field, as well as the perfect view back to the Roberto Clemente Bridge and downtown cityscape. The new social gathering space features new drink rails, tables and high-top seating creating a relaxed environment for all fans. NEW FOOD CONCEPTS Together with ARAMARK, the Pirates have partnered with local Pittsburgh chefs to create new food concepts and specialty offerings. The new concepts are featured throughout the Riverwalk and in the arcade under the left field bleachers. This includes Cannonball Burger, inspired by Station in Bloomfield, Chicken on the Hill, inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District, and Deli Dogs, inspired by Smallman Street Deli. THE PATIO Located between the Upper and Lower Bleacher seating areas in left field, The Patio is a newly widened and leveled area that extends from the bullpens to the Left Field Rotunda. The expansion of this platform and new furniture allows for a comfortable gathering space overlooking left field. AHN PICNIC PARK Always a fantastic place to host groups, The Picnic Park will now feature upgraded furnishings, enhanced lighting and landscaping, as well as additional access points for greater connection to the new fan enhancements along the Riverwalk. LEFT FIELD LOUNGE The Left Field Lounge exterior is now modified to create one large open platform with a new picket style drink rail that runs the length of the space. These enhancements improve the fan experience by allowing groups to comfortably move about the space, all while allowing for improved sight lines from within the Left Field Lounge. CINDERLANDS CORNER BAR Open to all fans, The Cinderlands Corner Bar is a gathering space below the Left Field Rotunda featuring specialty drinks, local craft beers as well as fan favorite traditional Pittsburgh brews. The area connects the fans in the Cinderlands Corner Bar to the action on the field. The open feel and additional TVs and furniture provide a more fan friendly environment. CELEBRATING HISTORY Retired numbers inspired by the steel design of the nearby three sister bridges and oversized baseballs, celebrating Pittsburgh's rich baseball history, are meticulously positioned throughout the landscaping of the Lower Riverwalk for visitors to enjoy year around.
