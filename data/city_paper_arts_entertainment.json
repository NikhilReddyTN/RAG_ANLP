With nearly a fifth of Pittsburgh claiming Irish roots, it’s no shock the city throws one of the biggest St. Patrick’s Day bashes in the country. For those seeking an authentic Irish experience, a few places serve as Pittsburgh’s cultural anchors. Mullaney’s Harp & Fiddle 2329 Penn Ave., Strip District Arguably the city’s most famous Irish pub, Mullaney’s has been a hub for traditional music, dance, and Guinness-fueled camaraderie for over 30 years. Cork Harbour Pub 181 43rd St., Lawrenceville A newer addition, Cork Harbour has quickly built a reputation as one of the most authentic Irish pubs in the city. With its dark wood interiors, well-poured pints, and regular live music, it’s a solid pick for an old-world atmosphere. The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) Clubs Lawrenceville & Monroeville These private fraternal organizations promote Irish heritage, charity, and community. They host social events, fundraisers, and gatherings that keep the Irish spirit alive in Pittsburgh. Monterey Pub 1227 Monterey St., North Side This cozy neighborhood spot in the Mexican War Streets isn’t strictly Irish, but it has an unmistakable charm that Jim Lamb, president of the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh, tells Pittsburgh City Paper reminds him of home. The warm, inviting tavern makes it a favorite for those looking for a quieter, more intimate atmosphere. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of the Pub on Wheels Pittsburgh's Pub on Wheels The Pub On Wheels And if you’re looking for something different? “My favorite Irish pub in the city is the Pub on Wheels!” Mairin Petrone, Executive Director and President of the Pittsburgh Irish Festival, tells City Paper. “I love it because of its creativity, authenticity, and that you never know where it is going to pop up!” The Irish Design Center 303 S. Craig St., Oakland The center stocks everything from hand-knit Aran sweaters to Celtic jewelry, making it a must-visit for lovers of Irish heritage. The Priory & Grand Hall 614 Pressley St., North Side Without a dedicated Irish cultural center in Pittsburgh, The Priory has become the go-to venue for large Irish events, including concerts, fundraisers, and celebrations. The Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh 1601 Marys St., Sharpsburg A cornerstone of Irish-American relations in Pittsburgh, this nonprofit fosters cultural and business ties between Ireland and Western Pennsylvania. “We’ll host the Donnybrook fights there on Friday, March 14 — Pittsburgh vs. Ireland. Amateur boxing,” Lamb says. click to enlarge Mars Johnson The Little Green Machine Marching Band from South Fayette High School performs in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Downtown Pittsburgh on March 16, 2024. The Perfect Irish-Inspired Day in Pittsburgh Want to celebrate like a true Pittsburgh Irish? Lamb lays out two distinct itineraries — one for Parade Day, one for March 17th itself. March 15th (Parade Day) Start with the St. Patrick’s Parade 5K (register here), then head to Old St. Patrick’s Mass in the Strip. Walk down Liberty Avenue to the parade’s start to meet leaders of the festival and special guests from Ireland. Walk, wave, cheer, and finish the parade strong at the grandstand at the Boulevard of the Allies and Stanwix Street. Post-parade, grab lunch at Café Fifth Avenue, where Guaranteed Irish is playing from noon to 3 p.m. Check out various Irish events across the city and look for a nice plate of Irish stew, ham and cabbage, maybe a whiskey. End the night at Mullaney’s Harp & Fiddle, where the real ceol agus craic happens. Expect another stellar performance by Lamb and Guaranteed Irish. March 17th (St. Patrick’s Day) Attend a catholic mass near you. Catch Lamb performing a solo set at Cork Harbour Pub (1-4 p.m.). Cocktail hour at the Pittsburgh Ireland Fund Gala at Acrisure Stadium. Back to Mullaney’s for a final, whiskey-soaked night of music. And with that, another St. Patrick’s Day in Pittsburgh will be in the books. But as Lamb reminds us, Irish identity here doesn’t begin and end in March. So, as the Irish say, Go mbeirimid beo ar an am seo arís. May we be alive at this time next year. And may we always raise a glass to the past, while keeping an eye on the future.

Recently, another mystical practice has surged in popularity — numerology, or the the study of numbers and the influence they exert over our lives. Though the practice dates back to antiquity, today’s numerology can be used to choose a favorable address or house number, business name, wedding date, or even guide life decisions. Pittsburgh City Paper wondered what insights numerology could give us about Pittsburgh and the numbers nearest and dearest to the region. What does 412 mean? Is it good luck to display Mario Lemieux’s and Franco Harris’ jersey numbers? When a giant bottle of Heinz 57 was bolted to the History Center, did it change the energy of the city? These were some of the questions I took to Colbee McManamon, an intuitive numerologist and owner of Soaring Heart Medicine. McManamon, who is based in Jacksonville, Ore., specializes in life path numerology, which examines birthdates, names, and significant numbers as an “energetic blueprint” that reveals one’s “unique abilities, gifts, and challenges.” She said looking into Pittsburgh’s numerology and life path taught her a lot about the city. “There are these energies that are not part of an outsider’s perspective,” she tells City Paper, noting she expected to see more pointing toward steel and industry. “It made me do a little additional research, because I'm like, ‘Is Pittsburgh an artistic, artsy city?’ … I was able to see beyond the stereotypes and assumptions just by looking at the numbers.” The H Factor Personal numerology readings usually begin with a life path number derived from a birthdate. When looking at any number in numerology, all the digits are added together, then reduced to a single digit, 1-9. (You can use an online calculator for this.) Once reduced, numbers 1 through 9 all carry different meanings. Pittsburgh naturally has to complicate matters by having three birthdates — one as “Pittsborough,” then “Pittsburg” when the city \"lost\" its H, and finally, Pittsburgh in 1911. According to numerology, the spelling of names (which also correspond to numbers) express different energies, meaning Pittsburgh was reborn each time its name changed. McManamon used the first mention of “Pittsborough” by Gen. John Forbes in 1758 as the city’s original birthday, giving it a life path number of five. Five comes up again based on the city’s current spelling (its expression number). click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The former Heinz factory's chimneys While McManamon expected to see fours, associated with hard work and structure, the number five represents dynamism and change. “The five is actually much more expansive,\" McManamon tells CP. “It likes to come up with new solutions, think outside the box. It’s an incredible communicator.” “The main thing with the five, it’s always reinventing itself,” McManamon says. “It’s always coming in and seeing what else is possible. That's the mantra for the five, ‘Well, what else is possible? What else can we do here?’ If this was a four city, it would be like, ‘How can we just work on steel forever?’\" “I just imagine that there’s probably this wild underbelly, this underside of Pittsburgh that maybe the average person doesn't know about, where people are kind of letting loose and live outside the box,” McManamon speculates. “It’s so interesting, because five is actually [the] number of [a] bohemian.” Three is key What might be less surprising to Pittsburghers is the recurrence of the number three, found across our three rivers, The Point, Downtown’s Golden Triangle, and three professional sports teams. Heinz’s number, 57, even reduces to three. During its three name changes, the city had various numbers significant in numerology come up as three. “It was so beautiful looking through names and dates, even jersey numbers [to see] how that three just keeps showing up. It really is the heart of the city, this three energy … There's a really strong life force energy flowing through Pittsburgh,\" McManamon says. In numerology, three represents the energy of a child. While the numbers one and two represent parents (usually essentialized as masculine and feminine), three is “that child [who’s] creative and expressive and knows how to really live in the moment.” “As an energy current, it really represents the arts,” McManamon explains. “What’s born from that is this creative, expressive energy that's full of life, joy, color. It's the most fun energy of all of the numbers to be around.” Pirates legend Roberto Clemente wore number 21 for most of his 18-year career, a number that reduces to three. The recent Clemente documentary revealed the Hall of Famer was a numerology believer, and specifically chose a number that would reduce to three after playing in Three Rivers Stadium and becoming a father of three sons. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of The Clemente Museum Red Enginehouse Truck at the Clemente Museum Pittsburgh athletes are amateur numerologists Clemente is not the only athlete attuned to the city’s numerology. “Athletes [have] kind of a unique experience because they're choosing a number that not only will represent them, but that they're growing into [and] is going to mean something for other people,” McManamon tells CP. Steelers great Franco Harris’ number was 32, which reduces to a five. His own life path number was also five, aligned with both the life path and expression number of Pittsburgh itself. “That’s very representative of the energy that Pittsburgh has, almost like almost an agent of change,” McManamon says of Harris. (The Steelers retired Harris’ jersey number in 2023 — one of only three numbers retired in the team’s history — and it’s currently displayed in Acrisure Stadium.) Penguins captain and hockey icon Mario Lemieux said he choose his jersey number, 66, as a tribute to Wayne Gretzky, 99, both multiples of three. (The number also retired with Lemieux and was raised into the rafters of Mellon Arena.) “Sixty-six also reduces to a three,” McManamon notes, “Which is interesting, because … with these athletes, they[’re] not only exceptional athletes in their sport, but also really connected to the people.” Perhaps no one is more aligned with numerology than current Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, 87, who chose the number based on his birthdate, Aug. 7, 1987. His 2007 contract signing, $8.7 million per year, also reflects his birthdate. \"It seems like a pretty good number. I thought it was kind of unique so I'm happy with that,\" Crosby said at the time. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby “Very cool and interesting use of his number,” McManamon comments. Apparently, Crosby's birthday also gives him a rare and sacred life path number, 22, with McManamon saying, “I’ll be curious to find out, what did he create? What is his legacy?” 90 Neighborhoods As far as Pittsburgh’s life path, McManamon says the city's 90 neighborhoods are an especially powerful expression of it. Nine, as the last number in the cycle, represents completion, as well as “the wise one, the elder, the grandfather or grandmother, because it's been through all of the other experiences.” (We’ll give an additional shout-out here to Pittsburgh’s nine city council members.) “I feel like [90 neighborhoods] represents a complete, whole city, all of the different parts and pieces,” McManamon says. “Without any one of them, it wouldn't be a complete picture. But since we have all of them, we really have … all of the different wisdom and all of the different experiences … If there was even one less neighborhood, it wouldn't be quite as whole.” What can Pittsburgh look forward to in 2025? While numerologists believe the collective is experiencing a “nine year,” or the last year in a nine-year cycle with “lots of endings and completions,” Pittsburgh is only in its second year. “Whatever was initiated last year on a community level, within the city or Pittsburgh as a whole, that really kind of sets the tone,” McManamon says. If it seems quieter around town this year, stick it out. “2026 will be a three year. Next year in Pittsburgh should be very colorful, very vibrant.” Slideshow Come behind the scenes at PPG Paints Arena Click to View 24 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, Colbee McManamon, Soaring Heart Medicine, Roberto Clemente, Sidney Crosby Related Content Don't call him \"Bob\": Clemente captures the legacy of a Pittsburgh Pirates legend By Owen Gabbey Nov 11, 2024 In Pittsburgh, sports are subtly infused with art, if you know where to look for it By Sean Beauford Jun 12, 2024 Pittsburgh famous: A journey through the city’s celebrity murals By Sarah Connor Aug 24, 2022 It's time to retire Ben Roethlisberger from the spotlight By Lisa Cunningham Mar 30, 2022 Latest in Arts + Entertainment Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Punxsutawney Phil fans line up at Wigle Whiskey to meet their \"god\" at Phil-a-Palooza By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 24, 2025 Before Stormy Daniels, there was Canned Peaches By David S.

They invoke various labels and possess a multitude of talents, and in Pittsburgh, they’re everywhere. Whether you’re looking for a tarot reading, potion, or something new to believe in, Pittsburgh has an eclectic handful of shops that offer a range of magical merchandise and spiritual services. Here are a few of our favorites: Hocus Pocus Kali Vee and Paul H. co-own the oldest witch shop in Pittsburgh, so naturally, they have stories to tell. It is nestled in between what is now an Insomnia Cookies and a salon and is unexpectedly cozy, even with burnt orange walls and metal decor. October 13, 2023 will mark over two decades of Hocus Pocus in Pittsburgh. “It’s our 25th anniversary this year, and it’s on Friday the 13th,” Vee tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We opened on Friday the 13th and our address is 113. Yeah, like, our zip code is 15213 and our phone number is 412-622-0113. I was going to name the shop 13.” Vee has been tattooing for 20 years, but her tattoo studio, 13 Needles, only recently reopened after a hiatus due to the pandemic. Her services include everything from ritual tattoos — in which the timing of the tattooing incorporates astrology and moon phases — to reiki and healing oils. “People always come here, and they have serious problems,” Vee says, including everything from serious diseases to difficult relationships. “We have a really good success record with helping. I mean, we do everything; the stuff we hear is crazy.” Often, this work is done for free. Additionally, Vee says, “we have the city's only fully functional Magickal Apothecary,” stocked with 100-plus herbs, roots, resins, and essential oils, plus hand-ground ritual incense. With all that, she says, “we have over a thousand recipes that we can make fresh for clients while they shop.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Dr. Amber Epps of Arts & Crafts shows a set of tarot cards The Menagerie This shop, which specializes in folk magic, has sage green walls and wooden floors that gently invite you in with a soothing, hospitable vibe. They offer free coffee and tea all day long. Walk all the way to the back, and you’ll come upon another shop, The Odd End, full of vintage jewelry, accessories, and taxidermy animals. (Yes, taxidermy animals for sale.) While the place is eclectic, “I would say our theme is community,” owner Jess Kaderka tells CP. “We try to do community-building events, including Stitch, Witch, & Bitch and cycling potlucks. We do divination classes for beginners so they don’t have to worry about being right in their reading.” The store offers spiritual figures from Egyptian, Celtic, Catholic, and other traditions. “We try to be as inclusive as possible with our practices,” Kaderka says. Also available is a library of books and tarot cards which customers can use inside the store for free to practice with their friends or with strangers. The cards are also available during the beginner divination courses for those who don’t own a deck. “There’s a nice thing when you look at metaphysical shops in the Greater Pittsburgh area — that there’s a good number of us, and there’s a lot of variety,” co-owner Patrick Kaderka says. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Dr. Amber Epps, co-owner of Arts & Crafts: Botanica & Occult Shop poses for a portrait inside the store Arts & Crafts: Occult and Botanica Arts & Crafts specializes in products for African traditional religions, but it doesn’t stop there. In fact, the name of the store is a play on words of sorts, alluding to “dark arts” and “witch crafts.” Offering readings, spiritual cleanses, and consultations, owners Amber Epps, Pamela Schon, and Elizabeth Kivowitz — all intuitives in their own way — encourage everyone who comes to Arts & Crafts to make it their own. “Regardless of what you practice, it is still your own path,” Elizabeth tells CP. “We want everyone to feel comfortable.”. Unfortunately, though, time is limited. “We are actually closing at the end of the year. We have been here for seven years in September. We have our own things to focus on. It will leave a gap in the community, but we hope people find understanding,” they say. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kali Vee, owner of Hocus Pocus, holds a human skull. Ceremonial (formerly Juju) and The Moon Studio Ceremonial (formerly Juju) is a metaphysical shop in Point Breeze where you can find tarot decks, potions, crystals, and incense, among other mystical supplies. It is tied with a separate space, The Moon Studio, which focuses on workshops, classes, and community events. “You know, they are both my babies,” Leslie McAllister, owner and founder of Ceremonial, tells CP. \"I am a childless woman, so my children are cats and my business. The Moon Studio has been an extension of what we’ve been doing almost since we’ve opened.” Since 2017, candle, spell, tarot, and other themed gatherings and workshops have taken place both in the Ceremonial store space as well as The Moon Studio, informally called “The Treehouse.” “I believe that the moon is the greatest teacher in terms of understanding that things wax and wane in our lives. You know, we are cyclical and are not meant to be static,” McAllister says. There are both virtual and in-person events, including a week-long Teen Witch Camp hosted by McAllister for teens looking for education about witchcraft. “I really just always identified with the witch archetype,” McAllister says. “The witch archetype to me is — this is just my personal definition — is a person, woman, male, non-binary, which is for everybody. It’s a person who identifies with their inner power.” McAllister found her grandmother’s tarot notebook when she was little, and it sparked a long, complicated journey. “I really kind of focused on tarot and runes growing up and then went through a religious existential crisis when I was 15 to 16. I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’m bad. This is bad.’ I really went through this whole crisis and processed that and then came back out on the other side between the ages of 18 to 21.” McAllister chooses not to use traditional metaphysical or spiritual labels for herself when it comes to practicing divination practices and leading customers through classes and workshops. “I don't even know what to call myself at this point. I try not to call myself psychic or medium because it makes me squeamish. Because I’ve always just been like, ‘No, I’m just going to do what I do.' I don’t really want to put a name on it.\" Editor's note: This story was updated to correct a last name, which was listed incorrectly.

Before his scheduled appearance at Wigle Whiskey, Punxsutawney Phil and his Inner Circle pushed their way through a flurry of fans at the Omni William Penn Hotel, the groundhog’s accommodation of choice when he visits Pittsburgh. “When we walk through the hotel, we draw a huge crowd,” Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We can’t get through without everybody wanting their picture taken with Phil.” City Paper previously looked into Groundhog Day’s history as a hunting festival, midwinter celebration, weather forecast, and climate change bellwether. Naturally at its center is Punxsutawney Phil, the holiday’s eponymous groundhog, who appears as a tiny, remote prophet, and (according to lore) speaks only to Dunkel, his appointed dignitary, in “Groundhogese” to communicate if he’s seen his shadow, and if Pennsylvanians can expect six more weeks of winter. click to enlarge Mars Johnson The Groundhog Club hosts a meet and greet with Punxsutawney Phil at Wigle Whiskey on Jan. 18, 2025. But before his big day on Feb. 2, Phil’s role is less of a deity and more that of an international pop star. To help keep Groundhog Day a free event, Phil leaves the haven of his zoo at Gobbler's Knob — made more difficult this year after he became a dad — for a series of promotions and fundraisers. This year, the groundhog embarked on a mini-tour, visiting the Pennsylvania Farm Show and meeting state representatives, hosting a talent show, promoting Ace Hardware, and making an annual stop in Pittsburgh. On Jan. 18, Wigle Whiskey hosted the sixth annual Phil-a-Palooza, where, for $20, Pittsburghers could get a glimpse of the prognosticating groundhog and take their picture with him. In Phil’s honor, the distillery also released Phil’s Shadow Rye, a version of its flagship rye whiskey aged in Pennsylvania-made maple syrup. Phil merch was for sale, and members of his Inner Circle — the Punxsutawney club responsible for the groundhog’s care, and for continuing the 138-year-old tradition — gave out commemorative Groundhog Day gold coins. An A-list celebrity in Pittsburgh, Phil sells out Wigle every year. 2025 was no different, says Wigle’s marketing director Elise Miranda, who oversaw a line of 175 ticketed guests. (She's also proud to have the Inner Circle on her speed dial.) “Honestly, this is the most fun event we have,” Miranda tells CP. “Everyone loves Phil.” click to enlarge Mars Johnson Tara Panella blows kisses at Punxsutawney Phil on Jan. 18, 2025. Fans were in for a wait, and the line to see Phil stretched out the door into a cold night. Escorted by the Inner Circle, the groundhog arrived in an enclosed habitat, nestled in a bed of straw, with a baggie of veggie snacks in tow. Seeing Phil up close, it's clear he's not your average backyard groundhog, sporting clean, lustrous fur and well-kept muskrat-like claws. Still, he remains \"wild at heart,\" the Inner Circle says, and for the first hour of the event, despite light and climate control, Phil stayed in full hibernation mode, curled up and napping like a cat. But the sleeping groundhog didn’t deter guests, who still snapped selfies next to his plexiglass enclosure. Befitting a pop icon, multiple people tried to kiss Phil, including Tara Panella in full view of her fiancé Joe, a Punxsutawney native. click to enlarge Mars Johnson Dave Gigliotti of the Inner Circle kisses Susie Perrin on the cheek during a meet and greet with Punxsutawney Phil. Susie Perrin, wearing a “Just A Girl Who Loves Phil” shirt and groundhog Mardi Gras beads, says she comes to Phil-a-Palooza every year. As a child, her family stayed at a cabin in Punxsutawney, and returning as an adult, she and friends organize an annual girls' golf outing “and everything we wear is groundhog.” 2025 marks their 18th year, and groundhog-themed pants, hats, and paw gloves are obligatory. Asked if she still gets excited seeing Phil, Perrin says, “Are you kidding? Why would I come? Oh my God, he’s just — how can you not love him?” Part of the allure of Groundhog Day, Perrin and Inner Circle members believe, is the promise of warmer weather arriving soon. “If you live in Pennsylvania, it gets you through the worst part of the winter,” Perrin tells CP. “And then, spring’s right around the corner.” Dunkel and fellow Inner Circle member Rob Gemmell also like to promote Groundhog Day as \"the only world holiday with a destination.\" click to enlarge Mars Johnson The Groundhog Club hosts a meet and greet with Punxsutawney Phil at Wigle Whiskey on Jan. 18, 2025. “You can't go to Christmas,” Dunkel says. “You can't go to Easter or Halloween, but you can go to Groundhog Day.” I suggest that the closest comparison might be Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia that Muslims are required to make. \"Other than religious holidays,\" Dunkel clarifies, though for some, journeying to Punxsutawney and beholding Phil seems to have a religious component. (For Pennsylvanians, a Phil-grimmage?) In Pittsburgh, just as the first wave of spectators begins to thin, Phil stirs. The groundhog starts jumping up to be let out. Apparently, he barks when he's excited and purrs when content. \"The seer of seers!\" Inner Circle member Dave Gigliott (aka Thunder Conductor) announces like a town crier. Phil can be picked up and held like a pet courtesy of a thick hand covering that resembles a falconry glove, and people begin posing for photos with the Inner Circle (\"we are kind of the sideshow to Phil,\" Gemmell says) and the now-loose groundhog. Even outside his enclosure, amidst the crowd and under bright lights, Phil starts getting sleepy. \"This won't last long!\" an Inner Circle member warns. In general, Pittsburgh loves Phil unconditionally, Dunkel says. Being only a 90-minute drive from Punxsutawney, it's a matter of hometown pride. Dunkel has \"a good inkling\" of what Phil's weather prediction will be this year, reminding fans that, unlike in 2024, about 80 percent of the time the groundhog sees his shadow. But even if the Inner Circle \"hear[s] a boo\" on Groundhog Day, the Phil-mania will transcend it, and they still expect a crowd back to meet and toast him next winter.

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo: courtesy of the Library of Congress Frances “Peaches” Browning Stormy Daniels wasn’t the first controversial performer to have a Pittsburgh gig canceled before taking the stage here. Daniels is a former adult film star and outspoken Donald Trump critic. Frances “Peaches” Browning was a Prohibition-era child bride and tabloid sensation. In 1927, Frances was supposed to appear at the Flotilla Club, a Pittsburgh nightclub moored in the Monongahela River at the foot of Wood St. click to enlarge Photo: New York Evening Graphic (public domain) via Wikipedia The New Yorker Evening Graphic sensationalized the \"Peaches and Daddy\" affair in articles and cartoons. Frances Heenan was a 15-year-old school dropout in 1926 when she married Edward Browning, a 51-year-old millionaire real estate investor. Their whirlwind courtship, marriage, and messy breakup took place in the span of seven months. Newspapers around the country reported on the salacious details that included allegations of pedophilia, gold-digging, and a bedroom goose — the honking kind. click to enlarge Photo: The New Yorker published it in a 2015 blog post and attributed the photo to this blog: brandypurdy.blogspot. \"Peaches and Daddy\" posed with the African gander that Edward “Daddy” Browning gave free rein in their home. Edward Browning was known as the “Cinderella Daddy” for his sensational attempts to adopt young girls. Browning’s first wife, Adele, ran away to Paris in 1923 with her dentist. They had adopted two daughters. Edward and Adele each kept custody of one after a highly publicized divorce. In 1925, Browning wanted a companion for the daughter who remained with him. He placed ads in New York newspapers seeking a “pretty, refined girl, about 14 years old.” The response was enthusiastic: would-be donor parents deluged Browning with more than 1,000 offers to allow him to adopt their daughters. He picked one girl, but learned soon after the adoption that she was much older (and more worldly) than her parents had claimed, and the adoption was annulled. click to enlarge Photo: Pittsburgh Press (public domain) via newspapers.com The Flotilla Club was moored in the Monongahela River in 1927 when Frances Heenan was booked to appear there. In 1926, Browning sponsored a high school sorority that held dances in New York City hotels. He met Heenan at one of the dances. The pair began dating and, three weeks later, were engaged. To thwart efforts to prevent the marriage, the couple secretly married in a suburban county north of New York City. Browning gave Heenan a nickname: Peaches. The press dubbed them “Peaches and Daddy,” and eager readers developed an insatiable appetite for the couple’s exploits. Later writers have described the salacious, sensationalized reporting as a low point in journalism’s history. click to enlarge Frances “Peaches” Browning The Peaches-and-Daddy combo quickly soured. Six months after their marriage, Frances packed her things and left their suburban home, and Edward filed for divorce. Unlike Pennsylvania, which has the nation’s oldest divorce law, the best that Browning could do under New York law was secure a legal separation without any requirement to pay alimony. After a New York judge declared that Frances had abandoned Edward and that she wasn’t entitled to any of his wealth, she decamped to Bermuda for some badly needed rest. Uncharacteristically, she declined to speak with reporters about the trip. The nation was grateful. “Peaches Browning refused to be interviewed on her return from Bermuda,” one Indiana newspaper reported. “The public owes her its thanks.” After her vacation,Frances hired a manager and hit the vaudeville circuit. The Pittsburgh gig was one of several booked nationwide in the spring of 1927. The Flotilla Club already had achieved a degree of local infamy by the time that owner, Charles Lazaro, announced that he had booked Frances for a brief gig as a hostess and dancer. The floating nightclub began its life in 1923 as Bongiovanni’s Floating Palace. Bongiovanni, who also owned the Nixon restaurant downtown and a McCandless Township roadhouse, lost everything in a 1925 bankruptcy. Lazaro and his brother John bought the floating nightclub and renamed it the Flotilla Club. Along with the business, the Lazaros also got the regular raids and attempts by the City of Pittsburgh to sink it — the nightclub, not the boat — that had plagued Bongiovanni. Morality-minded reformers pounced in March 1927 after Charles Lazaro announced he had booked Frances. The booking lasted a New York minute — nine hours — and Charles Lazaro didn’t even get a chance to place ads in local newspapers. The day before the news broke in Pittsburgh newspapers that the Flotilla Club wouldn’t be having Frances on its performance menu, the The Pittsburgh Press reported that the Boston city council had blocked an appearance there and that aldermen in Chicago were on the verge of voting to prevent her from appearing there. The Flotilla Club gig would have lasted a week, and Frances would have gotten $5,000. “Peaches is apparently canned,” wrote the The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A bevvy of city officials and civic and religious organization leaders told local reporters that they vigorously opposed any appearance by Frances in Pittsburgh. “It would be detrimental to the morals of the community,” said Saul Levine of the Allegheny County PTA. “I think that Peaches’ scheduled appearance should be stopped,” said St. Patrick’s Church pastor Rev. Dr. James Cox. The news that city governments were putting the kibosh on Frances convinced Charles Lazaro that the negative publicity and potential problems from local law enforcement officers outweighed the potential profits from a “Peaches” appearance. “After giving the matter serious consideration, we decided her appearance here would not benefit the club,” Charles Lazaro told the Pittsburgh Post. Frances threatened to sue the Flotilla Club, but no case was ever filed. Her April 1927 Chicago gig went on as planned. Though the club where she appeared escaped official sanction, Frances herself was arrested on disorderly conduct charges. Newspaper headlines from Oregon to New England preserved Lazaro’s canning of Peaches. Within a couple of weeks, the kerfuffle faded from view. The Harrisburg Patriot newspaper put a lid on the whole canned Peaches episode in an April 1927 editorial. “Barred in Pittsburgh and threatened in Chicago as a night club entertainer, ‘Peaches’ Browning is finding that public sentiment knows where to draw the line on some of the proprieties,” the paper wrote. “The ‘Peaches’ experience ought to be a lesson to others who think that the morbidity of America is beyond the control of the people.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, The Pittsburgh Press, Stormy Daniels, City Winery, The Harrisburg Patriot Related Content Pittsburgh’s top events: March 13-19 By CP Staff Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh’s top events: March 6-12 By CP Staff Mar 5, 2025 Pittsburgh’s top events: Feb. 27-March 5 By CP Staff Feb 26, 2025 ‌Pittsburgh’s top events: Feb. 20-26 By CP Staff Feb 19, 2025 Latest in Arts + Entertainment Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 From three rivers to 412, count the ways numerology is significant to Pittsburgh By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 6, 2025 Punxsutawney Phil fans line up at Wigle Whiskey to meet their \"god\" at Phil-a-Palooza By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 24, 2025 Hot Take: Escape freezing temps at these (literal) Pittsburgh hot spots By Aakanksha Agarwal Jan 20, 2025 More » More Arts + Entertainment All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

Ice on the sidewalks, gray skies for days, and a wind chill that feels personally offensive. But here’s a hot take: instead of bracing for it, why not escape it? You could stay home, buried under a pile of blankets, bingeing mediocre TV while contemplating a move to the Caribbean… or you could embrace the heat like a boss. This city’s got spicy meals, tropical hideaways, and even workshops where you can literally play with fire (safely, of course). Here are a few local hot spots that will warm your heart (and probably your toes). Winter? Never heard of her. Escape the chill at the National Aviary When Pittsburgh feels like an icebox, the National Aviary delivers two tropical getaways to keep you toasty. Step into the Wetlands, a 20,000-square-foot indoor paradise where balmy air greets you, flamingos wade in shallow ponds, and over 30 bird species soar freely through lush greenery. Recently renovated with bird-friendly glass, this habitat mimics a coastal oasis, complete with a towering custom tree for nesting birds and cozy benches perfect for soaking up the tropical vibes. For another warm escape, head to the Tropical Rainforest. A 15-foot waterfall cascades into serene ponds surrounded by cacao and coffee trees, while brightly colored birds flit through the canopy. Don’t miss Wookiee, the Aviary’s resident two-toed sloth, lounging in the treetops like the ultimate tropical ambassador. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of AURA Sauna Studio A person relaxes in one of AURA's infrared saunas. Detox and decompress at Aura Sauna Studio Aura Sauna Studio, Pittsburgh’s only dedicated infrared sauna spot, has six spacious suites ready to detox, de-stress, and de-winter you. Bonus points for the fancy chromotherapy, because who doesn’t want a light show while they sweat out their holiday regrets? Find your escape in the Strip District or South Hills. Book your session and let the cold wonder what happened to you.

Start by choosing your broth: buttery Szechuan spice, tangy tomato, earthy mushroom, or collagen-rich pig’s trotters. Can’t decide? Opt for the two-broth combo and keep everyone happy. Then, let the dunking fun begin. Load up on tender beef, live prawns, Alaskan king crab, and your choice of noodles, from rice to hand-pulled. It’s a meal that’s just as entertaining to prepare as it is satisfying to eat. Pro tip: Bring friends who know how to share — crab legs, especially. click to enlarge Photo: By Nathan J. Shaulis Flameworking class at Pittsburgh Glass Center Blow off the winter blues at Pittsburgh Glass Center For a hands-on antidote to the winter chill, head to the Pittsburgh Glass Center and fire things up with molten glass. Starting Jan. 21 their Hot Glass 1 class ($650, or $585 for members) offers an eight-week journey into the art of gathering, shaping, and blowing molten glass into paperweights, bowls, and cups. No experience? No problem. All you need is a willingness to (safely) play with fire. The class includes expert instruction, teamwork, and two hours of open-studio time each week. Prefer a shorter commitment? The Flameworked Pickles workshop ($105, or $94.50 for members) lets you create quirky glass pickles using a 3,000-degree torch. Choose upcoming dates like Jan 19 or Feb 28, and leave with a one-of-a-kind ornament or pendant — and serious bragging rights. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Great Wolf Lodge Kids getting soaked at Great Wolf Lodge Make a splash at Great Wolf Lodge Sandusky Why shiver in the snow when you can soak in 84-degree bliss? At Great Wolf Lodge Sandusky, winter feels like a distant memory. Dive into water slides, float down a lazy river, or let the kids run wild in a splash zone that’s basically summer in January. Your stay includes free access to the water park, family entertainment, and cozy accommodations ranging from Standard Suites to whimsical Themed Suites. When you’re not swimming, plan a family showdown at MagiQuest or hit the arcade.

With the Pittsburgh Riverhounds organization entering the women’s soccer scene via its brand-new Pittsburgh Riveters SC team, and local grassroots club Steel City FC also choosing to jump to the USL W League after years in the Women’s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and United Women’s Soccer (UWS) leagues, 2025 promises to be a seismic year for soccer and women’s sports in Pittsburgh. For the Riveters, it’s the excitement of the city’s highly successful men’s soccer club placing a women’s team into its structure for the first time. The Riverhounds Development Academy has been producing top-level women’s soccer talent for years, and, as a pro organization with years of top-level experience behind the scenes, the Riveters promise to be a well-resourced, extremely competitive force from their first minute of action — there’s plenty of buzz about impressive season ticket sales and fan engagement already to show for it. Internally, as well, there’s nothing but excitement and high expectations for the upcoming year, nowhere more exemplified than by goalkeeper coach and first assistant coach Reaghan Duval, herself a veteran of the USL W League’s inaugural season in 2022. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Pitt Panthers Women’s Soccer Riveters player Lucia Wells is a North Allegheny and Pitt alum. “I didn’t know much about the league when I was brought on by the Greenville Liberty,” Duval begins. “I think it really helped playing for a team with an established men’s pro side because we were treated as equals, which was fantastic. We played all of our home games over at Legacy Early College, which sat around 3-4,000, and we would get a couple thousand people to show up, which felt packed and was awesome.” “The whole atmosphere behind the training sessions, staff, how they treated you, the locker room facilities, all of that was awesome,” Duval adds. “I definitely think the Riveters are going to match that atmosphere, because we also have that men’s pro side. Sitting down with [Sporting Director] Dan Visser and [Riveters Head Coach] Scott Gibson, they’re trying to match everything we do on the men’s side and treat our girls equally.” With Duval and her pioneering compatriots setting a high standard of play and fan experience from the start, the USL W League has grown rapidly, more than doubling from 44 clubs in its first year to 93 participating in 2025. It’s a growth reflected across women’s sports nationally in recent years, and one the Riveters hope to seize and capitalize on. “I think that speaks to the whole structure within the U.S. and the USL specifically,” Duval says. “Now we don’t only have the NWSL, but we also have the USL Super League, and I think we’re going to continue seeing that growth and development.” “We already have a men’s side and structure to get people to say ‘I want to invest in this, I want to be part of the inaugural season,’” Duval continues. “We don’t have to build a stadium, we don’t have to build new locker rooms or a training facility — we have everything set in place, we have the foundation, and that’s appealing to a lot of already-invested fans.” With a fan-friendly slate of home matches on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, fans will have plenty of chances to experience the Riveters’ high-quality operation over the course of their season. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC Riveters players practice during a Dec. 2024 team combine.

June 27, 7 PM - vs. Steel City FC* For Steel City FC, it’s the continued growth to a new level from the bottom up of one of the city’s longest and most storied soccer clubs. Formed from the merger of the decades-old Pittsburgh Hotspurs and Pittsburgh Arsenal organizations, Steel City has reached new heights in recent years — fielding nationally competitive men’s and women’s teams and reaching the vaunted U.S. Open Cup for the first time in 2024. They’ll now take a progressive step into a larger soccer scene within the United Soccer League’s national footprint across the men’s and women’s games. With a robust, community-centric academy system constantly developing high-quality talent, the Steel City women are aiming to match their elevation to a higher level of competition. A consistently strong force since 2015 in the WPSL and then in the UWS since 2022, the team has already announced the return of a strong roster core from recent years, highlighted by homegrown Steel City FC academy graduate Emily Graeca — returning for her fourth first-team season with the club as captain in 2025. After completing her freshman year locally with the University of Pittsburgh, Graeca is set to continue her collegiate career at James Madison University for her sophomore season. But first, she’s staying home to lead her longtime club into a bright, new era. “I think it’s a great opportunity, especially coming off a spring season, to have a place to come back and get quality training and meaningful games against quality opponents,” Graeca says of the Steel City organization. “It helps us stay in touch with our game. It’s a vital place for us to come back and get reps and continue to prepare for our fall seasons and develop.” “I think moving to a new league and the standard increasing and being more competitive, that’s really great for the club,” Graeca adds of the move to the USL W League. “We’re very fortunate to have a super supportive staff and a professional environment that a lot of kids can look forward to and get a chance to play within. I have played since I was in high school, and it’s been wonderful to keep playing with old teammates after going our separate ways in college.” That continuity is a vital part of Steel City’s organization. A true grassroots club, Steel City operates from a bottom-up approach, placing community, youth development, and a close-knit family feel as the key pillars that make them a successful club. As a key architect of the organization’s strong, nurturing environment, club director, owner, and women’s team head coach Tommo Ovenden is quick to highlight the importance of keeping the game accessible. “While a lot of soccer across the country can feel corporate, we are very grassroots for senior club football,” Ovenden explains of the club’s ideals. “Where there’s some real character and culture to what we’re doing, with our own spin and story. There’s a Picasso quote, ‘Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.’ I think the important thing for us, as we get older, is remembering where we’ve come from and sticking to our roots. It’s what soccer in this country needs.” “We’re built on being club-centric, and we’re thrilled about our league matchups because of how good it’ll be for the local game and getting young girls and families interested in soccer,” he explains. “That higher-level piece is a big driver for the base of our pyramid, so we’re very excited about that. The higher level of play will be amazing from a recruitment standpoint and taking us to the next level.” click to enlarge Photo: Randy Warner Steel City FC huddles before taking on Flower City 1872 on June 16, 2024. Steel City FC Schedule Sat. May 24, 6 PM - @ Erie Sports Center Sat. May 31, 3 PM - vs. Cleveland Force FC Tue. June 3, 6 PM - vs. FC Buffalo Sat. June 7, 6 PM - vs. Erie Sports Center Wed.

June 27, 7 PM - @ Pittsburgh Riveters SC* Sun. June 29, 4 PM - @ FC Buffalo Two high-intensity rivalry matches will bring a thrilling atmosphere most sports struggle to provide. With the Riveters playing at Highmark Stadium in Station Square just south of the Monongahela, and Steel City playing north of the Allegheny at Founders Field, fans get to experience a true cross-river derby for bragging rights across the city. It’s an exciting competitive facet of which both organizations are eager to take advantage. “Having these local rivalries, everyone will grow to love it,” says Ovenden. “I think it’s not only a good thing for business, but for development as well to have these rivalries in the city.” “I think that rivalry games are very important to promote to younger girls,” Graeca says. “Getting to show something locally that’s so exciting and competitive and fun, that’s how you spark love for the game.” “The USLW is in its fourth season, going strong, bringing in 10-20 new teams each year. So not just in Pittsburgh, but all across the country, people want to invest in women’s sports,” Duval explains. “I think the cross-town rivalry is something people are really going to piggyback on and get invested into — picking sides. The rivalry is fun, catchy, [and] it’ll get people to want to come out and see this game and see who comes out on top.” click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC Riveters players practice during a Dec. 2024 team combine. Fans will get two chances to see the sides match up in their divisional schedule. The first will be mid-season on Steel City’s turf at Founders Field on Weds., July 11 at 7 p.m. The second is the highlight of the schedule this season — the Riveters’ season finale at Highmark Stadium on Fri., June 27 at 7 p.m. — which has the opportunity to not only have massive playoff implications on the field, but the chance to be one of the most attended and thrilling games across the entire league. With everything to play for on the field, it remains to be seen who will emerge on top within the city. But one thing is certain: this new experience, and the chance it represents for women’s sports in Pittsburgh, is a win for all of us.

It was announced in April 2024 that the Riverhounds ownership group was in the process of putting a team together and holding a team naming contest. The Riveters moniker emerged the city's clear favorite. Over the years, the soccer scene in Pittsburgh has grown immensely. The Pittsburgh Riverhounds started out playing in various high school venues before moving to their current home at Highmark Stadium, which can currently seat 5,000 people. During their first nine out of 10 years playing in Station Square, there was an average of 2,991 fans that attended the home games. In 2023, the Riverhounds blew that average out of the window, drawing 5,073 spectators per game. They had three games that year alone that ended up drawing 6,000+ people each. 2024 was no small feat either, drawing 5,050 people per game. Dan Visser, sporting director for the Riverhounds, explains the reasons behind adding a women’s club in the area. “I think there’s absolutely a business case for it. If there was not a business case for it, we would not being doing it,” he says. Visser added that there will be six additional home dates that they will be able to sell tickets, providing the opportunity for additional sponsorship. In addition, he explains that this announcement provides another pathway for women, specifically the ones who are in the Riverhounds Academy. “We have a lot of girls who are very successful at the youth level, whether that's U.S. youth national teams, whether that's awards within the ECL or awards within their high school,” he says. Recently, the team announced that they obtained their first commitment for the club in Tessa Dellarose, who currently is attending North Carolina and is a standout member of the soccer team as a defender. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of University of North Carolina Athletics Tessa Dellarose is the Riveters' first committed player. “In terms of specific profiles, I think we are going after the studs,” he says. “You bring a Tessa Dellarose on, who has checked every box in terms of everything … certainly checks every box in terms of her on the field play, her work rate, and her attitude,” he says. “For her to be dominating fitness tests at the University of North Carolina is no small feat. She’s [also] hyper invested in the city of Pittsburgh,” he says. Visser says the organization has undertaken a continual process of team building. “We’re having conversations with other girls as well…We can be highly selective and are still pretty early in the process,” he says. With a new squad comes a new coach. Last month, the Riverhounds brass announced that Scott Gibson would become the inaugural head coach for the Riveters. Gibson, an England native, played college soccer at Duquesne University and was a member of the Riverhounds as a player from 2008-2009. Recently, he has spent significant time in the Riverhounds Academy serving as director working with up and coming female soccer players. “I have had a good touch print on the female side for the last ten years or so,” he says. “I think it was a natural step for me, knowing the marketplace and having worked with many female athletes. It’s always been the goal of the Riverhounds organization to field a women’s team too,” he says. After meeting with Visser, the Riverhounds offered him the role. “They came to me with an offer and I says it was just too good to turn down,” he says. click to enlarge Photo: Lindsay Baase/Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC Scott Gibson coaches the Riverhounds Academy girls at the Elite Clubs National League Playoffs June 2023 in Del Mar, Calif. While he will have the responsibilities of being a head coach, Gibson will still be working in the Academy. He talked about the overall excitement of a new team sharing the same space. “It’s been exciting. I mean, Tessa [Dellarose] was in the Riverhounds Academy herself. I coached Tessa as well as many of our staff when she was probably 14 years-old. She is the type of person we want to build this around,” he says. While optimistic about what lies ahead, Gibson knows that there is work to be done in the present. He says that there is a massive “responsibility” to get this done properly. “There has been a big buzz from this and that has certainly been rewarding,” he says. “We’re in year one, so there’ll be ups and downs, but I’ll put everything into it and our staff will put everything into it to make it an amazing experience for the players because they are the most important piece of this,” he says. Overall, Visser says that fans of the Riverhounds have a lot to look forward to with the introduction of the Riveters. “I think they ought to look forward to success on the field. Beyond that, we’ve got a very large academy now with 1,100 players and half of which are girls,” he says. “There is a huge academy connection, having our academy director [Scott] as the head coach. It’s super exciting for not just the fans, but also the young girls in our community.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Sports, Pittsburgh Riveters SC, Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, Dan Visser, Tessa Dellarose, Scott Gibson, USL W-League, Highmark Stadium Related Content Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 ‌Pittsburgh’s top events: Sept. 19-25 By CP Staff Sep 18, 2024 When soccer’s away, live music will play (again) at Highmark Stadium By Amanda Waltz Jul 31, 2024 Pittsburgh’s top events: May 16-22 By CP Staff May 15, 2024 Latest in Sports Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

Grubba said the four finalists were winnowed from more than 1,000 entries that included everything from \"Boaty McBoatface\"-style pranks to names of defunct teams from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s in addition to numerous creative suggestions. \"Actually, Riverhounds was one of the top four names people suggested,\" Grubbs says. \"But ... we'd already determined we want to go with it with a distinct brand for them.\" Voting in this final round will be limited to one vote per fan. Grubba expects the team's name to be announced within approximately the next four weeks. \"After that comes design of jerseys design of secondary logos, wordmarks, you know, more enhanced things,\" he says. The team has some preliminary design ideas ready for each of the four club identities so it can hit the ground running between the end of voting and the W League team's planned launch in 2025. The W League is a preprofessional league that began play in 2022. It sits below the USL Super League in the U.S. women's soccer pyramid and functions as an incubator for college and even some high-school breakout talent. Grubba says the W League strengthens the national pipeline for women's soccer, noting that \"many players from the League have gone on to end up getting drafted in NWSL [or] gone overseas to play in Europe.\" The league's shorter season typically runs from May to July. The addition of a W League team locally also means more opportunities for Pittsburgh-area talent. The Riverhounds recently announced plans for a multi-field soccer complex in North Huntingdon that would greatly expand the team youth academy's footprint. The W League team would mean girls building their skills at the academy have an additional option when they age out. \"Right now, after the age of 19, girls just graduate out, go to colleges, or go their separate ways,\" Grubba says. \"And so this bridges that gap from that to the professional level.\" While the Riverhounds themselves have scuffled this season, going winless over their last nine fixtures, the team has nonetheless deepened its talent pool and fostered a welcoming fan culture at Highmark Stadium for soccer fans across the region and beyond. Grubba says the emergent W League deepens that commitment at a time when interest in women's soccer is sky high. \"This vote is the last chance for fans [to name the team],\" he says. \"We want to see many people get involved.\" Potential Confluence, Renegades, Riveters, or Strikers fans have until Fri., July 19 to do so on the Riverhounds website.

I also saw The Pixies, Ben Folds, Rufus Wainwright, and Guster, though they all managed to remain conscious. This was when the riverfront entertainment district had an outdoor music venue that, through the years, went by many names, including I.C. Light Amphitheatre, Chevrolet Amphitheatre, and, during my concert-going days around 2011, Trib Total Media Amphitheatre. Since then, the location has undergone a major overhaul, transforming into Highmark Stadium, a sports arena where, since 2013, soccer fans have cheered on the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. But music will soon return to the site on a more regular basis, with a standalone concert taking place on Sat., Aug. 3, the first since the pandemic put a hold on large events. The concert, a country music showcase featuring Grammy Award nominee David Nail, marks the latest step to re-establish Highmark Stadium as an outdoor concert venue that, according to one description, “fills the gap, size-wise” between other area outdoor concert venues like Stage AE and Pittsburgh’s stadiums. Jeff Garner, who has served as the Riverhounds’ president for two years, tells Pittsburgh City Paper he was not present for the stadium’s live music glory days, but he knows it attracted plenty of fans looking to see big name acts. “I've heard all kinds of stories of like, ‘I saw Aerosmith here, I saw so and so here,’ whatever band they remember,” says Garner. “But it was such a well-known music venue at that time … And so, usually, when we start to talk about, hey, we'd like to do more concerts, they get very excited about the possibility of being able to come back down here.” While the stadium has recently played host to local music events, including the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival and the Highmark Blues and Heritage Festival, Garner says they have a new vision that starts with providing affordable, accessible, all-ages entertainment. “It's something though that is much more of a focus for us as we move forward, to bring other events besides just the Riverhounds into this venue,” Garner explains, adding that, for now, they are “looking for artists that can play to the whole family.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Highmark Stadium On Sept. 22, the stadium will also host the Family Beats & Bounce Festival, an event featuring live local and regional cover bands and a kid-friendly “inflatable village” full of bounce houses, obstacle courses, games, and more. Ideally, if all goes well, Garner says they foresee hosting four to six concerts in 2025 and eight to 10 concerts a year moving forward. While the upcoming concerts will have a more intimate feel, welcoming crowds numbering up to 5,000, Garner says they plan on fully utilizing the venue’s 10,000-person capacity for future music events. He says they are also working on expanding the stadium’s capacity to 15,000 seats, which would translate to 20,000-25,000 guests for concerts, The focus on music also allows Garner and his team to make use of the stadium during the 348 days when it’s not hosting a Riverhounds home game. The focus on music, however, does not mean that soccer will be neglected, as, according to Garner, Highmark Stadium will welcome women’s soccer matches beginning in May 2025. He predicts that, over the next 10 years, which will see the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup, local and national interest in soccer will continue to grow. Even as the love for soccer has, according to Garner, “exploded” in the U.S., especially among a younger demographic, he observes that Highmark Stadium soccer crowds are often there for more than the matches. “For the diehard soccer fans, there's a really great soccer product here,” says Garner. “But probably 80% of our crowd, I don't think they know the score when they leave the stadium. And they clap when they're supposed to clap and they yell and get excited when we score a goal. But they're not necessarily here just for the game. They're here for a fun night out with family or friends.” Garner chalks this up to the many assets that Highmark Stadium provides, including low ticket prices, access to ample event parking, walkability from Downtown, on-site food and beverage options, and scenic views of the Monongahela River and city skyline. “It's just a beautiful place to spend a summer or fall evening and have a few beverages with your friends and listen to some live music,” says Garner. He believes that Highmark Stadium could also take the hassle and high costs out of seeing notable touring musicians, as well as local acts, in Pittsburgh. “Now you’re going to have an alternative for similar types of acts in a setting like this with much more accessibility, and [we’re] trying to make sure prices remain affordable,” says Garner. “We feel like we have a pretty good shot at doing something special here.” click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Country in the City Concert info Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Music, Meat Loaf, The Pixies, Ben Folds, Rufus Wainwright, Guster, Highmark Stadium, Pittsburgh Riverhounds, David Nail, Stage AE, Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival, Highmark Blues and Heritage Festival, Family Beats & Bounce Festival Related Content Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh’s top events: Feb. 27-March 5 By CP Staff Feb 26, 2025 Pittsburgh’s top events: Jan. 30-Feb. 5 By CP Staff Jan 29, 2025 ‌This‌ ‌winter’s‌ ‌must-see‌ ‌arts‌ ‌and‌ ‌cultural‌ productions By CP Staff Jan 15, 2025 Latest in Music 156/silence's atmospheric metalcore is reverberating far beyond Pittsburgh By Eli Enis Mar 11, 2025 Shaggy on 25 years of “It Wasn’t Me,” his BFF Sting, reggae's roots, and the Pittsburgh show that ties it all together By Kate Oczypok Feb 21, 2025 Pittsburgh’s “incredible noise machines” are changing local rock By Eli Enis Feb 5, 2025 Tim Heidecker talks Bob Dylan, songwriting, and Pittsburgh ahead of Spirit show By Matt Petras Feb 5, 2025 More » More Music All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images The Wienermobile rolls through the Strip By Mars Johnson Mar 14, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

There comes a time in every metalcore band’s career when they must decide: clean vocals or no clean vocals? For bands operating in a genre premised on harsh screams and brutal breakdowns, bringing more conventional rock melodies into the fold can either backfire horribly or pay enormous dividends. Thankfully, for Pittsburgh’s 156/silence, the latter has been the case. Since their fifth album, People Watching, dropped in September of 2024, the quintet have sneakily become one of the biggest active bands to spawn from Pittsburgh’s heavy music scene. In January, they sold out the big room of New Kensington hardcore hub Preserving, playing for hundreds of ecstatic headbangers who sang and swung along to the moody, menacing bangers that encompass People Watching. For reference, their previous hometown release show back in 2021 went down at the quaint DIY habitat Mr. Roboto Project — meaning their audience has more than doubled in just a few year’s time. And they're not only beloved in Pittsburgh. Roughly half of the dates on 156/silence’s nationwide winter tour were sold out, a statistic that still boggles singer Jack Murray’s mind given how long the band’s been grinding to get to this point. “The first headline tour I did with 156/silence was in 2018, and we played an entire tour for nobody,” Murray tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We played shows for literally two people, one person.” For years, 156/silence were local misfits on the precipice of breaking out nationally but never quite getting there. They’ve toured consistently, including with big-name acts like The Acacia Strain and Unearth, and have been signed to the heavyweight metalcore label SharpTone Records (August Burns Red, Loathe) since 2020. click to enlarge Photo: Steve Buvalla 156/silence on tour in Hartford, Conn. However, the band, which started in 2015 with a different singer and a much different sound, never managed to scale beyond in-the-know metalcore heads with the skronky, vein-popping blitzes that encompassed People Watching’s predecessor LPs (2018’s Undercover Scumbag, 2020’s Irrational Pull, 2022’s Narrative). Heading into their 10th year as a band, 156/silence felt they needed to take a big swing, and with People Watching, they refurbished their sound with sleek choruses, upgraded production and songwriting motifs that rely as much on atmosphere as they do acidic heaviness. “There were definitely talks of it being kind of a make-or-break record,” Murray recalls, thinking about how much energy he and his bandmates invested in 156/silence in the years prior. “Because there’s so much work [that goes into] touring and sacrifices we have to make. We all have lives, we all have jobs, and it definitely takes a toll on your brain.” Both in scale and sound, this current iteration of 156/silence is nearly unrecognizable from where they began. Original vocalist Mike Ernst named the band after a measure count he read on a piece of sheet music, and that artsy connotation was more in line with the initial idea for the band: to blend the poetic post-hardcore of La Dispute and Being As an Ocean with the frenetic metalcore of The Chariot. After their sole 2016 LP with that oddball sonic mixture, Ernst departed the band, and guitarist Jim Howell became 156/silence’s primary songwriter, pulling the group in a heavier, more overtly hardcore direction with their sophomore effort, Undercover Scumbag. That was the first record to feature the frenetic shrieks of Murray, an ambitious young vocalist whose old band opened a 156/silence gig that was so impressive that Murray began fantasizing about switching teams. “Every other band played on the stage, but [156/silence] played on the floor with the crowd,” Murray remembers. “I was like, ‘wow, I want to be in that band.’” After Undercover Scumbag and their equally heavy follow-up, Irrational Pull, 156/silence had some minor buzz outside Pittsburgh, but within the city limits, they had yet to find their place in the fickle hardcore landscape. “The Pittsburgh scene is weird; it always has been,” Murray says. “Until Preserving came out, the local scene was just cliquey. You’re either cool or you’re not, and for so long we weren’t cool.” Nevertheless, the band kept pushing, and with the inflated popularity of hardcore and its associated sub-genres coming out of COVID lockdown, there was more space in the zeitgeist for a band like 156/silence, who began organically pulling in elements of nu-metal on 2022’s Narrative, finding common ground with other respected contemporaries like Boston’s Vein and Nashville’s Orthodox. click to enlarge Photo: Steve Buvalla 156/silence in Anaheim, Calif. For People Watching, Murray and his bandmates knew they wanted to take things a step further with full-bore rock parts, a risky maneuver that could’ve isolated their hardcore loyalists and left them scrambling if it didn’t cross over into the much more hook-friendly metalcore world. Murray remembers telling Howell he hoped the record would be 156/silence’s Sempiternal, referring to Bring Me the Horizon’s craftily catchy 2013 breakthrough that pushed metalcore into a new era and launched the band to untold heights. Again, 156/silence were fully aware of how polarizing People Watching’s pivot might be, all the way down to its terrifyingly uncanny cover art of a demented smiling man that's inspired by Aphex Twin’s iconic grinning visage, and has taken on a meme-driven life of its own throughout the internet, appearing in unrelated YouTube videos and brain rot memes. “People either love it or absolutely hate it,” Murray says of the cover. “Like, ‘I don’t want to look at that, I’m not buying that t-shirt.’” <a href=\"https://sharptonerecords.bandcamp.com/album/people-watching\">People Watching by 156/Silence</a> Musically, People Watching may have turned off some fans with gnarlier proclivities (though there’s still plenty of heavy within its tracklist), but the tepid shrugs are far outweighed by the tens of thousands of diehard fans who’ve joined the 156/silence fold since its arrival. Although Murray calls it “boring numbers stuff,” he’s proud of how many monthly listeners the group now have on Spotify, and even more grateful that that digital metric translated into real-life fandom on the road. Their aforementioned co-headlining tour with Illinois metalcore crew VCTMS was a rousing success, especially in far-away cities where 156/silence used to expect no more than a handful of heads at their gigs. “We didn’t know if 30 or 40 people would even come to some of these shows,” Murray says. “And hundreds of people were coming out in Lubbock, Texas on a fucking Monday or Tuesday. That was unheard of before.” 156/silence have come this far, and they're not slowing down for the rest of 2025. More touring is on the books for the remainder of the year, including a spring trek opening for metalcore genre kingpins Silent Planet and Invent Animate, which will put the band in front of some of their biggest audiences yet. The band have serious wind in their sails right now and some major opportunities ahead of them — but don’t think they’ve gone full rockstar. Murray’s reason for pursuing the band remains the same as it always has been (“I just like to make music and perform breakdowns with my buddies”), and if things keep going in 156/silence’s favor, he might even be able to quit his dayjob and commit to mosh music full time. “I’d love to not pour concrete anymore,” Murray deadpans with a grin. “That's what I would really, really, really love.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Music, 156/silence, Preserving Underground, Roboto Project Related Content ‌Pittsburgh’s top events: Feb. 20-26 By CP Staff Feb 19, 2025 Pittsburgh's top events: Oct. 31- Nov. 6 By CP Staff Oct 30, 2024 Pittsburgh’s top events: Oct. 24-30 By CP Staff Oct 23, 2024 ‌Pittsburgh’s top events: Sept. 19-25 By CP Staff Sep 18, 2024 Latest in Music Shaggy on 25 years of “It Wasn’t Me,” his BFF Sting, reggae's roots, and the Pittsburgh show that ties it all together By Kate Oczypok Feb 21, 2025 Pittsburgh’s “incredible noise machines” are changing local rock By Eli Enis Feb 5, 2025 Tim Heidecker talks Bob Dylan, songwriting, and Pittsburgh ahead of Spirit show By Matt Petras Feb 5, 2025 Remembering the Pittsburgh Hard Rock Cafe as it prepares to close By Amanda Waltz Jan 31, 2025 More » More Music All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

Two-and-a-half decades later, there are TikToks with Gen Zs dancing to the song, and another one of Shaggy’s hits, 1995’s “Boombastic,” was recently featured in a Fiat ad. Now, Shaggy is on a mission to present a history of reggae that will bring him to the Heinz Hall stage to perform with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. He first got the idea to tell this story with his music through an unlikely friendship with Sting (more on that later). After watching Sting’s 2023 performance at the same Pittsburgh venue, Shaggy was moved, and after speaking with Sting, was inspired to do his own show. “When Sting did it, he did it with really just his catalog, but I wanted to use the platform to tell a story of Jamaican music,” Shaggy says. “Jamaican culture has been so influential in popular culture — look at everything Grace Jones did, or Lady Gaga or Doja Cat, or the biggest rock band in the world, U2, which was founded by Chris Blackwell, had some Jamaican reggae influence.” Even Sting’s band, The Police, has reggae and Calypso influences. Shaggy is planning to showcase a reggae anthology where he tells the backstory of how influential the music has been on popular culture. He also plans to tie it into his catalog of music, and the stories behind some of his songs, and how they’ve become a part of pop culture — like “It Wasn’t Me,” which has transcended multiple decades. “There’s been a lot of negativities associated with reggae over the years,” he says. “A lot look at the music and culture as a homophobic culture with homophobic music, or it’s the music of guns and violence, or the music of weed.” Shaggy encourages those who are interested to “not judge a book by its cover.” “A lot of things reggae is involved in are incredibly positive, and that is what I try to do, shed the light on their importance,” he says. “Reggae and dance hall music is a music of love, a music of fun, and a music of celebration; it’s also a music of protest — I want to bring audiences on that roller coaster of different things.” In addition to his show in Pittsburgh on February 26, Shaggy is releasing a song with Sting later this month. Calling Sting the “bro he didn’t know he needed,” the two first met in Antwerp, Belgium in 2004 when Sting called him to the stage to perform “Roxanne” with him. Shaggy didn’t see Sting for years after until they had dressing rooms next to each other at an awards show. They spoke again a while later after Shaggy’s A&R (artists and repertoire) representative played Shaggy’s song “Don’t Make Me Wait” for Sting. Sting loved it, and the duo “ended up in the studio having more laughs than work,” Shaggy says. The two collaborated on the Grammy winning 2018 album 44/876, touring the world together. Sting’s wife, Trudy Styler, and Shaggy got along well, as did Shaggy’s wife, Rebecca, and Trudy. Their families vacation together and now, Sting and Shaggy speak every week, sometimes multiple times per week. As far as his time in Pittsburgh, Shaggy is looking forward to having Primanti’s version of a cheesesteak. Mr. Symphonic: Shaggy with the PSO. Weds., Feb. 26, 7:30 p.m. $35-59.

Shoegaze, the fuzzy, ethereal rock genre typified by U.K. pioneers My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, has a new home base: the Keystone State. Nothing, Blue Smiley, and They Are Gutting a Body of Water are three of the 21st century’s most influential shoegaze acts, and all of them emerged from Philly’s fertile DIY landscape. When feeble little horse, the biggest shoegaze band in Pittsburgh history, broke out nationally in late 2022, their whimsically scuzzy sound was frequently compared to the lo-fi shoegaze idiom percolating across Pennsylvania. For a while, feeble little horse were the only Pittsburgh band tapping into that contemporary shoegaze vein — this is no longer the case. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Pro Video performs at Haven on Jan. 25, 2025. click to enlarge click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Haven Going into the decade’s second half, Pittsburgh now has its own impressive roster of up-and-coming bands operating within this distinctly modern framework of Americanized shoegaze. Gina Gory, James Castle, and Forty Winks are three young groups with a mutual love for fuzz-loaded guitar texture, oppressive volume, and vocals that favor atmosphere over articulation. Their millennial scene elders, Gaadge and Ex-Pilots, have released equally worthwhile, albeit more traditional, shoegaze products in the 2020s. The music those aforementioned Gen-Z ’gazers are making, however, feels like a homegrown response to feeble little horse, specifically. A breed of shoegaze that's brittle and jittery, hooky and shrill, and visually expressed through a post-ironic pastiche of 2000s internet iconography (digital point-and-shoot camera photos, crude photoshop collages, ostentatious hip-hop fonts). “It’s a real blessing to be playing in the same scene as those two bands,” Gina Gory, guitarist-vocalist Veronika Cloutier says of Forty Winks and James Castle. “They are incredible noise machines in their own right.” And a scene it is. Gina Gory opened for feeble little horse at their Girl With Fish release show in 2023. “That entire experience was incredibly affirming,” Cloutier enthuses. Last year, Forty Winks’ first-ever gig was with Gina Gory, and James Castle shared the stage with both groups in 2024, including tapping Forty Winks to open their EP release show last November. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Michi Tapes Gina Gory plays a show at Gooskis on Aug. 10, 2024 “We love seeing them and playing alongside them,” James Castle singer-guitarist, Joel Warchol, says of their peer bands. “They help strengthen the idea that there’s a formidable noise rock-slash-pop scene that has been brewing in Pittsburgh for a little while now.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Michi Tapes Gina Gory Notice how he didn’t say “shoegaze.” The definition of the genre has evolved dramatically since it was first used in the early 1990s to half-jokingly tag an emerging English noise-pop scene of downward pedalboard viewers who were coming up in the wake of My Bloody Valentine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Cocteau Twins. Shoegaze outposts soon popped up throughout the world (especially in America), and in the decades that followed, the initial meaning of shoegaze has been stretched and molded to accommodate new sonic developments that still feel congruent with shoegaze’s archetypal philosophy: guitars bathed in distortion and reverb, buried vocals, and mosaic songwriting that conveys feelings instead of telling stories. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of James Castle James Castle James Castle isn't opposed to being lumped under the shoegaze umbrella because the term, in its current, liberally-applied incarnation, doesn’t feel “constrictive.” “There are so many great bands today that are labeled as ‘shoegaze’ that vary so widely in sound and influence,” Warchol says. “It’s hard to be mad about the distinction if it does come our way.” Gina Gory and Forty Winks, however, don’t feel like they fit as snugly into that taxonomy. “Well, we aren’t ever gazing at our shoes. We wouldn’t be a very good shoegaze band,” quips Forty Winks bassist-vocalist Conner McGee. “But seriously, it's just a popular term right now. We aren’t contrarian, but we really don’t make true shoegaze music. We have our influences, but it isn’t a label we identify with.” click to enlarge Photo: Riley Alice Kirk Forty Winks After forming in early 2024 under the name Whatever, the quartet remodeled as Forty Winks last fall and dropped their debut song, aptly titled “noise,” onto YouTube in September. The track erupts with sandblasted chords, chipper drums, and a vocal performance from guitarist-singer Cilia Catello that alternately recalls the twangy melodies of Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman and the sassy talk-sings of Feeble Little Horse’s Lydia Slocum. Their second single, “spurs,” their first for Pittsburgh DIY powerhouse Crafted Sounds (feeble little horse, Merce Lemon, Gaadge), features clangy riffs that squeal mournfully in the style of They Are Gutting a Body of Water, and bruised-heart vocals that brood beneath the scrum. McGee avoids claiming influence from any particular shoegaze band, but it’s evident in the way “noise” and “spurs” assemble their individual parts into gushing waterfalls of abrasive pop-rock that Forty Winks are fluent in shoegaze’s sonic lexicon. click to enlarge Photo: Riley Alice Kirk Forty Winks If anything, it’s Forty Winks’ lead guitar work that provides the biggest challenge to their shoegaze membership. Chief shredder Kyuhwan “Q” Hwang has a virtuosic playstyle that's reminiscent of 2010s lo-fi prog-pop group Crying. With Forty Winks, Hwang’s funneling guitar solos and hammer-on riffs into a genre where that degree of quickfire technicality is historically absent. James Castle also shred, but more in the way J. Mascis did on Dinosaur Jr.’s proto-shoegaze masterpiece, You’re Living All Over Me. Their debut EP, spenser, released in November 2024, tries on several noisy hats for size (Dino J. rippers, Deftones-y headbangers, Blue Smiley-ish churners) without cohering into a singular identity. Live, James Castle is one of Pittsburgh’s most ferociously engrossing acts, as drummer Ed Haberle bangs his kit like the city’s power grid depends on it, and his bandmates emit enough distorted racket to drown out a fire engine. “I think now we’re narrowing down that pool and fine-tuning the style we want for our current state,” Warchol says of James Castle’s next phase. “Experimenting with more electronic noise like on the spenser EP, but with even gentler moments and equally harsher ones. Aiming to become more stylistically consistent, but dynamically varied.” For Gina Gory, it’s a lack of dynamic variation that makes their sound so enamoring. The trio — guitarist Cloutier, bassist Connaely Martin, and synthesist Dylan Henricksen, all of whom sing and are kept in time by a drum machine — are the most established of the three groups, having been steadily releasing music since the summer of 2023. Their debut LP, October 2024’s Died Laughing, is a slow-drip of sticky, syrupy noise-pop that wearily pulses like a poisoned insect twitching its legs during its final hours. Cloutier checks everyone from Duster to Sonic Youth as being musical reference points, and also emphasizes Gina Gory’s particular affinity for 1990s American shoegazers Swirlies, Lilys, and Astrobrite, groups who are noisier and more gnarled than the dulcet ambience of Slowdive, and who are having an acute influence on the modern milieu Feeble Little Horse has been spearheading “There is an overall reverence for a sonically agitated hook when it comes to the impact feeble little horse has had on us,” Cloutier says of their hometown heroes. As for a musical dialogue between Gina Gory, Forty Winks and James Castle, Cloutier recognizes it’s fomenting, even if it’s still in a sapling stage. “The infusion of influence exists, absolutely,” Cloutier says. “But to pinpoint exactly where that exists is hard to say considering how fetal we all are.” That's the greatest part about Pittsburgh’s nascent shoegaze wave: the best is still in front of us. All three bands confirm that new music is in the works, and they expect to gig frequently in the coming year. Stock up on earplugs now while you still have time.

Merce Lemon’s new album, Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild, is teeming with naturalistic imagery: birdseed and blossoms, backyards and butterflies, crashing waves and muddy puddles, enough crows to “make a city of this ghost town.” The music sounds like fresh air is flowing between her guitar strings. During the quiet parts, you almost expect to hear a squirrel chittering in the background. The song tempos are unhurried like the freedom of hiking without cell service, and the hint of guitar twang suggests that, despite Lemon’s urban roots, she spends enough time outdoors to earn herself a proper farmer’s tan. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Merce Lemon poses for a portrait at home. If you tried to envision the home where this earthy lyricist and cozy singer resided, it would look exactly like the one Pittsburgh City Paper visits in Pittsburgh. Her front porch is overflowing with greenery, and around back is a nicely preened garden, leafy and lush. When I enter Lemon’s kitchen, she’s standing calmly at the counter spreading avocado on warm toast. At this point, the 27-year-old already had a full day’s work at her landscaping job and then came home to spend another couple hours in the garden. “It’s kind of contagious,” she says with a giggle. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A ceramic lemon seen in Merce Lemon's kitchen. Lemon wasn’t always this connected with nature. Her first two albums, 2017’s Ideal for a Light Flow With Your Body and 2020’s Moonth, evoked the cramped comforts of a dusty attic. Her introverted twee-pop songs, alternately silly and sad, were a Pittsburgher’s response to the bedroom-pop renaissance that artists like Frankie Cosmos and Florist were leading in New York City. But since those bodies of work, Lemon’s life has changed dramatically. Between working with soil for three years and spending one COVID-era summer sleeping outside almost every night, her love of nature has deepened. Meanwhile, her artistic confidence has strengthened; her voice is more powerful, her lyrics more vivid. Her band, comprising entirely new members since Moonth, have ignited her songs with a mesmerizing chemistry. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Merce Lemon poses for a portrait at home. Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild, due out Sept. 27 via Darling Recordings, inhabits the nexus between the spellbinding folk-rock of Big Thief and the rip-roaring country-rock of Crazy Horse. It’s a full-bodied triumph that positions Lemon, long one of the city’s burgeoning indie-rock talents, for a legitimate breakthrough beyond the 412. It’s such a resounding statement of purpose that it’s shocking to think that, just a few years back, Lemon was questioning her own identity as a songwriter. “The thing about music is like, OK, if this doesn't work out, who am I?” At the very least, she’ll always be Merce Lemon. In 10th grade, her mom encouraged her to legally change her last name to Lemon, just because Merce liked the ring of it. Her early childhood was similarly unusual. Growing up in South Oakland, the singer-songwriter was part of an “open and artistic” community of family friends who spent almost all of their time together. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Merce Lemon poses with Tiger Lilies From ages two to seven, Lemon attended a Spanish language immersion preschool in a backyard in Wilkinsburg. Her mother is a professional letterpress printer, and her grandmother was a visual artist, while her dad, who fans might recognize from his years-long stint in Lemon’s live band, is a film archivist whose collection once filled every crevice in their home. “Crafting was perpetual,” Lemon says of her free-thinking upbringing. “We were rarely clothed — but it wasn’t a cult.” Music was everywhere. Her parents, both musicians themselves, also hosted touring artists at their home. One frequent guest was Kimya Dawson of 2000s twee icons The Moldy Peaches, who Lemon would sing with onstage whenever she came through town. A precocious songwriter, Lemon had already cycled through an a cappella band and a punk group by age 12 but then contracted debilitating stage fright that kept her offstage until she was 19. “That kind of opened a million doors for me,” Lemon says of her first show as an adult. “That rush of performing for people was reintroduced.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Merce Lemon holds her cat, Moldy, By that point, Lemon was living with her uncle in Seattle, where she finished up high-school taking courses at a community college. Lemon’s best friend died when she was 15, making her already unpleasant schooling experience that much more dreadful. Rather than drop out, her mom suggested she move across the country for a reset. It was at that first show in Seattle where Lemon met Dylan Hanwright of indie-rock favorites Great Grandpa, who offered to record her debut album in his basement studio. Making Ideal… was a great experience for Lemon, but she struggles to revisit those songs today because of how “scared” she sounds on the recordings. It’s certainly a far cry from the confidence she displays in 2024, standing tall and firm behind the mic at shows and projecting her voice into long-tailed croons on Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild. “Somebody came up to me after a show in Seattle,” Lemon recalls, “and was like, ‘I love the shakiness in your voice.” They figured her nervous quivering was an artistic affect. “I was like, ‘I’m literally shaking.’” When Lemon returned to Pittsburgh around 2017, she didn’t have friends in the scene, so she asked her dad and another middle-aged family friend, Jim Lingo, to be her bandmates. Lemon says being in a band with her father was a great experience that brought them closer together; he never tried to steer control away from his daughter and always respected her creative vision. After three years of building regional momentum through steady gigging, the so-called “dad band” era of Merce Lemon entered a proper studio to record Moonth. Unfortunately, the record’s planned release arrived in Aug. 2020 at the height of the George Floyd protests and COVID lockdown. Lemon chose not to promote the album at that time, and with live shows taken away from her and her band virtually dissolved, she put effort into other hobbies. She even considered de-prioritizing music altogether and only treating it as a casual pursuit. “I had lost my joy playing music at that time,” Lemon says. “I just didn’t feel very inspired.” Getting that spark back wasn’t a surefire thing. Slowly, she began writing songs again, documenting her life bit by bit. She put out a call for new bandmates on Instagram and gradually assembled her now-powerhouse lineup: guitarist Reid Magette, bassist Ben Brody, and drummer Pat Coyle. Lemon’s personal life was also undergoing a restructuring. When asked if Watch Me Drive… is a breakup album, she chuckles, as if I noticed something she thought she was being subtle about. She only thinks one track, the wispy ballad “Window,” directly references her former relationship with a farmer that encompassed much of the writing process. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Merce Lemon poses for a portrait at home “It’s like a breakup song [written] when I was still in a relationship,” she says, smiling meekly. “One of those.” Other lyrics that might scan as interpersonal conflicts are actually internal conversations. When Lemon intones “you fucking liar” during the eruptive climax of “Backyard Lover” — the loudest, angriest passage in her whole catalog — the coarse accusation is actually aimed inward at her own self-critical judgments. In the album’s hauntingly gorgeous, piano-speckled title-track, Lemon’s refrain about the thoughts of a husband “weighing down” on her mind have nothing to do with her own marital doubts. The song is Lemon’s creative interpretation of a surreal encounter her family friend had with ’60s folk hero Michael Hurley. The titular dogs being driven wild are the hounds Hurley awoke when he supposedly howled out of his living room window into the dark night. Moreover, the “murderous flock” in “Crow” is about the Pittsburgh crow migration Lemon used to marvel at from her roof in Bloomfield. “These crows know something that we don’t,” she remembers thinking. “I wish I could follow them.” Lemon still isn’t sure where her own migration pattern is taking her. Though she’s now dating someone long-distance, she still views Pittsburgh as an ideal “home base.” She’s more proud of her music than ever, and the intentional effort she’s putting into her band dynamic — to “cultivate fun” and treat everyone respectfully — is paying dividends. They're having a blast. She and her label have big aspirations for Watch Me Drive…, and with recent coverage by tastemakers like Pitchfork and glowing endorsements from buzzy national bands like Squirrel Flower and Babehoven, it seems like Lemon’s profile is blooming. So what’s missing? “I’m just excited to put this thing out so that maybe it will open up some metaphorical space in my head so I can start writing again,” she says. “That always happens. I’m like, I can't start this other thing until I let go of this project.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Music, Merce Lemon, Frankie Cosmos, Florist, Darling Records, The Moldy Peaches Related Content Pittsburgh’s “incredible noise machines” are changing local rock By Eli Enis Feb 5, 2025 Pittsburgh musician Merce Lemon drops out of SXSW \"in solidarity with Palestine\" By Amanda Waltz Mar 8, 2024 Two new-ish Pittsburgh albums you should know By Jordan Snowden Aug 20, 2020 Photos: Silent Saturday Strip District By Jared Wickerham Apr 5, 2020 Latest in Music 156/silence's atmospheric metalcore is reverberating far beyond Pittsburgh By Eli Enis Mar 11, 2025 Shaggy on 25 years of “It Wasn’t Me,” his BFF Sting, reggae's roots, and the Pittsburgh show that ties it all together By Kate Oczypok Feb 21, 2025 Pittsburgh’s “incredible noise machines” are changing local rock By Eli Enis Feb 5, 2025 Tim Heidecker talks Bob Dylan, songwriting, and Pittsburgh ahead of Spirit show By Matt Petras Feb 5, 2025 More » More Music All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

Every year, the festival — taking place this year from March 8-16 — makes Austin, Texas a gathering place for hundreds of music acts and celebrities, as well as leaders across tech, entertainment, and other industries. For Pittsburgh indie rocker Merce Lemon, who was chosen to play the 2024 SXSW Music Festival Showcasing Artists lineup, it meant sharing space with over 300 artists from around the world and gaining exposure to new audiences, possible representation, and more. But on Tuesday, Lemon announced via Instagram that she pulled out of the SXSW over concerns that the festival supports defense contractors with ties to the deadly Gaza conflict. \"I refuse to be free advertising for an event that is directly tied to the genocide of Palestinian people,\" Lemon wrote. The post quoted Squirrel Flower, another 2024 Showcasing Artists musician, who pulled out of the festival \"because SXSW is platforming defense contractors,\" and cites \"Raytheon subsidiaries\" and the U.S. Army, which is listed prominently on the festival's website as a main sponsor. Besides Lemon and Squirrel Flowers, several other slated SXSW music acts have also boycotted the festival, including Proper, Mamalarky, Eliza McLamb, Shalom, The Curls, TC Superstar, and Villagerrr. Dr. Devon Price, an autism research advocate set to speak as a panelist at the festival, announced on Instagram that he withdrew for similar reasons. The boycott has quickly made headlines, including a story from The Guardian outlining how Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies, the former name of what is now RTX, is sponsoring parts of the SXSW Pitch tech showcase. The article points out that RTX is \"known to supply weapons to the Israeli government\" and quotes RTX chairman and executive director, Greg Hayes, as telling shareholders last year that the company would benefit from \"increased demand for weapons during the war in Gaza.\" A statement from Collins on the SXSW website describes how the company would use its presence at the 2024 festival to launch its second Powered by Collins Initiative, \"designed to foster technology innovation with Deep Tech small- to medium-sized enterprises.\" The U.S. Army, which, in a March 4 press release, identified itself as an SXSW \"super sponsor,\" has had a major presence in the West Bank training Palestinian Authority security forces. A Washington Post article published on March 5 reported that many see the current iteration of the Palestinian Authority as \"Israel’s repressive subcontractors,\" and quoted Alaa Tartir, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, as saying it “is not for the security of the Palestinian people\" and \"was reformed in order to deliver stability, security coordination and Israeli security first.\" A document shared with City Paper cites the long list of companies and organizations whose SXSW participation led to the boycott. These include other known defense contractors viewed by the SXSW boycott movement as profiting from a conflict that, according to a report released this month by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, has displaced 1.7 million people across the Gaza Strip. The report also states that, since the conflict began in Oct. 2023, nearly 31,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank have been killed, a vast majority of whom are women and children. Pittsburgh City Paper reached out to SXSW for comment but has yet to hear back. Instead of performing at SXSW, Lemon and others will perform at alternative shows taking place in Austin during the festival. Lemon is now slated to perform on Sun., March 10 at Far West Fest and at \"SXSW Unofficial\" music events organized by Smash By Smash West, a new summit organized as a way to raise awareness around the more harmful, exploitative aspects of the yearly festival.

A high school lunch bell rings, kicking off a tense classroom conversation where Avery (Michelle Do) cancels a Friday date with the film’s star, Sama (Hibah Abdellatif). But as the shot pushes in, Pittsburgh viewers might find their gaze drawn away from the drama to a map of the city and its three rivers, clipped to the classroom door. “I added that there very specifically on purpose,” writer-director Dandashi tells Pittsburgh City Paper, among other Pittsburgh “easter eggs.” In the next scene, Sama rages in a music video-like fantasy sequence in her bedroom, but you can still spot a Steelers flag on the wall and a Pittsburgh tote bag hanging over the door. A Pittsburgh native, Dandashi wanted Baba I’m Fine, which has its world premiere at the South by Southwest Film and TV Festival on March 8, to “capture the texture of Pittsburgh [and] the nostalgia that came with growing up here.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Karina Dandashi Baba I'm Fine writer/director Karina Dandashi Filmed in the city and featuring a majority local crew, Dandashi credits producers Stephen Turselli and Dan Duthie from Pittsburgh-based Solano Pictures for helping create “that sort of texture and feeling on the screen to give you a sense of a specific place.” Baba I’m Fine “explores a father-daughter story close to my heart and hometown,” Dandashi writes in the film's synopsis. The coming-of-age short reflects her “complicated” adolescent relationship with her own father, a Syrian Muslim who immigrated to attend the University of Pittsburgh. The family has deep roots in the region — “a melting pot for us,” Dandashi says — with her maternal grandfather immigrating from Ireland to work on the Pennsylvania Railroad. “I think, for this film specifically, what I really wanted to capture is [a] feeling of frustration,” Dandashi tells City Paper. “It's the idea that growing up, I felt like my immigrant parents knew everything about me, but also nothing about me.” The 13-minute short takes the viewer on an odyssey of Pittsburgh when Sama’s father (Aladeen Tawfeek) attempts to cheer up his lovelorn daughter and salvage her Friday night. There’s an impromptu trip for dinner at Salem’s Market on Penn Ave. — a place Dandashi frequented growing up — and a drive up to the Mount Washington Overlook. If that seems like a cheesy dad spot, Dandashi confirms she was inspired by her own parents’ love for it, imagining the overlook as the kind of place the film's father would take his daughter for a “big, bold grand gesture.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Karina Dandashi Baba I'm Fine For much of the film, it's also unclear how much Sama's father knows about her relationship with Avery, again reflective of what Dandashi describes as the “idyllic ‘ignorance is bliss’ relationship” she had with her own father growing up. But as the evening in Baba I'm Fine progresses, the parental relationship softens, culminating in a “main character moment” for the film's father, Dandashi says. There's also a “little bit” of a visual reference to the famous Fort Pitt tunnel scene from another Pittsburgh-shot coming-of-age film, The Perks of Being a Wallflower (Dandashi cites Me and Earl and the Dying Girl as another favorite). “I feel like a lot of times Arab dads, especially with queer stories, and especially through the Western lens, they're seen as very one-dimensional. The strict dad or the mean dad,” Dandashi tells CP. “I wanted to create a dad that, despite the nuances and the misunderstandings between father and daughter … [is still] silly and goofy and soft, and bring the softboi lens to the Arab dad.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Karina Dandashi Hibah Abdellatif as Sama in Baba I'm Fine Dandashi hopes the short will serve as proof of concept for her coming-of-age feature, Out of Water, also set in Pittsburgh. She's unsure how the international audience at South by Southwest will react to seeing Pittsburgh and its “visual gems,” like the neon Heinz sign, on screen. For Pittsburgh audiences, Dandashi has also submitted Baba I'm Fine to local film festivals, and a Pittsburgh premiere is in the works. “Hopefully people want to see more,” Dandashi says. “I hope to make future work in Pittsburgh, because I think it's such a great city to put on the big screen. It has such a beautiful specificity to it ... So it would be really special to make more work [here].” Watch the trailer for Baba I'm Fine below: Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Screen, Karina Dandashi, SXSW, Solano Pictures, Stephen Turselli, Dan Duthie, Hibah Abdellatif, Video Related Content Pittsburgh musician Merce Lemon drops out of SXSW \"in solidarity with Palestine\" By Amanda Waltz Mar 8, 2024 Latest in Screen Pittsburgh Sound + Image launches funding campaign to restore local film \"treasures\" By Owen Gabbey Mar 3, 2025 Looking back on The Blair Witch Project as Pitt adds the film to its archives By Amanda Waltz Feb 27, 2025 Noah Wyle takes us inside The Pitt and his family’s local connections By Kate Oczypok Feb 11, 2025 Stream these lesser-known movies shot in Pittsburgh By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 6, 2025 More » More Screen All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

The decade's biggest hits (see: Scream) were less concerned with originality and more focused on smugly deconstructing the slasher tropes that made them possible, starting with Hitchcock's Psycho. American viewers were stuck with tired sequels in franchises far past their prime, mildly entertaining teen screams, and bad remakes, with the occasional bright spot mixed in (Candyman, for one). Cut to 1999. I'm spending a summer weekend with my friend at her dad's cabin. I find an issue of Entertainment Weekly left on a table while visiting a nearby lakehouse snack bar. I flip through the magazine until a full-page ad grabs my attention. White text against a striking black background reads: In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found. My 16-year-old mind was blown. From then on, the impending release of The Blair Witch Project received my full attention. My equally morbid girlfriends and I speculated over cafeteria lunches: Was it real? Would they ever find the bodies? How far away is Burkittsville, and should we skip school to drive there? A Sci-Fi channel “documentary” titled Curse of the Blair Witch, with its archival-looking footage and other markers of authenticity, added to the theory that something was indeed amiss in Maryland. Over 25 years after its theatrical release, The Blair Witch Project joins the University of Pittsburgh Library System's Horror Studies Collection, which acquires and preserves scripts, photos, props, and more from projects by George A. Romero and other influential horror directors. According to a press release, The Blair Witch Project producer, Gregg Hale, donated “marketing and promotional items like missing person posters and production materials,” and “reviews, articles, games, comics, and other tie-in media demonstrating the film’s impact.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of the University of Pittsburgh The Blair Witch Project archival materials acquired by Pitt's Horror Studies Collection “We’re thrilled to find a permanent home for our collection of records, memorabilia, and ephemera from a little horror film that lucked its way into cinema history,” Hale stated in a press release. The film's impact reached far beyond scaring the pants off rural teens like myself, who wondered if the surrounding Pennsylvania wilderness also held deadly secrets. Besides giving horror a jolt of much-needed creative energy, it launched a new subgenre in found footage, and, as Ben Rubin, Horror Studies Collection coordinator at the Hillman Library, states, it revolutionized marketing by leveraging the then-burgeoning internet. It bears mentioning that one of the most influential horror films of all time was also co-written/directed by a Cuban American filmmaker, Eduardo Sánchez. As Rubin points out, The Blair Witch Project was a lightning-in-a-bottle phenomenon that would be nearly impossible to pull off today. “They took a huge gamble on producing and marketing a film on the internet at a time when nobody else in the industry was doing that,” Rubin tells Pittwire. “It showed you could do viral internet marketing, which now is hand-in-hand with any other marketing technique for films.” The gamble paid off as the ultra-low-budget film — made for an estimated $60,000 — went on to gross nearly $250,000,000 worldwide from moviegoers, many of whom, like myself, went into the theater still wondering if what they were about to see was real. When the film came out on VHS, I took my birthday money to a mall FYE and snagged a copy. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of the University of Pittsburgh Ben Rubin, coordinator of Pitt's Horror Studies Collection at the Hillman Library, recreates the final scene in The Blair Witch Project Not only was The Blair Witch Project my introduction to found footage, but it was also my introduction to film as I'd never seen it before — instead of the slick 35mm blockbuster features I grew up with, here was a tiny square on a big screen, as the projector ran the 16mm and Hi-8 camcorder footage. A few years later, I'd make my own horror projects in film school using the same stock and technology. Pitt will begin processing The Blair Witch Project collection in the spring. However, fans can now see select materials displayed on the third-floor Archives and Special Collections Exhibit Gallery in the Hillman Library.

A pro team is the logical next step By Colton Coreschi click to enlarge Photo by Alex Mowrey courtesy of Pitt Panthers Athletics Pitt volleyball players celebrate during a game vs. Notre Dame on Oct. 27. In a city fully devoted to its professional sports teams, the most remarkable success story in local sports in 2024 might not be the Steelers, Penguins, Pirates, or Riverhounds, but instead the recent domination of the Pitt Panthers women’s volleyball program, whose success and growth — both on the court and off of it — is a trend approaching a different level of craze. With the Panthers soaring on and off the court, could it be time for a professional volleyball team in the Steel City? Since head coach Dan Fisher took over as the program migrated to the Atlantic Coast Conference from the now-defunct Big East in 2013, the volleyball program has reached unimaginable highs. During Fisher’s tenure, the Panthers have won six ACC championships, made a program-record eight straight NCAA tournament appearances, including first-time trips to the Elite Eight; and three consecutive trips to the Final Four. This year, the Panthers have been otherworldly. With a 29-1 record as of Nov. 30, the No. 1 seed Panthers aim to make another deep tournament run — but the program’s growth hasn’t been limited to on-court dominance. The ever-growing fanbase of the team has generated crowds in historic numbers. Earlier this season, the team set a new attendance record with 11,800 turning up to see a heated rivalry match with Penn State at the Petersen Events Center. Another contest there against ACC contender Louisville drew 11,309 — and most matches at Fitzgerald Field House have hovered around the 2,000-3,000 mark all season. “The support has been amazing; sometimes it feels even better than winning the game,” Pitt volleyball associate head coach Kellen Petrone tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We used to have these crowds of 100 people. Now, to have sellouts at the Petersen Events Center, it’s great. We always want to be entertaining, to put on a show. I think people really are blown away when they see volleyball in person, how explosive and athletic it is compared to TV.” With growing crowds and teams full of nation-leading talent, it's natural to wonder: What’s next for these players after their collegiate career comes to a close? And what’s out there for volleyball fans in Pittsburgh beyond the Panthers program? The question is one being asked all across the U.S. as volleyball soars in popularity — and several organizations have stepped up with answers. In 2025, there will be three separate professional options for volleyball players domestically: Athletes Unlimited, a unique five-week league with no set teams; League One Volleyball, set to begin play in 2025 with an underlying club system; and the Pro Volleyball Federation, which concluded its inaugural 2024 season back in May. “I think that’s one of the main reasons why we started this,” says PVF Vice President of Public and Media Relations Rob Carolla. “It was a sport our founders saw that didn’t give players a place to play here in the United States. They had to go to Asia or Europe, and we wanted to give these great volleyball athletes a chance to play near family and friends close to home. It was a big selling point for us.” While any professional sports expansion is an involved process with many deciding factors, on the surface the case for Pittsburgh looks obvious. While some PVF teams are oriented around market-size and geography, the league has a clear focus on cities with large collegiate programs, even in smaller media markets. These include Omaha (Nebraska), Columbus (Ohio State), Orlando (UCF), and Indianapolis (Indiana/Purdue). “I would say [support] is definitely a part of it, for sure,” Carolla says of the expansion process. “You want to have cities and markets where there’s an interest in the sport. That obviously exists very well in Pittsburgh, and with what’s going on at Pitt — that factors into the interest. Pretty good support for the sport itself, that doesn’t hurt.” With Pitt’s strong and growing athletics foundation, and a sports-hungry city underlying it all, Pittsburgh would seem to be an obvious fit among these, particularly with several nearby Midwestern trips among the league’s existing clubs. click to enlarge Photo by Alex Mowrey courtesy of Pitt Panthers Athletics A packed Petersen Events Center during a match vs. Louisville Another meaningful factor? Talent development. With an increasingly talented program, Pitt has produced several professional players already in the PVF. These include Leketor Member-Meneh (Indy Ignite/Atlanta Vibe), Courtney Buzzerio (Atlanta), Chiamaka Nwokolo (Indy), Kayla Lund (San Diego Mojo), and Layne Van Buskirk (Vegas Thrill). All players excelled during Fisher’s tenure with a long list of accolades and accomplishments between them. “We talk to [our pro alumni] all the time,” says Petrone. “They come back here in the summers and help coach our camps. One great thing about the PVF is they can coach at collegiate programs, keep fresh and keep training. We get a lot of them coming back here, we had a bunch at alumni weekend, we talk to them all the time. I think, hopefully, in the upcoming year you’ll see some more Pitt players joining them at the pro level.” All things considered locally, it’s easy to see Pittsburgh as an appealing expansion prospect. But as mentioned, any expansion is a complicated process, and the key remaining factor in volleyball coming to the city remains a dedicated ownership group who wants it here. “We’ve had a ton of interest,” says Carolla. “Of course, first and foremost, you want a good ownership group in place in the market of their interest, and then in conjunction with that whether the market can support it. It’s been exciting because the interest in the league is absolutely there.” So while Pittsburgh awaits the leaders to make pro volleyball a reality, fans can continue to follow the elite Panthers players at the next level with the hope that, maybe one day soon, those players can stay home and represent the Steel City directly. — Pitt women’s volleyball will compete in the NCAA tournament beginning today (Dec. 4).

Rotenstein click to enlarge Joe Tito (far left) and friends photographed at Happy Hollow in 1941. Each year, the Pirates hit the road for spring training in Florida. It’s an annual rite that dates to the 1940s. But the Sunshine State wasn’t always where the Buccos got into shape for the major league season — between 1889 and 1923, the Pirates and their predecessor, the Alleghenies, trained multiple times in Hot Springs, Ark. So did Pittsburgh’s Negro League teams, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays. “Pittsburgh trained at the spa more than any other team,” says baseball historian Don Duren. Dubbed the “Spa City,” Hot Springs is famous for its thermal waters, which sparked a robust tourism economy in the 19th century. Industrialists, artists, mobsters, and athletes regularly descended upon the small city in the Ouachita Mountains to enjoy the waters, golf, and gamble. Many well-heeled Pittsburghers spent their late winters in Hot Springs and summers in Atlantic City. Hot Springs was Las Vegas before there was a Las Vegas. There are strong historical ties, from professional sports to organized crime, connecting the Spa City with the Steel City. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy Klein-Tomanio family George Jaffe (middle row, third from the left, and Jake Klein, middle row, fourth from the right) with Jaffe’s Picaroons ball team photographed in Hot Springs in 1921. George Jaffe (middle row, third from the left, and Jake Klein, middle row, fourth from the right) with Jaffe’s Picaroons ball team photographed in Hot Springs in 1921. Baseball in the Spa City Hot Springs is the birthplace of spring training. In 1886, A.G. Spalding (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and Adrian “Cap” Anson brought the Chicago White Stockings (who later became the Cubs) to Hot Springs before baseball season began. It “was the perfect spot for the boys to sober up and work out,” explains narrator Billy Bob Thornton in 2016 documentary The First Boys of Summer. There had been earlier, intermittent preseason barnstorming trips into the South by baseball players, but these weren’t organized. “They would come down there and play ball and try to get some teams to play so they could get some money to go back up the road,” says Duren in an interview from his Texas home. Duren, 86, grew up in Hot Springs and wrote Boiling Out at the Springs: A History of Major League Baseball Training at Hot Springs. The White Stockings set a new pattern when they returned to Hot Springs in 1887. Other teams followed, and a new system was born. “They ran the mountains and took the baths and played a little baseball,” says Duren. By 1910, most of the professional teams, including the Pirates, were training in Hot Springs. Honus Wagner, who played and coached basketball in the offseason, took the Hot Springs High School basketball team under his wing by becoming their coach. After learning that the team needed uniforms and gear, Wagner shipped uniforms (in Pirates colors), shoes, and balls from his Pittsburgh sporting goods store. The high school’s teams, the Hot Springs Trojans, continue to use the black and gold as their colors. Owners and managers liked that Hot Springs offered rural seclusion and easy access to nature — it became the nation’s first federal reservation, a precursor to national parks, in 1832. Despite being illegal, casino gambling flourished there starting in the 1870s. When the White Stockings began training there, Hot Springs was a wide-open city stacked with casinos, brothels, and speakeasies. By the turn of the 20th century, access to Hot Springs’ vice was as much of a determining factor for baseball players’ decisions to train there as the training facilities themselves. Babe Ruth loved Hot Springs. “Ruth was a perpetual conventioneer on the prowl. I wish the teams still trained in places like that, where they’ve got brothels and horse racing and gambling and everything,” Ruth biographer Leigh Montvville told an interviewer in The First Boys of Summer. “He got into all of it. I think he just went crazy.” A mob favorite Racketeers also discovered Hot Springs, and they liked to travel there for spring training, too. Betting on baseball games added to the city’s appeal. The ball games complemented the Oaklawn Jockey Club’s racetrack. By the time nationwide Prohibition hit in 1920, Hot Springs had become the nation’s first sin city. “Hot Springs really was one of those cities that personified the nexus between sports, politics, and the rackets,” says University of Pittsburgh historian Rob Ruck, author of Sandlot Seasons: Sport in Black Pittsburgh and a biography of Steelers founder Art Rooney. After sporadic visits before 1900, the Pirates trained in Hot Springs over two stretches, between 1901 and 1916 and again between 1920 and 1923. The second period coincided with the rise of one of Pittsburgh's earliest racketeers, George Jaffe. Jaffe owned Pittsburgh’s only burlesque venue, the Academy Theater. He and his brothers, Milt, Morris, and Joe, built a bootlegging and gambling empire in Pittsburgh. Starting in 1922, George Jaffe began racking up arrests for running a brothel in the downtown hotel he owned, and on gambling charges. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy Klein-Tomanio family George Jaffe (seated, second from the left) with his “Pittsburgh Delegation” photographed in Hot Springs in 1924. Steelers founder Art Rooney and gambler Jake Klein were among George Jaffe’s closest friends. The two regularly joined Jaffe on his annual pilgrimages to Hot Springs. Jaffe typically rented a railroad car and filled it with relatives and associates. Pittsburgh’s newspapers reported on Jaffe’s Hot Springs trips between the early 1920s and 1950s. In Hot Springs, the Jaffes and their pals golfed and watched (and presumably bet on) horse races at the Oaklawn Jockey Club, and mugged it up at an amusement park called Happy Hollow. Photos taken there show the Jaffes, Klein, and Rooney posing for the camera in a fake speakeasy and staged rural “hillbilly” scenes. One photo with Klein and Rooney mirrors a similar one taken a few years later with Chicago mobster Al Capone in the same place. The Jaffe bunch also played baseball in Hot Springs. In 1921, the Pittsburgh Post published a photo of Jaffe’s sandlot team, the Picaroons. They were, the paper wrote, “the unofficial advance guard of the Pirates.” The lineup included Jaffe and Klein. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy Klein-Tomanio family Pittsburgh gambler Jake Klein and an unidentified woman photographed at Happy Hollow in an undated photo. Rooney’s ties to Hot Springs included a friendship with exiled New York mobster Owney Madden. After Madden moved to Hot Springs in 1935, he oversaw the local rackets for his New York partners, including Charles “Lucky” Luciano. Hot Springs played a bit part in the 1932 kidnapping of Milt Jaffe. According to newspaper accounts, George Jaffe traveled to Hot Springs to pay a $30,000 ransom for his brother. The Jaffes, though, denied the kidnapping rumors and described the episode as an April fool’s prank. “George denies the whole story,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. “He went to Hot Springs, Ark., and met his brother, but it was his regular annual vacation trip there.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy Richard Tito Joe and Katherine Tito photographed at Happy Hollow. Segregated spring In the late 1920s, Negro League ball teams began training in Hot Springs. Both of Pittsburgh’s teams, the Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, were regulars there. “In a way, it makes them big league,” says Ruck. “Their training and working out and playing in the same area where I believe major league squads are, I think, heightens that sense of their legitimacy.” But Hot Springs was still the South, and it was rigidly segregated. “They had, I guess, a little town out here for them down on Malvern Avenue in Hot Springs and they had hotels down there,” says Duren. “They had bathhouses.” The Grays, in 1930, were the first Pittsburgh Negro League team to train in Hot Springs. They joined the Kansas City Monarchs. Two years later, in 1932, the Crawfords began a multi-year run in Hot Springs. It was the year after Crawford Grill owner Gus Greenlee bought the team. Greenlee was one of Pittsburgh’s and the nation’s leading Black organized crime figures. He got his start in bootlegging and graduated to numbers gambling. By the time he died in 1952, he and William “Woogie” Harris were among the leaders in an informal Black crime syndicate dubbed the National Brotherhood of Policy Kings. Joe Tito, an Italian American bootlegger and gambler who later introduced Rolling Rock beer to Pittsburgh and beyond, was Greenlee’s Crawfords co-owner and partner in the Hill District’s Greenlee Field. Tito family photos from the early 1920s show Joe and his brothers enjoying themselves at Happy Hollow and other Hot Springs locations. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy Klein-Tomanio familyJake Klein and Art Rooney (behind bar) photographed at Happy Hollow in the early 1920s. A yinzer legacy Black and white teams continued to train in Hot Springs through the 1930s. By 1940, Florida and Arizona had replaced Hot Springs as major league baseball’s spring training mecca. The Depression economy played a part. The emergence of Las Vegas and Florida as leading tourist destinations also contributed to Spa City striking out and leaving the field. Happy Hollow was replaced by a motel. There’s a parking lot where the field that Babe Ruth, in 1918, hit a 500-foot homerun. Some of the hotels and bathhouses Pittsburgh ballplayers and racketeers frequented are still there, including the Woodmen of the Union Bathhouse and Sanitarium, where Black visitors stayed, and the Arlington. Hot Springs still boasts of the times that Honus Wagner, Satchel Paige, and Josh Gibson were part of the community, and there are still places where Pittsburgh history may be found in the Spa City. While those days of vice are in the past, the Arkansas hotspot started a baseball tradition that continues to this day. click to enlarge Photo courtesy Gregory Hansen Happy Hollow historical marker Editor's note: The historical marker photo above was miscredited in an earlier version of this story.

The most recognizable intersections of art and sports are the ones where sport-related artworks are exhibited, and when sporting events feature art forms such as painting, dance, or music. These convergences tend to be highlighted as if sports and the arts are worlds apart — on the surface, they appear to be, but they aren’t so different. Sports and the arts, in their purest forms, are beautiful pastimes passionately pursued and engaged. Communities form around amateur participation and observation of both. They have extensive histories and can teach creativity, ingenuity, teamwork, and discipline. They can be mindless entertainment or platforms for social change, unification, and the pursuit of justice. At the highest level, sports and the arts require immense skill that, to truly appreciate as a spectator, demands rigorous study. At their worst, art and sports are tools for capitalist ambitions that disregard everything sacred, fueling divisive communities that only care about winning at the expense of everyone and everything else. click to enlarge Photo: Kelly Perkovich Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre dancer Corey Bourbonniere Regarding Pittsburgh, it could be argued that the city is to sports as it is to art. The mid-sized City of Champions is home to the Carnegie International, the longest-running North American exhibition of international contemporary art, and world-famous pop artist Andy Warhol. Industry similarities aside, there’s a lot of overlap in the performance of art and sport. Making art is often physical, and the playing of sport is often artistic. I appreciate sports through an artistic lens, and it can be frustrating when the city’s attention towards sports leaves little focus on art. This includes closing the Carnegie Science Center during Steelers home games (which I get, but also don’t believe to be completely necessary). click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A painting of Willie Stargell and a star honoring him at PNC Park. I believe that sports can be a platform for art if we’re willing to recognize the art that occurs organically within and around the game. This can go beyond collaborative marketing campaigns, beyond artists throwing out first pitches, beyond athletes who appear as celebrity guests during the party scene in Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s annual performance of The Nutcracker. Speaking of ballet, consider the movement of athletes. I’ve seen Steelers running back Najee Harris leap over defenders with as much grace as PBT dancer Corey Bourbonniere. And while a spin move by Penguins center Evgeni Malkin might not be as graceful as a figure skater, it's just as marvelous when you consider he’s doing it against defenders while escaping the violence they’re legally allowed to enact. The movements of Penguins legend Sidney Crosby are reminiscent of Pittsburgh-born choreographer and MacArthur Fellow, Kyle Abraham. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A painting of Roberto Clemente seen at PNC Park. This image was made using an in-camera double exposure technique. If you have an eye for design, there’s plenty in and around sports to acknowledge — the fields, the jerseys, the stadium signage, the fanmade signage, the graphics on the jumbotron, the equipment, the tickets, and the logos. The Steelers logo, with its three star-like shapes, was adopted in 1962 from the American Iron and Steel Institute’s Steelmark logo. The Steelmark logo was designed by Lippincott and Margulies, a firm responsible for some of the world’s most recognizable corporate designs, including the Campbell’s Soup label appropriated by Warhol. The experience of watching any game becomes much more enjoyable when you know what to look for, and, sometimes, what to listen for. In any game, songs and sounds are essential to the experience. One of many examples of this can be found in ​​Nike’s Basketball Freestyle commercial (2001) where NBA stars dribble and pass a ball around to the rhythm of sounds made during a game. The basketball colliding with the wood before forcefully ascending to its sender’s hand, sneakers squeaking against the floor, the ball diving through the net, the involuntary grunts resulting from bodies crashing, the yank of a steel rim, the slap of a tempered glass backboard, all perfectly blended. In real life, these sounds aren’t meticulously arranged and looped, but there is still a beauty in their organic rhythm that, when combined, can sound as beautiful as a walk in the park scored by birds singing, leaves rustling, and winds bouncing off nature’s architecture. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A mural of Roberto Clemente by Jeremy Raymer painted on the side of Verdetto's on the North Side. Speaking of architecture, there’s plenty to behold at PNC Park, famous for its breathtaking view of the city’s skyline. Architecture, however, isn’t just the design of buildings, it’s how they’re experienced, and how they impact our existence. Every game presents an opportunity to encounter the surrounding architecture. It’s astonishing when the sun sets and the buildings glow Pirates gold, but it’s also breathtaking when it’s Hawaiian shirt giveaway day and the yellow button-ups make the stadium glow from within. There’s a performance of beauty that is unique to every game, and if you appreciate that sort of thing, you should witness as many renditions as possible by going to as many games as you can Instead of awkwardly placing art within the sports world — which can often do a disservice to both pastimes — I propose we highlight the art that already exists in sports spaces, things people love that maybe they didn’t previously consider artistic. The beauty of art is that it’s all around us. It’s not just that we learn to make and place art, it’s that we learn to notice and appreciate it when we see it. In sports, the art is already there.

Altrogge, opens with Pirates legend Roberto Clemente recording his 3,000th hit. It's a moment that cements what was already known, that Clemente was one of the all-time great baseball players, an inner-circle Hall-of-Famer. Yet, in that moment, we also hear the broadcast call the play, and what they call him: “Bob.” Those three letters sum up so much of his experience, and so much of the complex relationship that Altrogge tries to capture in Clemente, which kicks off the Three Rivers Film Festival on Wed., Nov. 13 at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center. Clemente famously hated being called Bob, the “Americanizing” of his name signifying a desire to make the Black Puerto Rican player palatable for white Pittsburghers in the 1960s and '70s. And yet, in his crowning moment, he was Bob. He was what white people wanted him to be. Clemente — which notably won the Documentary Spotlight Audience Award at the 2024 SXSW TV and FIlm Festival — explores one of the most impressive men that has ever graced the city of Pittsburgh (or any city for that matter), while also reckoning that not everyone saw him that way until he tragically died. To be clear, everyone saw him as great on the baseball field. The film covers just how phenomenal he was as a player from an early age, and was being recruited from the time he was a young teenager. The scenes showing Clemente’s grace and unbridled joy on the field are thrilling, displaying a beautiful harmony of power, speed, and finesse. The talking heads support this, as Clemente rolls out an all-star roster to supply stories about the man, including Michael Keaton, Fransisco Lindor, Richard Linklater (who executive produced the film along with LeBron James and Roberto Clemente Jr.), and Rita Moreno. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Vinegar Hill Clemente But there’s a story occurring parallel to Clemente’s brilliance on the field, and it’s one of the turmoil and struggle he faced navigating life as a Black Puerto Rican in a deeply racist Pittsburgh. He never felt comfortable in the city, as he was often treated by fans as a man whose race and ethnicity could be overlooked by how good he was at baseball. Clemente navigates this topic with a deft touch, an effort negated by a sledgehammer the filmmakers most likely didn't see coming. Heavily featured in the film is Roberto Clemente Jr., speaking at length about his dad, and all the sacrifices and hardships he faced. It would behoove us not to mention that the junior Clemente gave a ringing endorsement of Donald Trump at the last rally for the President-elect, the day before the election — this is despite that fact that Trump has been accused of withholding relief aid to Puerto Rico after the U.S. territory was hit by Hurricane Maria in 2017, during his first term. Reconciling a film that so lovingly portrays a man who battled discrimination, while prominently featuring his son who gushed about a figure who stands for everything that his dad would’ve despised, is a difficult balance. But the senior Roberto comes out clean, his unwavering commitment to public service always shining through. Up until his death in 1972, when his plane crashed during a relief mission to earthquake victims in Nicaragua, he represented everything that Pittsburgh should be, a model leader even when the city didn’t always want him as one. Clemente, as a documentary, isn’t doing anything radical with the form. It’s your classic sports documentary, talking head footage mixed with highlights of its subject's life and career, occasionally intercut with animation when a point can’t be made with archival photos. That being said, if you’re unfamiliar with the legendary athlete's life and legacy, or you just need an uplifting story, Clemente is worth your time. The documentary is complicated, unruly, and not without its flaws, but also deeply inspiring with its look at the resilience in the face of hatred, discrimination, and the New York Yankees. Three Rivers Film Festival presents Clemente. 7 p.m. VIP reception at 6 p.m. Wed., Nov. 13. August Wilson African American Cultural Center. 980 Liberty Ave., Downtown. $50-200.

His mother attended Chatham University, and his dad went to Carnegie Mellon. Wyle, now 53, has found himself back in the city where his parents met, filming the HBO Max drama The Pitt, which centers on a fictional Pittsburgh emergency room. He says authenticity is key to the show, which was filmed partly at Allegheny General Hospital. “We were looking for a city that hadn’t been overshot,” Wyle tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “Pittsburgh is also a wonderful microcosm of the country. It’s got great diversity of population, a large socioeconomic range, and it’s both urban but surrounded by rural areas, so you’ve got a great cross-section of cases.” Wyle is no stranger to medical dramas, as he starred as the young Dr. John Carter in the long-running medical drama ER. In The Pitt, Wyle is now the seasoned veteran Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch. The Pitt is gritty, realistic, and, at times, quite dark. Each episode depicts one hour in an emergency room, painted as a post-pandemic hellscape of people waiting hours for care. Viewers occasionally see Wyle’s character in flashbacks, dressed in a hazmat suit at the height of COVID. While we have yet to learn more about the trauma Dr. Robby experienced during the pandemic, it is hinted at enough to keep viewers intrigued as each hour-long episode gets us deeper into the day. The hour-by-hour set-up of a 15-episode, 15-hour shift in the emergency room was a decision made by former ER producer and The Pitt show creator R. Scott Gemmill. click to enlarge Photo: Warrick Page Attending nurse Princess (Kristin Villanueva) and Dr. Robby (Wyle) discuss a case on The Pitt “He wanted it to feel much more like you’re doing a ride-along with a cop on a shift, or maybe you’re a war correspondent, and you’re embedded with a combat unit during a campaign, so that it’s an adrenaline rush to be a voyeur in this environment,” Wyle says. “You’re not dispassionate, you’re engaged emotionally, and the best way to do that is to not give you a sense of relief.” Everything instead plays out in real time, giving both viewers and the characters they’re watching an endurance test of sorts. “Everyone wants the same relief, and it creates this nice, kind of symbiotic relationship,” Wyle adds. The Pitt was an idea born in the pandemic while Wyle was sitting at home and not working. He would get emails from first responders thanking him for inspiring them to go into their careers or keeping them inspired. “They were very confessional about how hard it was, what they were going through, and what they were seeing,” Wyle says. “I thought to myself, man, there may be more stories to tell here.” Wyle, along with Gemmill and fellow former ER producer John Wells, got together and soon realized they all had the same feeling: the pandemic changed everything in healthcare. “There was a sort of B.C. and A.D. aspect when it came to medicine, and we needed to start investigating what the other side of that demarcation looks like, specifically for the practitioners who have been on duty the entire time, the toll that it’s taken, and the fragility of the system,” Wyle says. click to enlarge Photo: Warrick Page Dr. Oscar Flores (Manny Streetz Guevara) and Dr. Robby (Wyle) speak with a patient in The Pitt Dr. Joe Sachs, a board-certified emergency room physician, is a technical advisor, writer, and producer on The Pitt (and was on ER too). “[Sachs] set up a series of interviews with just about every expert from every aspect of the healthcare system that you can imagine,” Wyle says. “One of the first questions we asked is: what isn’t on TV that you think should be on TV, and what in your job specifically would you love to have mentioned?” Wyle, who was on ER for most of his 20s and 30s, has made himself available and as much of an open book as possible for the young cast of The Pitt. “It’s tricky; you don’t want to sound like an old fuddy duddy know-it-all,” he says. He is happy to provide any advice and tips, but he calls The Pitt cast a “pretty sophisticated bunch.” “I was really surprised and impressed at how quickly they hit the ground running,” he says. “I think back at my old castmates on ER, and I realized we were all probably the class clowns at our school.” The Pitt cast is made up of what Wyle calls “probably the top students” at their schools who “hated the class clown.” “Most of the time, I try not to embarrass myself by telling what I think they think of as dad jokes,” he says. Wyle and The Pitt’s creators did talk to Pittsburgh doctors while creating and filming the show. While Wyle himself wasn’t able to get much sightseeing done while filming in the city for the first season, he plans to visit ER castmate Ming Na Wen’s family’s restaurant, the Chinatown Inn, on Third Ave. downtown. On Feb. 10, he returned to visit Allegheny General and met with staff, who called the show “enormously realistic.” “Hopefully [that will] grease the wheels to allow us to come back for a season two,” Wyle tells City Paper.

I know because I was among them, hooting and hollering, grateful that Pittsburgh pride remains undefeated. Though the region has positioned itself as “Hollywood East,” it’s still a thrill to see it on screen, and in my movie-watching at least, a relative rarity. We’ll always have our go-to Pittsburgh movies that make the city look magical, like Striking Distance, The Dark Knight Rises, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and horror classics Night of the Living Dead and Silence of the Lambs. But for those of you who get excited at the mere sight of the Smithfield Street Bridge, curl up and settle in with these lesser-known movies filmed in Pittsburgh. Desperate Measures (1998) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Sony Pictures/Mandalay Entertainment Michael Keaton in Desperate Measures This San Francisco-set, but mostly Pittsburgh-shot action thriller features Michael Keaton as a crazed serial killer bolting across the Bridge of Sighs. This comes to pass thanks to a high-wire plot where a police officer (Andy Garcia) finds that the only bone marrow match for his leukemia-stricken son is a convicted killer (Keaton). In a bizarro Pittsburgh version of John Q., Garcia’s character breaks Keaton out of a supermax prison to make the transplant. Predictably, things go awry, leading to a madcap chase through Downtown Pittsburgh — viewers will recognize the Allegheny County Courthouse and BNY Mellon Center on Grant St. — with explosions, helicopters, snipers, SWAT, and, of course, a bridge scene. Where to stream: Amazon Prime Video, YouTube TV, Apple TV, Google Play The Clearing (2004) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Robert Redford and Willem Dafoe in The Clearing I happened to watch The Clearing, a movie about the kidnapping of a rental car company tycoon, the day after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and found it to be a rich text. (When the news broke, I immediately thought of another quickly forgotten Pittsburgh movie, Sweet Girl. In the 2021 Netflix release, a grieving husband, played by Jason Momoa, strangles a Martin Shkreli-like character who denied his wife life-saving care, inside the Carnegie Music Hall. Quarter-zip vests truly are the mark of the beast.) The Clearing is a quieter, more contemplative entry in the eat-the-rich genre, loosely based on the real-life kidnapping of a Dutch businessman in 1987. The movie is anchored by a trio of heavy-hitting actors — Willem Dafoe as the abductor, Robert Redford as his captive, and Helen Mirren as Redford's stricken wife — and by Pittsburgh itself. Get hooked as you watch Dafoe take the T into Downtown, drive through the Armstrong Tunnel, and ominously pick up a briefcase and envelope, or stick around for a ransom drop at the Omni William Penn Hotel. Where to stream: Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV The Cemetery Club (1993) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Kino Lorber Poster for The Cemetery Club Pittsburgh shines as an action movie backdrop, but what about for a ‘90s rom-com? The Cemetery Club is centered around three Jewish widows who pay a weekly visit to their husbands’ graves in Allegheny Cemetery (which has never looked better on film). The ensemble of \"three divas\" — as described by famed actor/director Bill Duke — includes Olympia Dukakis, Diane Ladd, and Ellen Burstyn, who make this movie a delight even before Burstyn’s character peels off for a date at the Original Oyster House with a suitor played by Danny Aiello. The movie is poignant on its own (and boasts a 12-year-old Christina Ricci), but Duke brings a Striking Distance-like reverence to filming scenic swaths of Pittsburgh, and I lost count of the number of recognizable locations. Dig in for Downtown vistas, a gaudy wedding with an 80-year-old groom at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and another memorable scene at the William Penn. Where to stream: Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV The Next Three Days (2010) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Lionsgate Russell Crowe and RZA in The Next Three Days I’m not sure how unsung The Next Three Days is (I suspect it might have a cult following already), but it should be considered a Pittsburgh classic. The crime thriller belongs in the yinzer canon if only for Liam Neeson leaning over during a prison visit to utter, with his full Irish brogue, “Pittsburgh’s tough.” The Next Three Days kicks off with leading lady Elizabeth Banks nearly getting into a drunken fistfight at the Grand Concourse, getting wrongfully arrested for murder in the next scene, and then quickly evolving into its true form — a Pittsburgh jailbreak movie. Brennan’s mild-mannered husband (Russell Crowe) stages her escape amidst the region’s bridges, tunnels, and inscrutable belt system, all looking spectacular with peak fall foliage. Enjoy the ride and some choice views from Mount Washington (and don’t scrutinize the escape route too much). Where to stream: Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV Mrs. Soffel (1984) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of MGM/United Artists/Warner Bros. Matthew Modine, Mel Gibson, and Diane Keaton in Mrs. Soffel I’ve probably obsessed over Mrs. Soffel and the Biddle brothers enough, but we used to be a proper country that made these kinds of smoldering romantic dramas, and Pittsburgh should rightfully claim this one. Mrs. Soffel dramatizes the Biddle brothers' real-life escape from the Allegheny County Jail in 1902 (yes, that’s three jailbreak movies on this list), aided by the besotted prison warden's wife, Kate Soffel. The movie stars Mel Gibson and Matthew Modine as Ed and Jack Biddle, and Diane Keaton as Kate. I have mixed feelings reporting that the chemistry between Keaton and Gibson is absolutely out of pocket, and on its own makes Mrs. Soffel worth the watch. But Mrs. Soffel took the true crime element to a new level by filming inside the Allegheny County Courthouse and the actual old Allegheny County Jail where the Biddles were imprisoned. If you know the story, you already know our protagonists' fates, but you can still buckle up for the chase with real-life police detective Charles “Buck” McGovern portrayed by Terry O'Quinn (aka John Locke from Lost). Mrs. Soffel celebrated its 40th anniversary on Dec. 26, and I’m raising a glass to it.

McArdle Roadway with a still from Striking Distance overlaid on top For those who haven’t recently watched Striking Distance — the Pittsburgh-based action thriller released 30 years ago this week — it’s easy to forget how madcap the action is. In the movie’s first 15 minutes, a serial killer identified as the Polish Hill Strangler dumps a body in a dam, then lures stars Bruce Willis and John Mahoney, playing Pittsburgh police, on a high-speed car chase — leading Mahoney to deliver the film’s most iconic line, “Take Bigelow.” Though Pittsburghers might raise an eyebrow at the impossible route, the pursuit that follows shows Willis driving against traffic on a recognizable Bigelow Boulevard, speeding down Mount Washington, through Downtown, and across the Smithfield Street Bridge. Cars flip, catch fire, and explode in the Armstrong Tunnel, then go airborne at 60 miles per hour as they crest a bumpy cobblestone hill (filmed in Duquesne). Even the film’s crew was a bit stunned at the time, Striking Distance location scout Steve Parys tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “The cars were flying into the air and bouncing and light bars were flying off of them,” Parys recalls. “It was just nuts. It was berserk. To see these stunt guys go full out and the cars are throwing pieces off themselves. It was just this whackadoo excitement that every day was like, OK, what the hell are we doing now?” Slideshow Striking Distance: Then and Now Click to View 16 slides Premiering Sept. 17, 1993, and starring a then up-and-coming Sarah Jessica Parker, Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, and Willis — whose fame was stratospheric after Die Hard — Striking Distance was slated to be, as Parys put it, “a big frickin' action movie.” In addition to the land-bound escapades, Willis’ character joins the River Rescue squad, stirring up fights on boats and barges, and action across Pittsburgh’s three rivers (the movie’s original title). But script rewrites and reshoots delayed Striking Distance’s release, and it ultimately opened to lackluster reviews. Roger Ebert wrote at the time, “It’s a tired, defeated picture, in which no one seems to love what they’re doing, unless maybe it's a few of the character actors.” Cop clichés aside, what the movie doubtlessly had going for it was the way it showcased Pittsburgh and made the city a part of the action — a goal of writer, director, and Pittsburgh native Rowdy Herrington — and one of the reasons it endures as a beloved local classic 30 years later. Parys, a 33-year industry veteran whose first movie was Silence of the Lambs, recalls working closely with Herrington to realize his “Pittsburgh-centric project.” The crew scouted locations for four months before shooting. “[We] were always looking for scope and drama and big, exciting locations,” Parys says. “It was always like … let’s get big vistas and big stretches where you can see [the city] in the distance.” Pittsburghers themselves also embraced the production. A farmer let the crew take over his field for days to flip cars (the end of the opening chase sequence), even as heavy rains wreaked havoc and caused them to start sliding down a hill. Before filming a nighttime party scene at the Point, Parys and his team contacted every Downtown building and got them to agree to leave their lights on so that “the city looked really pretty and lit up.” “Pittsburghers want to show off Pittsburgh,” he says. The movie even roped in local news personalities to portray themselves, including a then relatively new WTAE weeknight news anchor, Sally Wiggin. “My hair was huge and I looked ridiculous,” Wiggin recalls. “[But] I loved the movie … I think it was the first time, other than a horror flick, that someone [did] a film in which Pittsburgh was a character.” Wiggin appears twice reading newscasts on characters’ televisions — first on Willis’, and then again when the movie’s murderer is revealed, and he knocks over his TV set in a fit of rage. “I love the part where he kicks the TV … and there I go, I'm done. I thought that was my moment,” Wiggin said. The cast and crew also took to the city — which doesn’t always happen, Parys says — with Bruce Willis, then-wife Demi Moore, and their daughters seen riding the Steel Phantom at Kennywood. Willis — who’d been performing as his pop singer alter ego Bruno Radolini — also made a habit of singing at Donzi’s in the Strip District. (The Boardwalk, the now long-closed, multilevel floating nightclub of which Donzi’s was a part, even resembles the houseboat where Willis’ character lives.) click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson / Photo: Courtesy of Columbia Pictures/Sony Home Entertainment Strawberry Way with a still from Striking Distance overlaid on top Parys also recalls that local bars — notably Chiodo’s, formerly in Homestead — opened their doors to production in the early morning hours after they’d worked through the night filming. The atmosphere on set was “convivial” and “it was really like an exciting adventure to go out and shoot this stuff,” he says. Parys speculates that the continued appreciation of the movie also relates to its practical effects. He estimates that, now, about 80% of the action scenes would be computer-generated or shot with actors on green screen. For a shoot-out on Second Avenue, the crew used dust hits for bullets and squibs to blow out glass on cars. Parys remembers a stunt double “went smashing through a fence and crushed a couple cars.” (The number of totaled cars seems to be a point of pride for the whole production; Herrington mentioned wrecking 40 of them when commenting on the movie’s anniversary to KDKA last month.) In a later scene, Willis pursues the killer again and shoots a flare into his car. “We really did that!” Parys exclaims. “We did that with a real flare gun.” The loss of practical effects also portended the end of the mid-budget thriller in general, so part of the nostalgia for Striking Distance could be for a bygone era of film. “That kind of mid-level, character-based, plot-heavy action movie, it just doesn't exist anymore,” Parys said. For those looking to get their Striking Distance fix, Parys recently spotted part of the set at the Rock Room in Polish Hill. Now an assistant director, he was shooting the second season of American Rust at the bar when he saw a roped off “Detillo’s Roost” sign, which originally hung above a cabin door in the movie. “I was like, son of a bitch, that’s from Striking Distance!” Parys says. Apparently, the sign had changed hands several times: “[it’s] through some weird ‘his sister's brother's aunt worked on the movie.’” Parys, also a Pittsburgher, says, for him, it spoke to the movie’s longevity, an unexpected delight. When friends and family ask which movies he’s worked on, he’ll often “reel off” a long list and “their faces are blank and their eyes are dead, but then you say Striking Distance, and all of sudden they’re like, ‘Oh God, you worked on that?!’” “You're in a bar, and you hear the guy next to you say, 'oh yeah, Bruce Willis was so cool in that movie.' Or you go into the Rock Room and there's a sign that makes you think back about it,” he says. “It’s just neat that it’s still in the public consciousness.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Screen, Bruce Willis, Sarah Jessica Parker, John Mahoney, Rowdy Herrington, Mount Washington, Sally Wiggin, Demi Moore, Kennywood, Polish Hill, Rock Room, Slideshow Related Content Your Halloween to-do list in Pittsburgh By CP Staff Oct 24, 2024 ‌The big, spooky Pittsburgh event guide: Oct. 3-Oct. 31 By CP Staff Oct 2, 2024 A round-up of Kennywood mascots past and present By Rachel Wilkinson Jul 29, 2024 The big Pittsburgh summer events guide By CP Staff Jun 19, 2024 Latest in Screen Short film Baba I'm Fine is a nuanced love letter to Pittsburgh and immigrant fathers By Rachel Wilkinson Mar 7, 2025 Pittsburgh Sound + Image launches funding campaign to restore local film \"treasures\" By Owen Gabbey Mar 3, 2025 Looking back on The Blair Witch Project as Pitt adds the film to its archives By Amanda Waltz Feb 27, 2025 Noah Wyle takes us inside The Pitt and his family’s local connections By Kate Oczypok Feb 11, 2025 More » More Screen All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

And if you haven’t yet made the most of spooky season here in Pittsburgh, never fear — there’s still plenty of time to celebrate, whether you prefer bone-tingling scares, family-friendly fun, costume parties, horror films, or a completely unique experience. Below, we’ve compiled a list of Halloween events and attractions arahnd tahn, and tips to help you make the most of the end of October — starting with haunted dining then moving along to local Halloween attractions, a yinzer costume quiz, and tons of frightfully fun events. Eat, drink, and be spooky Dine with ghosts Fall has arrived, and that means it’s spooky season. Legend holds that as nights grow longer, the veil separating the material and spiritual worlds thins, bringing haunted happenings and unseen forces. For whatever reason, the veil in Pittsburgh has always been extra permeable, and the region boasts a preponderance of places believed to be haunted. For this year’s Fall Guide, Pittsburgh City Paper zeroed in on some of our favorite haunted restaurants and bars (and the list we offer is by no means complete). From a ghost lady in white to a haunted railroad station to a lurid Biddle brothers connection, these eerie establishments are sure to make your hair stand on end — or at least offer a storied place to grab a beer.

Taking place at the Greer Cabaret Theater on Thu., Oct. 24 from 6-9 p.m., the event and cultural celebration is hosted in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Create ornaments for two “mural-like” community ofrendas, altars that commemorate loved ones. Enjoy a taco bar, signature Mexican- and Latin-inspired cocktails, and “lively beats” from DJ Mateo Mattos. The event page notes that the happy hour is “more than just a gathering” and invites the community to “share stories, and toast to life, memory, and connection” in appreciation of Día de Los Muertos. If you can’t make this celebration, never fear — there are more Dia de los Muertos celebrations all around Pittsburgh! Halloween falls on a Thursday this year, but Bar Crawl Nation stretches the festivities into the Day of the Dead with a Boos Fest Halloween Bar Crawl. On Sat., Nov. 2 from 5-10 p.m., Pittsburghers are invited to “a Halloween party spanning multiple themed bars” promising spooky cocktails, prizes, a haunted red carpet, and “hundreds” of costumes.

But few establishments are quite like Harold’s or have embraced their apparitions quite like the Millvale bar, whose name is even a dig at a local ghost. Pittsburgh paranormal investigators Bump in the Night Society also reported seeing specters in a room in Harold’s basement. Harold’s owner and others had previously tried to walk into the same room only to see the lightbulb inside shatter.

Every year, the Pittsburgh Halloween staple has lured crowds with high-quality frights executed by dedicated, professional scare actors and crew members. Oscar-winning horror filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and actor Elijah Wood gave ScareHouse their approval and, in 2023, it earned the title of Top Haunt by the Haunted Attraction Association. ScareHouse returned this year on an appropriately spooky date (Fri., Sept. 13) with three concepts — The Basement, an extreme haunted attraction brought back after several years, the ongoing Stalked By A Serial Killer escape room, and the new, vampire-themed Chipped Fang immersive mocktail pop-up bar. Each experience runs through Oct. 31. Read more: ScareHouse heads back to the basement after several difficult years Let them eat worms Kennywood’s Phantom Fall Fest is a Pittsburgh staple as well. Fall Fest is packed with actors dressed to the nines ready to scare parkgoers. These spooky attractions are perfect for yinzers and out-of-towners ages 13 and over. Kennywood has extended their hours now through Oct. 27. Last week, several contestants devoured mealworm-garnished Potato Patch fries for a chance to win season passes. But we promise you won’t have to eat any worms to enjoy the festival.

The company would do most of the work, setting up the concept, creating the cocktail menu, and taking care of ticketing. All Grace Emmerling and Jeff VanFossan had to do was sit back and watch the guests roll into the space, which, in October 2023, became a Tim Burton-inspired Halloween affair, then the holiday pop-up bar, Tinseltown: The Christmas Speakeasy. “They then took 100% of the ticket sales and we were able to collect on the bar,” Emmerling tells Pittsburgh City Paper, adding that they saw it as a great opportunity to establish the bar they bought and reopened and had, at that time, been managing for less than a year. “We were looking to bring people in, and that final quarter of the year is a really critical quarter for the service industry. So it was really attractive to us because we felt like we were getting an audience that we would not have otherwise had … So that's why it was a good fit for us at the time.” Emmerling says that, while their working relationship with Viral Ventures was positive overall, they had to take a more hands-on role, as representatives from the Australia-based company were often off-site working on other projects. Viral Ventures also faced controversy in 2021, with Pittsburgh patrons claiming that the global company had underdelivered or misled them, taking them down a confusing rabbit hole defined by an apparent lack of customer service, a business model that included operating under several different names (including Immersive Ventures and Hidden Media Network) and websites, and a no-refund policy. As a result, in January 2024, Emmerling and VanFossan decided to cut ties with Viral Ventures and pursue their own original immersive concepts. Since then, Mixtape has transported guests into Alice in Wonderland, the world of Nintendo-era video games, a Hogwarts-like magical academy, and a graffiti-splashed subway honoring 1980s hip-hop culture. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Mixtape [•RE]MIXTAPE Since Oct. 2, the bar has welcomed guests to The Nightmare Before Mixtape, a new iteration of the immersive experience that started it all. A giant, inflatable, neon-green version of Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas hovers over Mixtape’s signature sign, and inside, murals of Jack Nicholson’s Joker from the 1989 Batman film, black-and-white Beetlejuice striping, and other Burton-esque touches are meant to delight revelers looking for Halloween fun. Emmerling says the choice to do the immersives independently has given them the freedom to create a “canvas for local talent,” commit to levels of quality and creative expression not possible under Viral Ventures, and ensure that the money they make stays in the city. She and VanFossan recruited a team of artists led by muralists Max “GEMS” Gonzalez and Shane Pilster, set designer Johnmichael Bohach, and others to execute colorful visions accented with interactive elements like arcade consoles (for Super Mixtape 64) and themed cocktails. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Mixtape Super Mixtape 64 The immersive experiences add an appealing extra layer to Mixtape’s regular event roster, which features DJ dance parties that play everything from New Wave hits to funk, karaoke, speed-dating mixers, and more. So far, Emmerling says patrons have reacted positively to The Nightmare Before Mixtape. “Jeff was just kind of standing outside on the corner while a group of people were going in for a session, and he heard someone say, ‘This better be different than last year’ or something. And then they opened up the front door and they're like, ‘Whoa.’” Emmerling credits much of the concepts' success to focusing on minute details, especially when catering to pop culture fans, adding, “Whether it's video games or Alice in Wonderland or Tim Burton or Halloween in general, people pick up on the little things.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Mixtape Wonderland at Mixtape The thoughtfulness of Mixtape’s approach contrasts with several disastrous immersive experiences hosted by companies similar to Viral Ventures. This year, a Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow, Scotland, and a Bridgerton-inspired ball in Detroit both generated headlines for promoting grand ideas, only to deliver sparsely decorated venues, subpar food and drink, and bizarre, unthematic entertainment, leaving attendees demanding refunds and feeling scammed. October promises more spooky happenings in Mixtape's decorated space, including a Burton Ball on Sat., Oct 26, followed on Wed. Oct. 30 by a pre-Halloween sober disco night co-hosted by The Open Road, a non-alcoholic bottleshop that recently moved from Allentown to Garfield. Emmerling foresees continuing the Mixtape immersive experiences through the end of the year, but believes the frequency and amount of work involved makes them unsustainable over the long term. Even so, she doesn't want to abandon what has been a creatively fulfilling effort for her and VanFossan. “But next year we'll definitely do it in some capacity,” she says. “This year, we changed every two months, pretty much like clockwork, and I don't think we'll do that … I don't know if it will be quite as frequent.”Mixtape. 4907 Penn Ave., Garfield. mixtapepgh.com Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, Mixtape, Viral Ventures, Grace Emmerling, Jeff VanFossan Related Content Your Halloween to-do list in Pittsburgh By CP Staff Oct 24, 2024 On the Tahn: Terror Vision and other dance parties in Pittsburgh (Dec. 22-23) By Amanda Waltz Dec 21, 2023 On the Tahn: Anime Night and other dance parties in Pittsburgh (Dec. 14-16) By Amanda Waltz Dec 14, 2023 On the Tahn: Hot Mass and other dance parties in Pittsburgh (Dec. 7-9) By Amanda Waltz Dec 7, 2023 Latest in Arts + Entertainment Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 From three rivers to 412, count the ways numerology is significant to Pittsburgh By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 6, 2025 Punxsutawney Phil fans line up at Wigle Whiskey to meet their \"god\" at Phil-a-Palooza By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 24, 2025 Before Stormy Daniels, there was Canned Peaches By David S.

Mixtape Garfield lost a gathering spot, bar, and sometimes dance club when Mixtape shut down in 2020, seemingly a victim of the early, panicked days of COVID-19. Since then, the space under the giant cassette tape sign has sat empty. Now, under new ownership, Mixtape will continue with its signature sign and name intact. Today, Mixtape officially returns in full after a month of ticketed soft opening events. Under the ownership of operations manager Grace Emmerling and her partner, local DJ Jeff VanFossan, the space will be open from Wednesday through Sunday with a regular schedule of weekend dance parties and weekday “chill nights,” according to an announcement on Instagram. The space also features a full bar, a generous selection of board games, and a pinball machine. Emmerling tells Pittsburgh City Paper that the idea to reopen Mixtape first came up in 2021 during one of the First Friday Unblurred gallery crawls on Penn Avenue, where Mixtape is located. At the time, she had already bought and was in the process of converting another Garfield property, the former Most Wanted Fine Art gallery, and hesitated to embark on another project. Still, she recalls looking at the vacant space and thinking the avenue was “just thirsty” for a place like Mixtape. Out of curiosity, she called one of the previous owners, Katie Molchan, who opened the business with her then-partner Elaina Holko. “I remember calling Katie and saying, maybe, hypothetically, if perhaps we thought about potentially buying it, what might that look like? And it just kind of took off from there,” says Emmerling, who, along with VanFossan, had previously owned and run a record store/music venue/coffee shop in downtown State College, Pa. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz Mixtape in August 2022 Emmerling also thought having a “music-themed cocktail lounge” would be a great sister business to her other Garfield venture, a yet unopened record store and pinball arcade called Slanted and Enchanted. She says Molchan and Holko agreed to sell the entity Mixtape LLC to her and VanFossan, meaning they could keep the identity of the once-popular spot along Penn Avenue’s arts and business district. They also acquired other aspects of the entity, including the cocktail recipes. Emmerling says they changed little since acquiring the business, adding that the previous owners kept it in “impeccable” shape. Throughout January, the new Mixtape has welcomed crowds for events ranging from Babeways, an inclusive, all-femme DJ dance party and fundraiser for the abortion nonprofit, Western PA Fund for Choice, to a ball celebrating the late David Bowie’s birthday. The focus makes sense given that VanFossan has, for years, run the popular local dance party, Strangways. Emmerling says they turned to family members and out-of-state investors – who she calls “minority shareholders\" – to help them buy the property. However, Emmerling stresses that she and VanFossan are in total control of the operations. “I just felt so thankful that we went this way to finance it because it's offered so much freedom for us to do exactly what we want to do,” she adds. “We have people who trust us and who we trust, who love us and say, go for it.” click to enlarge Photo: Christopher Sprowls Photography. Grace Emmerling, co-owner and operations manager of Mixtape In a phone interview from her home in Alexandria, Va., where she relocated with her wife, Holko expresses her love for Emmerling and VanFossan and believes they have the “perfect energy” for Mixtape. “Mixtape was originally my idea, and I always did want it to be a little more DJ, a little more dance night, but we just could never really get those to take off or get people to pay a cover,” says Holko. “But they have so much experience with that, with Jeff’s Strangeways project and everything, that I was like, wow, you guys are the exact people that should have opened this in the first place.” Holko reflects on some of the decisions she and Molchan made for Mixtape that, at the time, distinguished them from other venues in the city. This included the creation of a full mocktail menu for sober patrons, and doing away with a tipping system for bartenders, who were instead paid a fair wage. Any tips given were instead donated to local organizations like Pittsburgh Action Against Rape. Looking back, Holko believes they tried to do too much, too fast, including trying to implement a food program. That and some personal issues made the business more vulnerable when the pandemic hit. “The pandemic, that was a lot to just recover from, being a business that was less than five years old,” says Holko. “We were on that no-tipping model, and we were coming to the realization that was just not sustainable. It took two of us working full-time off payroll for years and years and years, and we just couldn't catch our breath. So, you know, if we were going to reopen, we probably would have had to kind of do a rework anyhow and get out of that model, because we were just drowning in payroll taxes and expenses … We couldn't give the staff what they deserved.” She believes Emmerling and VanFossan will continue what made Mixtape a destination for many people, including the mocktail menu. “They've told me, especially knowing now that, you know, I'm sober, ‘Come back, we'll have a mocktail ready for you,’” she laughs. “As far as I know, they seem like they definitely want to keep that.” Mixtape. 4907 Penn Ave., Garfield. mixtapepgh.com Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, Grace Emmerling, Jeff VanFossan, Katie Molchan, Elaina Holko Related Content In a world of scam immersive experiences, Mixtape delivers legitimate delights By Amanda Waltz Oct 18, 2024 Latest in Arts + Entertainment Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 From three rivers to 412, count the ways numerology is significant to Pittsburgh By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 6, 2025 Punxsutawney Phil fans line up at Wigle Whiskey to meet their \"god\" at Phil-a-Palooza By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 24, 2025 Before Stormy Daniels, there was Canned Peaches By David S.

Murder trials became a sort of theater in the 1990s with the advent of Court TV and sensationalized cases like the Menendez Brothers and O.J. Simpson. That theater will, to a certain degree, unfold at The Funhouse at Mr. Smalls when the audience plays judge and jury to a series of women on trial for murder. RealTime Arts presents ANGELMAKERS: Songs for Female Serial Killers, a musical production described in a press release as exploring \"the moments and motives of female serial killers throughout history,\" from the 1500s to the present. The show, which takes place from Thu., Oct. 24-Thu., Oct. 31, features various local female-identifying talent, including musical theater performers Julianne Avolio, Drew Leigh Williams, and Jacquea Mae, Vietnamese pop star and activist Mai Khôi, Pittsburgh rocker Liz Berlin, and others. Molly Rice and Rusty Thelin conceived the show together, drawing inspiration from the 2007 book Female Serial Killers: How and Why Women Become Monsters by Peter Vronsky. At the time, Thelin says he was in the process of writing a play about a female serial killer. \"I read the book as research and then I couldn't finish the project.\" Thelin, who co-founded and now serves as executive director for RealTime, tells Pittsbrugh City Paper, adding, \"I had this real strong feeling of, I can't write this character.\" Shelving the script, Thelin gave the book to fellow RealTime founder, Rice, thinking she would find it interesting. After reading the book, Rice tells City Paper she was mainly struck by the fact that every subject had a chapter dedicated to telling her story. ANGELMAKERS unfolds as a concert with each song dedicated to a different woman, similar to the book's chapters. The songs range widely in content and style, with rock, post-punk, '80s pop, and country. \"I really don't know why it seemed like it ought to be a concert,\" Rice, who serves as RealTime's artistic director, chuckles. \"You can bear a lot with music. By doing that, you know, if we can keep people in a place where they can hear some of the more humanistic parts of these women's lives through music, is there a way that we can open up the definition of humanity to include everybody, including the people that do the worst things?\" The first ANGELMAKERS debuted in 2017 at Aftershock Theatre, a performance space based in a former Slovenian social hall. Since then, it has been staged in Pittsburgh and New York City. Past versions of the show included songs that covered Elizabeth Báthory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman notorious for allegedly killing young women and bathing in their blood; Jane Toppan, a nurse in 19th-century Massachusetts who confessed to over 30 murders; and Aileen Wuornos, a sex worker who was executed in 2002 for fatally shooting seven of her male clients. A new song will appear in the 2024 show, written by Rice with Mari Frazé-Frazénko, a humanitarian parolee from Ukraine. Entitled “Disappear,” it's described as being dedicated “to the [women] in wartime.” In addition, Mai Khôi will perform an original piece with clarinetist Lenni Green. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of famousinNY ANGELMAKERS at 54 Below in New York City, 2018 From its humble beginnings, the unconventional show has evolved into a live performance that seeks to captivate audiences as an \"exploration of both rage and empathy.\" Rice and Thelin emphasize that the production is not about glorifying violence but instead examining the circumstances and societal influences that contribute to these women's actions. \"We hope this piece will evoke responses of discomfort, fascination, distance, and compassion responses that, in a larger sense, we all need to learn to negotiate if we hope to understand those who are fundamentally different from us,\" Rice says. Founded in 2015, RealTime Arts has a history of producing innovative theater. Each performance is collaborative, bringing together musicians and actors from diverse backgrounds to create a powerful, cohesive experience. Rice, who wrote all of the songs, included bits of court testimony and quotes from interviews in the lyrics. \"They really do illuminate all of the challenges that I think women go through to this day. That contributed to the horrible things they did, not to excuse them at all,\" Rice continues. Rice and Thelin envision making ANGELMAKERS a touring production that continues to evolve with each performance. They express excitement about the potential for new collaborations and guest artists who would offer fresh perspectives and expand the show's reach. The ultimate goal is to create a dynamic and ever-changing experience that resonates with global audiences. ANGELMAKERS offers a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, challenging the audience to consider the complexities of empathy and morality. In a statement, Rice and Thelin explain, \"Our culture is fascinated with true crime, but women aren't usually at the center of the story unless they're victims of male killers. ANGELMAKERS asks: how do murderous obsessions exist differently in women than in men, and does our fascination with violence change when it's a woman who's committing it? What iniquities influence the making of these 'monsters'? And how different are they from ourselves?\"RealTime Arts presents ANGELMAKERS: Songs for Female Serial Killers. Showtimes vary.

Real/Time Interventions at Aftershock Theater, 115 57th St., Lawrenceville. $20. [email protected] People losing their minds over Netflix’s Mindhunter emphasizes our deathless fascination with serial killers. Angelmakers, an engrossing new stage work from Real/Time Interventions, explores the often-neglected world of women who kill again. Angelmakers is no docudrama, nor a play. It’s an hour-long cabaret of ten songs, most in the voices of true-life killers. Beirut-based performer Milia Ayache sings and plays guitar, backed up by Pittsburgh musicians Zorahna, on bass, and drummer Michele Dunlap. Little links the characters Ayache channels beyond murder; co-creators Molly Rice (songwriter) and Rusty Thelin (director) eschew overarching themes, though shrine-like stage dressings and ritual business between tunes supplies atmosphere and suggests that these eight murderers warrant remembrance. As the show’s tagline goes, “Everyone deserves one song.” If it’s provocative to have empathy for killers, the troupe pulls it off, thanks largely to Rice’s lyrical gifts (familiar to audiences of The Saints Tour — Braddock, Real/Time’s immersive 2015 collaboration with Bricolage Production Co.). “There is a poison made of only our breath,” sing Gwen Graham and Cathy Wood, nurses’ aides who killed five elderly patients. “You think he’s gonna sing low, the devil, but he’s gonna sing high, way way high, like me,” preaches Velma Barfield, a devout Pentecostal who poisoned six, in another standout number. Other characters include Aileen Wuornos and the vampiric Countess Elizabeth Bathory (b. 1560). Rice doesn’t always match musical genre to character and time period. So while Gwen and Cathy’s theme suggests a ruminative ’80s dance hit, Janet Toppan, a nurse executed in 1938 after murdering 33 patients, gets a nervy, Jim Carroll-like rocker whose refrain goes, “I’m sorry, everybody. I’m sorry I can’t feel it.” There’s humor, too: In her country stomp, Velma notes that roach poison is “only 60 cents!” And Ayache, an arresting presence, showcases her vocal chops in the Gypsy-inflected title track, sung by Hungary’s Zsuzsanna Fazekas, who encouraged women to poison irksome family members (“I’ll show you how to make him an angel”). Angelmakers is staged in a former Slovenian social hall in Lawrenceville, freshly gutted and undergoing renovation as Aftershock Theatre. A preview performance felt a bit tentative, but I’m guessing that by the time you read this the cast will be totally killing it.

Staab Pittsburgh Public Theater presents Trouble in Mind An old Devil moon glowed above the stage of the O’Reilly Theater as a saxophone droned a jazzy reverie to awaken the timely and timeless characters of Alice Childress’ Trouble in Mind from unjustified obscurity. This seldom-performed American satire is a true ensemble piece that stands out in the Pittsburgh Public Theater’s latest season. The play follows a diverse collective of actors as they attempt to mount a Broadway play set in the Antebellum South. They navigate the racial overtones of the show's fictitious play and the racist undertones of the production team. Although Childress’ play first premiered in 1955, the dialogue is strikingly modern and achingly poignant. With a few small changes and an alternate set of costumes, the show could easily and believably be set in the present day as an indictment of the current theater industry. Throughout the production, Justin Emeka shines as a director, choreographer, and fearless maestro able to achieve a perfect pitch and tempo in the complex dance between comedy and drama, fiction and reality, and oppression and liberation. Emeka’s direction ensures the power dynamics in the play are crystal clear and serve as a sparkling mirror for a modern audience saturated in a culture of racism, patriarchy, and white supremacy. The actors play characters who are themselves acting, not just in the play within the play, but through the obvious code-switching required for them to exist in this white, patriarchal space. In this 10-person ensemble, there are no weak links. Every actor brings themselves fully to this dynamic and thought-provoking production with unbridled honesty and apparent commitment. Sinnerrie D. Jackson, as leading lady Wiletta Mayer, is the powerhouse of the production. She guides the company with her character’s journey from quiet obedience to outspoken rebellion. Her performance feels intimate while remaining big enough for the O’Reilly stage, and she endears the audience with her sharp humor and veteran stage presence. Near the middle of the show, Jackson’s character takes center stage to rehearse a song for the seminal scene of the metadrama. Her voice is a battle cry and an expression of pain that resonates throughout the theater. click to enlarge Photo: Maranie R. Staab Sinnerrie D. Jackson as Wiletta Mayer in Pittsburgh Public Theater's Trouble in Mind In response to Jackson's show-stopping power, Joseph McGranaghan proves a master of despicable villainy as director Al Manners, the self-righteous white savior in a 1950s-era Broadway world. I imagine a chill shot down the spine of every woman in the audience who has ever been touched by a powerful man in the workplace when, at one point, Manners stands directly behind Judy (played by Emma Brown Baker) and wraps his hands around her shoulders. click to enlarge Joseph McGranaghan and Emma Brown Baker in Pittsburgh Public Theater's Trouble in Mind Manners is easily outnumbered during the show, but the illusion of his supremacy and financial power reaffirms his grip on the company. He slowly unravels as each company member challenges his judgment, intentions, and assumed superiority. McGranaghan captures the griminess of Manners and foils Jackson’s heroic performance as Mayer beautifully. KJ Gilmer’s costume design acts as a sturdy scaffolding for each performer. While period costumes can run the risk of stealing the show, Gilmer’s work enhances, rather than distracts from each actor's performance. Emma Brown Baker, as Judy, struts onto the stage for the first time in a bright blue skirt suit, looking like the spitting image of a Pan Am stewardess in a vintage LIFE Magazine ad. This complements Baker’s portrayal of Judy as a follower, someone willing to go along with trends, a struggle she straddles throughout the show. With every outfit, Gilmer re-establishes the power dynamics Emeka sets up, adding an extra layer of strength to the impressive production. click to enlarge Photo: Maranie R.

He gently bumbles about the stage with the charm and warm-heartedness of a beloved grandfather. His brogue crackles like a gentle fire and adds a cozy twinkle of paternal love to the character dynamics.

I began to curl into myself when a little girl with round blue glasses and a smile of innocence greeted me from her perch behind the counter. “Can you draw me a picture?” she asked. It was as if she had been transported from the pages of Saint-Exubery’s The Little Prince and invited me into her world of imagination. I happily obliged. She introduced herself to me as Pepper, and proudly informed me she is 6.5 years old. With lackluster artistic skill, I sketched a scene of evergreen trees on a hillside with a flurry of falling snow. “It looks like ‘Silent Night,’” she told me. Shortly after, I found my seat in the intimate theater, and actor/playwright Jay Sefton humbly walked on stage to begin the 80-minute one-man show based on his experiences with child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. The show, running through Sun., Feb. 16, makes its Pittsburgh premiere as the opener for barebones productions' 22nd season. Sefton — who conceived the show with his co-writer, Mark Basquill — disarms the audience early on with a barrage of humor, the language of the brokenhearted. He sets the scene by detailing how he was cast as Jesus in his eighth grade passion play before divulging his adolescent thoughts about the process, primarily his boyhood crush on the girl cast as the Virgin Mary. He talks about his fantasies of being close to her, and imagines how it will feel to lay in her arms in the pose of Michaelangelo’s \"Pieta\". The audience erupted into laughter before Sefton could get the punchline out, a clear sign of the cultural Catholicism in the room. Sefton is a chameleon in Unreconciled. Each character he portrays is exquisitely distinct. Whether it be his grizzled Philly-born father, a stoic and haunting priest, or his loudmouth childhood neighbors, Sefton entirely transforms his physicality and voice to embody crystal clear characters. The audience is never confused which character is speaking or who is in control — a rarity in solo productions. His performance is bolstered by a production team that employs every possible technique to remind the audience of Sefton’s reality. As he talks through the Philadelphia of his childhood, video clips from Villanova basketball games are projected above him. When he begins describing the passion play of his youth, actual home video from the production is played overhead. During the abuse scene, Sefton held his arms out, mimicking a crucifixion while he described the nightmare encounter his childhood priest forced upon him. Sefton could have chosen to delve into graphic depictions of the abuse, but instead gives the audience a clear picture of what is happening without overindulging in the gruesome details of the attack. The audience may not know exactly what the priest is doing to Sefton, but the raw, vulnerable, and completely honest fear he portrays speaks volumes to the severity of the abuse. click to enlarge Photo: Andrew Greto Jay Sefton in Unreconciled After the height of the abuse plays out, home video from Sefton’s actual eighth grade passion play reappears on the screen. No one dared to breathe when faced with the scathing reality that this footage was taken moments after the abuse. In the clip, the passion play proceeds as told every Easter, with Sefton as Jesus calling out for his father. “My God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?” Sefton cried with outstretched arms. Even those who were unfamiliar with this line of scripture, spoken by a crucified Jesus, could feel Sefton’s desperation for salvation. Sefton’s performance perfectly voices the horrible and complex juxtaposition of longing for the abuse to end and the undeniable uniqueness of being chosen by an authority figure. Instead of shying away from the uncomfortable feelings survivors experience, he leans into the intricacies of victimhood and survival. Sefton, a certified mental health counselor and performer, expertly blends performance with activism. Toward the close of the show, a series of projected slides informed the audience that 24 states had implemented “look-back laws,” legislation that expands the statute of limitations for child sex abuse in order to support survivors coming forward as adults. Pennsylvania is not one of those states, despite widespread sexual abuse at Catholic dioceses across the commonwealth, including in Pittsburgh. This is according to a grand-jury report released in 2018 by then-Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. The current look-back laws in Michigan, my home state, are a result of a major court case against the chaplain from my high school. Simply put, I found Sefton’s story profoundly relatable. Much like my days in Catholic school, I was only able to feel the weight of what I had witnessed once I was alone and no longer sitting in a pew full of people. I sobbed in the car on my way home, mourning for the scared girl in the plaid uniform skirt I once was. But in that same breath, I grew hopeful that a kid like Pepper would never relate to Unreconciled the way I did, as long as people like the team at barebones productions are brave enough to start the conversation. I dream that Pepper will never recognize the silent, knowing glance between those forever changed by clergy abuse. More than anything, I hope she stays — even for just a moment longer — in the safe, silent, snowy landscape I drew for her.barebones productions presents Unreconciled.

Organized by the International Association of Blacks in Dance, in partnership with Hill Dance Academy Theatre, the conference takes place from Wed., Jan. 22-Sun., Jan. 26 at The Westin Pittsburgh. The conference will showcase the breadth of Black dance traditions, from modern and ballet to African diasporic styles, and highlight its intergenerational nature, with performers ranging from emerging youth to elders. This year’s conference amplifies IABD's mission and showcases Pittsburgh's contributions to the art form on an international stage with performances, workshops, auditions, and community classes designed to celebrate and expand the reach of Black dance. Omar Ingram, co-executive director of IABD, highlights the importance of building partnerships in cities with robust arts and culture scenes. For IABD, the decision to bring the conference to Pittsburgh was a natural evolution of its mission. “We looked at cities that had memberships that we had not been to, and through our partnership with [Ayisha Morgan-Lee, founder and CEO of HDAT and a longstanding supporter of IABD], we recognized the significance of this Pittsburgh’s cultural legacy,” he explains. That HDAT is celebrating its 20th anniversary provided an additional milestone, making Pittsburgh a fitting location to celebrate Black dance and its contributions to the arts. The city inspired this year’s theme, The Bridges We Build: From Revolution to Legacy. As Ingram notes, “Pittsburgh is known for bridges. Bridges connect land masses. We’re using this theme to talk about how Black dance connects people.” click to enlarge Photo: Scott Robbins, Geek With A Lens The International Conference and Festival of Blacks in Dance Black dance, in its many forms, has long been utilized for storytelling, resistance, and cultural preservation. Yet, as Ingram points out, “Dance and the arts are a vehicle for conversation. All great art has a political point of view.” While luminaries like Alvin Ailey and Katherine Dunham have cemented Black dance in the cultural consciousness, IABD aims to broaden this legacy, introducing audiences to lesser-known yet equally impactful contributors to the field. The conference serves as both a celebration and a call to action, inviting participants to engage deeply with the history and future of Black dance. The event also serves to elevate Pittsburgh’s local dance community. The opening performance will feature regional artists and companies, and community classes, hosted in partnership with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and Point Park Conservatory, invite attendees of all skill levels to engage directly with the art form. “In every city we visit, it’s key to include the people and institutions that make up the local arts scene,” says Ingram. “That’s how we build bridges that last.” For Hill Dance Academy Theatre, the conference continues its two-decade-long mission to educate and empower young dancers through Black dance traditions. In 2021, HDAT opened its Forever Home for Black Dance in Pittsburgh’s historic Hill District, a 29,000-square-foot campus dedicated to sustaining the legacy of Black dance. At its core, the conference seeks to provide more than performances and classes. Ingram describes the event as a “call-in” for everyone to come together, celebrate, and leave inspired. “The beauty of Black dance and Black art forces a catharsis,” he says. “We want people to walk away feeling welcomed, celebrated, and restored.”International Conference and Festival of Blacks in Dance.

Still, Pittsburgh has its champions, including many celebrities who have shot films and TV shows around the city. City Paper compiled some of the best shout-outs from actors and directors who had a grand time working in the city. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Rises Christian Bale Batman has a strong connection to Pittsburgh, with native Michael Keaton playing the DC superhero, followed decades later by Christian Bale, who portrayed the masked crusader when the city became Gotham for the 2012 blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises. After that, Bale appeared in another film shot in the Steel City, the 2013 drama Out of the Furnace. When he returned once again to shoot the 2023 film The Pale Blue Eye, TribLive reporter Rob Owen asked what kept bringing him back, to which Bale replied, “I had a really wonderful experience the first time when I shot Out of the Furnace, made a lot of great friends, one of whom is your incoming (U.S.) senator, John Fetterman. I love the people of Pittsburgh; the crews are fantastic. Love the people of Braddock. I have a real affinity for that city.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Skydance Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher Tom Cruise Given that Cruise has shot films in glamorous cities around the world, mainly as the lead in the Mission: Impossible franchise, li’l ole Pittsburgh hardly seems notable. But the star only had praise for the location of Jack Reacher, the film he shot here in 2012 — when he appeared at a local premiere event, he spoke on how “warm and gracious” everyone in the community had been to him, adding, “I hope that you’re proud of how your city looks in the film — I’m very proud of the way it looks. I think it’s stunning, I think it’s a beautiful city.” While this may seem like pandering, the fact that his daughter, Suri, recently started attending Carnegie Mellon University points to some truth in his statement. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Jake Gyllenhaal in Love and Other Drugs Jake Gyllenhaal Few celebrities go as hard for Pittsburgh as Jake Gyllenhaal — in 2009, the actor revealed the temporary Steelers tattoo he got after shooting Love and Other Drugs here. However, nothing warms a Steel City heart like the story he told during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live about attending a Steelers game and receiving a treasured, unwashed Terrible Towel from a fan who, upon giving it to him, exclaimed \"I'm a huge fan of Bubble Boy!\" Chloe Sevigny The ultimate ‘90s It girl had a lot of positive things to say about Pittsburgh, where she shot the short-lived series Those Who Kill. A 2014 Marie Claire article lists everything she loved about her stay here, with her gushing about, among other things, the museums, shopping, and drink scene (she praised Kelly’s Bar in East Liberty for making “a darn good martini.”) Kevin Smith While many might balk at the suggestion, Smith’s raunchy comedy Zack and Miri stands as a love letter to Pittsburgh, featuring sights from all around the city and capturing its residents’ odd brand of friendliness, best represented by the drunk Steelers fan who wanders into a late-night porn shoot. Smith, a New Jersey native, has filmed multiple movies in Pittsburgh, including Dogma (which, coincidentally, celebrated its 25th anniversary this year). In 2019, the director shared an Instagram post where he’s posing with frequent collaborator, actor Jason Mewes, outside the Saints Peter and Paul Church in East Liberty, where parts of Dogma were shot. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kevin Smith (@thatkevinsmith) Elijah Wood/Guillermo del Toro Over his long career, Wood has gone from playing wide-eyed moppets to portraying Tolkien’s idealistic hero Frodo Baggins to now producing and starring in numerous, often bizarre horror films. It makes sense, then, that he would be drawn to a spooky town like Pittsburgh: after the veteran actor shot the 2015 film The Last Witch Hunter here, he raved about one particular aspect of the city — the ScareHouse, a haunted attraction that, at the time, operated out of Etna. During an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers (sidenote: it’s worth mentioning that Myers has twirled the Terrible Towel more than a few times as a self-proclaimed Steelers fan), Wood excitedly touted ScareHouse’s amazing effects and “invasive” Basement element.

Given that ScareHouse has suffered several setbacks over the past few years, these endorsements serve as a reminder that preserving these kinds of assets adds to the city's distinct character and makes it attractive to visitors, famous or not.

On the face of it, it’s an origin story as unusual as the film, where, midway through, Kelly unexpectedly finds himself on the set of Charlie’s Angels. As a 25-year-old writer-director trying to pitch the bold debut feature, set around Halloween in 1988, Kelly tells Pittsburgh City Paper in a phone interview, “the consensus was [it was] a great writing sample, [but] I was too young and inexperienced.” “[They said] I should sell the script, let them rewrite it into a horror film, make it contemporary, and let someone else direct it,” he says of Donnie Darko, now considered a cult classic. Kelly visits Pittsburgh on Sat., Oct. 21 for a double feature of Donnie Darko and the \"Cannes Cut\" of his second film, Southland Tales. The movies will screen at the Hollywood Theater in Dormont — recently taken over by Row House Cinema — followed by a Q&A with Kelly and a performance by singer Rebekah Del Rio. On the heels of this summer’s “Barbenheimer” phenomenon — in what some called a new season for auteurs — it seems timely to revisit Kelly’s work, which has long resisted convention. \"I[‘ve] tried to stick to who I am and do these kinds of really complicated films that are not easy to get made and not easy to digest in one viewing,” Kelly says. “I've had many opportunities to do kind a very straight down the middle genre film … and I've said no, very politely I hope.” For Donnie Darko, a lucky break came when Jason Schwartzman, then the rising star of Rushmore, got a hold of the script. Schwartzman — originally attached to play the title role — passed it to Drew Barrymore’s producing partner. Suddenly, Kelly was invited to Barrymore’s trailer on the Charlie’s Angels set, where they talked over a budget with her production company. Barrymore ended up playing the movie’s sage English teacher. (Reflecting, Kelly realizes “technically, I've worked with all three of Charlie’s Angels and what a thrill that has been.”) The origins of Donnie Darko seem less strange, Kelly says, when you consider how much of filmmaking comes down to “a sort of musical chairs … follow[ing] the movie gods and the weather.” But a tale of Hollywood kismet and surreal contrasts seems fitting for Darko — and one could just as easily imagine a world where the film was never made, or where it’s a mainstream contemporary horror flick (in the movie, a duplicate universe exists just beyond our comprehension). In contrast to brooding teenager Donnie Darko (whom actor Jake Gyllenhaal said he performed as an imitation of Kelly) or to any auteur persona, Kelly, now 48, comes across exceedingly pleasant and self-possessed. “I know how lucky I am, and I don’t take that for granted,” he says. “I’m from Virginia, you know? My mom was a public school teacher. My dad worked for NASA.” (These autobiographical details feature heavily in his third film, the 2009 release The Box). At the same time, “I’m such a control freak as a director,” Kelly says. “I’m an Aries. I love being collaborative and having great artistic partners, but I’m not really that sort of hired hand kind of guy … I need to have my fingerprints on everything.” Perhaps it’s this same quality of self possession that led to Southland Tales, Kelly’s 2006 sophomore film still widely thought to be, as one reporter put it, “one of the most ambitious, spectacular, and commercially disastrous oddities in Hollywood history.” For those unfamiliar, the nearly three-hour movie is: set in the near future of 2008; begins with found footage of a nuclear attack; stars Dwayne Johnson as a prophetic action star, alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, and Justin Timberlake, who plays an Iraq War veteran; sends up the Patriot Act, military-industrial complex, infotainment, celebrity culture, and climate change mitigation; and has a plot point involving a rip in the fabric of spacetime. Since its release 17 years ago, the movie has been the subject of a Salon explainer (“It's OK to be confused by Richard Kelly’s Southland Tales,” it begins) and a 6,000-word deep dive (now on Vice) in which the reporter is so intrigued that she seeks out Kelly and goes through the movie point by point with him. A City Paper review called Southland Tales “a heady, dystopic epic/satire about nuclear war” (there’s also a musical element) that is “lousy with ambition and verve, but tough to follow.” It’s possible the film’s expansiveness can be chalked up to this: Kelly says there are few things he loves as much as world building. He considers all three of his films to be unfinished — “I so wish that I had more movies to screen, I really do,” he says — but none, he stresses, more than Southland Tales. Originally based on a series of graphic novels he wrote, Kelly imagines an “improved screenplay” that would allow him to shoot new sequences, some animated, and add more advanced visual effects. “Even if I’m in a nursing home one day and I’m just supervising some sort of virtual reality animation for it, to finally finish Southland Tales, that’s my bucket list goal,” Kelly says. “I joked one day that I [could do] it with sock puppets.” This year, Kelly has been touring with his films, re-engaging with audiences for the first time in awhile. The Fluid Karma tour — named after the inexhaustible, ocean-powered energy source in Southland Tales — is in large part a response to work stoppages caused by the SAG-AFTRA strike. But it also comes at the urging of Kelly’s longtime collaborator Rebekah Del Rio, who sings a bilingual version of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" in Southland Tales (though she may be better known from David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive). Del Rio brought Kelly to independent cinemas like the historic Hollywood Theater, reconnecting him with film fans. “I love these old theaters,” Kelly says. “I’m so grateful … because I feel like an angel gets its wings every time an old theater gets restored.” On tour he says, “there's been a lot of talk of revisiting my first two films,” and with time, they may have grown more resonant. Southland Tales in particular has been described as a dispatch from the future. (One line from the film — also in Kelly’s Twitter bio — is “Scientists are saying the future will be far more futuristic than they originally predicted.”) Kelly speculates that “with each passing year, it just seems like the craziness knob got turned a little faster since we made the film … the world kind of caught up to the film.” The 2016 presidential election in particular represented “a moment of a seismic shift, one of many seismic shifts,” Kelly says. The reappraisal and renewed interest is gratifying for Kelly, who says gives him an \"increased sense of commitment wanting to expand upon the film.\" “These screenings are more than anything for me kind of a mechanism to try and achieve that,\" he adds. As for future projects? Kelly, as his fans know, is a devotee of classic literature (see if you catch the T.S. Eliot and Andy Warhol references), and, here, the famous Mark Twain aphorism comes to mind: Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated. Kelly stays “writing and writing and writing.” “I'm one of those people that likes to keep forging ahead, hoping that one day the floodgates will finally open and I'll be in a river flowing finally in the direction I want to go,” he says. “To make a water metaphor out of it,” he adds with a laugh.Fluid Karma Double Feature with director Richard Kelly. 5 p.m. Sat., Oct. 21.

Bimbo wave to guests during Fall Fantasy 2023. If you’ve been to Kennywood this season, you might have noticed some new larger-than-life characters around the park. As part of its 125th anniversary, Kennywood brought two mascots out of retirement: Jeeters, a fluffy pink creature in a green bandana and Grapes of Wrath esque hat, and Colonel Bimbo Fraudwater, a mustachioed clown-man wearing a blue hat and most of a striped barbershop quartet suit. The pair of mascots first returned in person last August as part of Kennywood’s annual Fall Fantasy Parades and have since appeared in signs and art throughout the park. Jeeters has even helmed his own bar, Jeeters’ Pub, opened in April and billed as “a hometown bar” that is “themed” to the “popular pink mascot from the 1970s.” Not having heard of Jeeters or his genteel friend from 50 years ago — or almost any of Kennywood's mascots of yore aside from Kenny Kangaroo — I had to know more. With a lot of help from Heinz History Center, who maintains Kennywood’s extensive archives, Pittsburgh City Paper attempts to index Kennywood mascots past and present. Austin Jeeters (aka Geeter or Geeters), ca. 1975-1990s, 2023-? Along with his companion Colonel Bimbo, Austin Jeeters began life inauspiciously, picked as a generic option out of a mascot catalogue in the 1970s. A throwback social media post from Kennywood last March, months before Jeeters’ resurrection, sheds light on his origins, and even suggests the park itself was wrapping its head around his reappearance. “He’s BIG, SCARY and PINK!” Kennywood wrote. “Okay, maybe not all that big and scary, but Jeeters is definitely pink!” Archival photos show Jeeters generally wandering around Kennywood, waving, patting kids on the shoulder, and striking up conversations. click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center \"Jeeter\" at Kennywood, 1976 A Pittsburgh Press article from 1981 also provides a rare look behind the scenes at the mostly teenaged Kennywood employees who portrayed mascots including Jeeters, described as “fuzzy pink hillbilly [who] wears patch yellow overalls and a green Keystone Cops hat.” Apparently, back then mischief abounded, with children at Kennywood trying to prank, chase, and “bedevil” the mascots. According to Kennywood's throwback post, ultimately “random pink guy” Jeeters, along with the “infamous” Col. Bimbo, simply didn’t “resonate” with parkgoers as much as “the cute kangaroo.” Both mascots were placed in “semi-retirement” sometime in the 1990s, still making the occasional appearance, including at the Fall Fantasy Parade for Kennywood’s centennial in 1998. click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center Jeeters and Col. Bimbo at Fall Fantasy, “100 Years of Kennywood on Parade,” Aug. 1998 However, some Kennywood fans remember Jeeters and Bimbo from the park’s mural art and its height requirement signs for rides, giving both mascots an air of nostalgia. Tasha Pokrzywa, Kennywood’s communications manager, tells City Paper that, decades on, “it’s funny that [Jeeters] has become such a unique and original thing” given his generic origins. The decision to bring back Jeeters was tied to ongoing park improvements, and Jeeters’ Pub is part of an array of updates and new dining options intended to blend the old and new. The pub features Kennywood’s signature 50-year-old Potato Patch fries — also honored with a bumper car ride debuted this season — and new draft beers through a partnership with Penn Brewery, the oldest in Pittsburgh. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Kennywood Height signs inside Jeeters' Pub. Jeeters was chosen as spokes-mascot, says Pokrzywa, because he fit “this whole idea of [a] Pittsburgh steel mill blue-collar little bar in the park.” “Nothing really shows [Kennywood’s] quirky and playful past more than a large pink, fuzzy guy in overalls and no shirt,” she laughs. Despite making a scary impression previously, Pokrzywa believes Jeeters is now entering a softer era. “All in all, he’s big and pink and fuzzy-looking, and I think that he’ll come across as huggable and lovable,” she says. Colonel Bimbo Fraudwater, ca. 1975-1990s, 2023-? click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center Col. Bimbo from “Kenny and Friends” A bowtie-wearing dandy of questionable military association, Colonel Bimbo Fraudwater has already lived quite a life as an entertainer at Kennywood. Archived photos and newsletters show he was previously a singer, perhaps accounting for the barbershop quartet outfit. A 1975 Post-Gazette article places him in a Sunday entertainment line-up alongside magic act Lodini and his “Calvacade of Magic,” with Bimbo’s act adding something “for the youngsters” to the bill. A team player, Bimbo seems to enjoy appearing with his fellow mascots, tipping his hat to visitors and occasionally joining them on park rides. A much-shared photo circa the late ’70s or early ’80s show Bimbo digging for a needle in a literal haystack with Kenny Kangaroo as part of a Pepsi promotion. At last year’s Fall Fantasy Parade, he rode on the Jack Rabbit float with Jeeters, and may soon do the same at the annual event next month. click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center Kenny Kangaroo and Colonel Bimbo during Pepsi promotion, ca. 1975-1985 Though he might not relive his crooner days, “I would like to see Bimbo make an actual comeback as well,” Pokrzywa tells CP. “I think that that would be really fun and interesting.” Cookie Eater or Purple Monster and Yellow Bird or Giant Bird, ca. 1970s-1980s click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center Cookie Eater click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Kennywood Kenny appears in front of the Space Odyssey with Col. Bimbo, Jeeters, and the short-lived \"Blue Monster\" A look back at Kennywood mascots quickly reveals a time with looser intellectual property laws, with many appearances by a blue, fuzzy cookie-eating chef and a large yellow bird. In the same Pittsburgh Press story featuring Jeeters and Bimbo, the “Muppet-like” characters also traipse through the park. Pokrzywa points out that Kennywood was family-owned then and “it probably wasn't as big of a deal at the time to just kind of take a famous character and kind of replicate it for your park … I'm sure that was probably happening everywhere.” click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center \"Big Bird and Jeeter,\" ca. 1976 Parker the Arrow, ca. 2015-present CP has previously recognized Parker as one of Pittsburgh’s oddest mascots, ranking among Pennsylvania Lottery mascot Gus the groundhog and the giant pierogis who run the Great Pierogi Race. Parker is a yellow fuzzy arrow “shaped like the park's iconic road signs, but, honestly, who thinks about cuddling up with a road sign?” CP wrote. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Kennywood Kenny Kangaroo, Parker the Arrow, Col. Bimbo, and Jeeters Nonetheless, Parker has appeared at Kennywood for at least a decade, even showing up to support Jeeters’ and Bimbo’s recent big debut. Mr. Fanatic, (aka Patrick “The Kennywood Fanatic” Fisher of McKeesport), 2015-2017 Ongoing research is needed into the story of Mr. Fanatic, who Pokrzywa confirmed was “short-lived” as a Kennywood mascot. As far as I can tell, Fanatic was a generic screaming Kennywood fan — shown maniacally yelling at park guests and other mascots alike — with a black-and-yellow mohawk and face paint. He was introduced in 2015 to promote the Kennywood Fanatic Club, rode the Jack Rabbit, and had his own Twitter account, before disappearing or retiring in 2017. Kenny Kangaroo, 1974-present click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Kennywood Jeeters makes an appearance with Kenny in 2005. This brings us to the unofficial mayor of Kennywood, the beloved Kenny Kangaroo. Introduced in 1974, Kenny is celebrating his 50th birthday this season with events including weekend dance parties. Though Kenny is associated with the park’s Kangaroo Ride, first opened 1962, Pokrzywa says, “in a lot of ways Kenny represents Kennywood… it's just all kind of tied together with this image of him.” Though kids love to hug Kenny and flock to his “stuffed animal presence,” Pokrzywa notes that in her experience adults react just as emotionally, and she’s always inviting the kangaroo to events. Looking through archival photos, it’s fun to see Kenny in his ’70s era, where he seems more ethereal, suggesting that he changes with the times. click to enlarge Photo: Kennywood Park Records, 1895-2018, MSS 141, Detre Library and Archives, Senator John Heinz History Center Kenny Kangaroo, ca. 1970s “I think that Kenny is going to be around for the long haul,” Pokrzywa tells CP. “And one of the greatest things is seeing these [multiple] generations visiting the park and experiencing it with their grandchildren as they experienced it as a child themselves … That’s what all these things are all about, like Jeeters’ Pub, Potato Patch, whatever it might be. It's just another way that we're bringing some of our past into today … and keeping Kennywood the playful place that it's always been.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, Kennywood, Jeeters, Colonel Bimbo, Kenny Kangaroo, Parker the Arrow Related Content Your Halloween to-do list in Pittsburgh By CP Staff Oct 24, 2024 ‌The big, spooky Pittsburgh event guide: Oct. 3-Oct. 31 By CP Staff Oct 2, 2024 The big Pittsburgh summer events guide By CP Staff Jun 19, 2024 Cosmic cocktails, beer Olympics, Kennywood charcuterie, and more Pittsburgh food news By Rachel Wilkinson Apr 9, 2024 Latest in Arts + Entertainment Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 From three rivers to 412, count the ways numerology is significant to Pittsburgh By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 6, 2025 Punxsutawney Phil fans line up at Wigle Whiskey to meet their \"god\" at Phil-a-Palooza By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 24, 2025 Before Stormy Daniels, there was Canned Peaches By David S.

On Sat., Sept. 29, at 10:30 p.m. Chbosky himself hosts a special screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (with shadow cast) at the Hollywood Theater, Dormont ($5-7; 412-563-0368). Adapting his own YA novel to the screen, Stephen Chbosky proves an understated director, allowing his cherished 1999 source to wander in many awkward directions. If Pittsburgh native Chbosky means to mirror in form the erratic moods of adolescence, he's successful, but it doesn't create a cohesive movie. High school freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a blank slate upon whom a troupe of theatrical secondary characters projects depth, including Ezra Miller's scene-stealing gay classmate and Emma Watson's bad-girl-gone-good. Charlie passively accepts from them any substance, sexual advance or paperback from the Western canon of troubled youth — Salinger, Kerouac, etc. — initiations that magically transform Charlie's suburban Pittsburgh life until driving over the Fort Pitt Bridge becomes the definitive experience. (The film was shot here, too.) But earnest platitudes (\"I feel infinite\"), vague affirmations (\"Let's be psychos together\"), and an overly naive voiceover are better suited as teen scribblings than onscreen speech. The tone also shifts temperamentally, and characters are inconsistent. Charlie's stoned request for a milkshake draws snickers until a friend's suicide is blurted out. A clownish hippie abruptly turns violent, and a hardboiled punk becomes a stage-five clinger. Moreover, the film's disturbing twist is jarring enough to make you break out.

Composed of 15 large-scale prints, the exhibition revisits the two-volume Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War, first published in 1866. The original publication, which sought to present an impartial account of the war, largely excluded or minimized the presence of Black people, enslaved, freed, or free-born, within its visual record. The touring presentation of this exhibition is organized by The Museum Box and curated by Lisa Hayes Williams, Associate Curator at the New Britain Museum of American Art, where the show debuted in 2020. Dawn Brean, The Frick's chief curator and director of collections, tells Pittsburgh City Paper that the museum began planning the exhibition several years ago, yet its resonance has only deepened in light of current political efforts to suppress Black histories. “In many ways, Kara Walker’s work feels even more urgent today than when we first booked the show,” Brean says. “It’s particularly special to show this series during its 20th anniversary, reemphasizing how Walker’s work continues to speak to where we are in the present moment as much as where we were in the past.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) The original Harper’s anthology condensed four years of weekly issues into what it claimed was a comprehensive, objective history. Yet the visual record predominantly depicted white soldiers, generals, and political figures, recasting the war as a struggle over states’ rights and economic dominance between white men. By obscuring, redirecting, and re-inscribing these scenes, Walker’s silhouettes challenge the notion of historical objectivity. Brean says, \"It’s an act scholar Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw has termed 'remembering the disremembered.’” The exhibition layout at The Frick furthers this dialogue between the original woodcuts and Walker’s annotations. Instead of presenting the works sequentially, curators intersperse Walker’s prints with original engravings by Winslow Homer, one of several “artist-reporters” who illustrated for Harper’s during the Civil War. This arrangement highlights how even the period’s most lauded visual chroniclers shaped public memory through omission and invention. “Homer’s illustrations were not wholly factual depictions of what was actually happening,” Brean explains. “His works are as much a concoction as the ‘annotations’ Walker inserts into the historic prints. Seen together, Homer’s and Walker’s prints offer opportunities to see the parallels between the two bodies of work as a witness to American history.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) at The Frick Art Museum What makes The Frick’s presentation particularly distinctive is the inclusion of bound Civil War-era copies of Harper’s Weekly owned by the Frick family. “These original editions, typically housed in the library at Clayton, are presented alongside Walker’s work, inviting further dialogue between historical and contemporary perspectives,” Brean says. Walker’s imagery is often challenging and provocative, confronting the intersections of race, gender, violence, and memory with unflinching clarity. Some prints feature scenes of sexual violence or grotesque caricatures, reflecting the brutal realities of slavery that were sanitized or excluded from historical accounts. The Frick has included a content warning to prepare visitors for the emotional weight of the works. The decision to do so acknowledges the discomfort Walker’s art can provoke, and is an invitation to reckon with the various forms of trauma and violence that continue to shape American society. The museum has partnered with over a dozen local artists, scholars, and cultural leaders to contribute guest labels, offering personal reflections on Walker’s work and its relationship to the region’s history. (Full disclosure: the author contributed a guest label to the exhibition.) This collaborative approach broadens the interpretive lens, moving beyond the institution’s voice to foster a more polyphonic dialogue. Brean says the guest labelists’ reflections are often “thought-provoking, personal, compelling, and a call to action.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) at The Frick Art Museum Among the voices included are Black women artists and writers whose work addresses the ongoing erasure of Black histories in Pittsburgh. The city’s East End, where the Frick family amassed its wealth during the Gilded Age, remains a site of contested memory, as gentrification and displacement continue to impact Black communities. “Having local perspectives woven into the exhibition deepens the connection between Walker’s work and the lived experiences of Black Pittsburghers,” Brean says. “These contributions reveal how the exhibition resonates not just on a national scale but within the fabric of the city itself.” The exhibition ends with a reflection space where visitors are invited to respond to Walker’s work and consider what questions she raises. The Frick has also curated a selection of books that explore the exhibition’s themes, encouraging deeper engagement with the historical and contemporary implications of Walker’s practice. Visitors can also submit their own reflections, some of which will become part of the exhibition’s evolving dialogue. The Frick’s presentation of Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) is part of a broader institutional effort to interrogate historical narratives through a contemporary lens. This initiative is most visible in the museum’s reinterpreted tour of Clayton, the Frick family’s Gilded Age home, which explores the inequalities and power structures that shaped the era. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Signs promoting Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) outside of The Frick Art Museum By bringing Walker’s work into conversation with these histories, the exhibition confronts the gaps and silences of the past, and invites audiences to consider how those omissions continue to shape the present. In a political climate where Black histories are under renewed threat, Walker’s work offers a counterpoint to erasure. Her silhouettes are an insistence, and a reminder that the stories of those rendered invisible by the official record demand to be seen. As visitors move through the galleries, they are compelled to reckon with the ways history is constructed, contested, and ultimately reimagined, making visible the lives and acts of violence the original illustrations sought to erase. Brean highlights one of Walker’s quotes featured in the space: “The illusion is that most of my work is simply about past events, a point in history and nothing else.” “If visitors read nothing else, I hope they read that,” Brean says.Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated).

The museum invited Pittsburgh City Paper and other local media to check out the refreshed Gilded, Not Golden tour — what we found was a thoughtful, entertaining, and more inclusive version of the walkthrough that pulled back the curtain on the Fricks’ home life while incorporating more of Clayton's staff and working-class Pittsburghers outside its walls. Our staff sat down afterward to discuss the tour and its highlights. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Rachel Wilkinson, staff writer: They really wanted to update the tour to have “a broad focus on the experiences of everyday Pittsburghers.” It's a really good effort to show the contrasts, and obviously they won an award for it, and they took several years to update it. But is it possible to encapsulate the lives of everyday Pittsburgh at one of the most opulent mansions in the nation at the time? It's difficult. Colin Williams, news editor: I think that they do a good job of acknowledging what people who were working under Frick would have been like, what their lives would have been like. But it's so crazy — there's as much stuff in just that massive dining room as there would have been in a multifamily home in Pittsburgh at that time. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The dining room at Clayton Rachel: I never considered what Point Breeze meant until the tour. I knew it was a suburb, obviously; but not that it literally referred to the idea that the breeze would run through that neighborhood [and flush out air pollution]. Colin: I thought it was really interesting that they renamed it “Point Breeze” from Homewood, that the Homewood cemetery retains the old name of what's now Point Breeze, but today when you think of Homewood, you think of a predominantly Black, working class, dense urban neighborhood. That use of branding changing as a neighborhood changes has some modern parallels. What about the many details of the house? What were some of the things you saw that left you intrigued? Rachel: The lunch pail. (Clayton added a variety of artifacts to attest to the lives of working-class Pittsburghers.) Our tour guide [Julie Silverman] said, “I like when people come in and go, ‘oh, my grandfather had that [lunch pail] that he took to the mines.’ And you go, ‘oh, there's history right here.’” It does very much echo through the generations to today, those little touches. This is not as pertinent, but I really nerded out to the ice stuff, because I love old ice hauling. When [our guide said] “there was someone whose job it was just to move around the ice,” because if you leave ice long enough in any kind of contained place, it will mold — the ice handler being one of the staff felt really opulent to me. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Adelaide Frick's bedroom Colin: Kind of on the opposite end of the temperature spectrum from that, I thought that the sitz bath was really unusual. There were so many things about it that are designed to be used with help, like you can't get in and out on your own. There are all these different valves, and you have to remember exactly which spigot they operate depending on what exactly it is you're trying to do. Going from a room where there's a rusty lunch pail to a room where there’s a brass-knobbed sitz bath, it's a very clear exercise in contrasts. There are so many amazing details in that house, everything from the crushed velvet wallpaper with mother of pearl to all the hand-carved woodwork everywhere. Whatever you can say about Clayton and Frick, almost everything in that house was in very good taste. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Parlor at Clayton, the Frick family mansion What about family members? This isn't actually exactly a family member, but one thing that I thought was a really revealing part of the tour was talking about their live-in nurse, and the photos of her with [the Fricks’] dead child, [Henry Clay Frick, Jr.] were really striking. (The Fricks’ longtime nurse Jane Grandison, who was a Black Hill District resident, gets more attention on the updated tour.) Rachel: They've updated their website, and she has her own webpage … but there is, other than that, almost no historical record of her I could find. So it seems like they really dug deep to represent her when they updated the tour, and I can see why. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Bandages and medical supplies that would have been used after the 1892 assassination attempt against Henry Frick I first got to know Helen Frick through the Frick Fine Arts Building (at the University of Pittsburgh). My understanding is that to this day, it’s a fight with her estate to the level of, like, if they change the letterhead in the building, it has to be approved. I always heard Helen was a known weirdo, with a sort of an Ivanka Trump-esque relationship to her father, and the tour was very pro Helen, I think, because she was the one who poured a lot of effort into maintaining the legacy and maintaining the estate. [But] I still remember it was a point of contention allowing anyone but traditional Western European artists to show their work in the Fine Arts building into the 21st century because of Helen Frick's estate, which complicates her legacy for me to say the least. Colin: It shows the way that she was her father's daughter, too, that there were so many really specific considerations made when it came to the appointing of the house and the way things were installed, the way that the rooms flowed into one another, even, like that little kids’ foyer with the sink in it. Rachel: That she lived until 1984 is wild. To have seen the absolute height of the Gilded Age, and then see basically the dissolution of the factories in one lifetime — I mean, I see why she had trouble adapting. Another single object I liked was the grandfather clock, because I recently learned about how weird the Allegheny Observatory is. It's where time zones were invented and standardized because of industrialization because they needed the trains and the factories to run on time. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kristin Garbarino and Bella Hanley of The Frick Pittsburgh stand in Adelaide Frick's bedroom during a tour of Clayton. Colin: The fact that this whole house is built on this foundation of steel and stuff like that, having that [clock] be so front and center was so telling. I also love that when the Fricks got it in there via their private train, it didn't quite match the woodwork! There’s sort of a poetic justice in that. Also that Orchestrion, my god. I loved hearing it play. I heard the story of the Orchestrion through a live recording of The Dollop history podcast at the Carnegie Library Lecture Hall, where they were talking about the Homestead strike and Henry Clay Frick's relationship with Carnegie at that time. Those two were literally, from what I understand, at least, corresponding about how great the Orchestrion was while they were sending in the Pinkertons [to break the 1892 strike]. Sending telegrams about this gigantic, million-dollar jukebox, basically, while you're preparing to lock your workers out of their livelihood and send in violent thugs to break up their labor movement, is really something. You couldn't draw a clearer contrast between opulence and the everyday working man’s struggle than that. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Frick's Orchestrion cost $5,000 in 1892, approximately eight years of wages for a steel worker. Rachel: Steel touched everyone for generations. To situate [the tour] in the middle of that time — in 1892 when the mansion was the most occupied — and tie it to the strike, which is probably the most significant historical event that's happened in Pittsburgh, I think it's very smart. This keeps coming up as I go to places: is this for tourists, or is this for locals? And I do feel like [Clayton] was for tourists … and now it might be for locals who have a grandfather with a lunch pail but have never been on the tour, or who have grown up around the mansion but not necessarily gone inside. I feel like that angle is more incorporated now. It's beautifully preserved, and it transports you back to that time in a way that it's hard to get elsewhere in the city. Correction: An earlier version of the article referred to Jane Grandison as a live-in maid. Grandison was actually employed as a specialized nurse. The error has been corrected.

Not having to deal with meat market dudes, who mostly lurked at South Side clubs waiting to pounce on drunk women, was a bonus. As my Pittsburgh clubbing days progressed, I realized that maybe I wasn’t as straight as I thought. Maybe, I went to these parties at Cattivo, Brillobox, Hot Mass, and other places because I was, in fact, queer, and not just an appreciator of fine house music and mesh tops. I officially came out several years ago at — where else? — a dance party. Brew House Arts explores this intersection of nightlife and queerness with a new exhibition demonstrating how underground clubs, strip joints, and discos allowed folks across the spectrum to live as their true selves, even if it was in the shadows. It also shows how they persist as safe spaces in a time when LGBTQ culture has become defiantly more visible and, as a result, politicized. During a well-attended opening on Jan. 23, DJs, including contributing artists Mary “Mary Mack” Tremonte and Jules “Malzof” Malice, pumped music for a crowd eyeing the many works showcased in When the Lights Come On: Queer Nightlife as Emergent Space. Dancers from True T, a Black-led LGBTQ arts organization in Pittsburgh, paid tribute to ballroom culture by voguing, dipping, and duckwalking to the delight of onlookers. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz True T dancers at the opening of When the Lights Come On: Queer Nightlife as Emergent Space Curated by Hannah Turpin — who organized other queer-centric shows at Brew House, including The Self, Realized: Queering the Art of Self-Portraiture in 2018 — When the Lights Come On features photography, sketches, painting, and other works depicting queer nightlife and dance culture in Pittsburgh and beyond. Above hang kaleidoscopic banners by Malice that sparkle with light from an unseen disco ball or laser light display, subtly adding a club-like vibe to the space. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz \"Peter\" by Clint Fisher Clint Fisher pays tribute to the city’s familiar haunts with three canvases dedicated to Lucky’s, a local bar, club, and gay strip joint where stockinged male dancers bump and grind for patrons. Fisher subverts the casually sexual nature of his subject with a style falling somewhere between the serene beauty of Édouard Manet and the exciting business of Romare Beardon — think “Music in the Tuileries” if there were swinging dicks and bare asses instead of ladies with parasols. It's no surprise that Harrison Apple, who co-founded the Pittsburgh Queer History Project, described as an “initiative focused on after-hours nightclubs and working-class LGBTQ lives in Pittsburgh,” would appear here. They do their work justice with “Playback is Endurance”, a nostalgic installation mimicking a workbench built to preserve 1990s-era VHS tapes from ZTV Music On Sight, a Seattle-based subscription service for professional disc jockeys. An old TV loops the videos, and, complete with tracking lines and static, offers an analog look at some of the acts made popular by queer nightlife culture, including the now ultra-famous RuPaul and the Euro-disco duo Sparks. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz “Playback is Endurance\" by Harrison Apple It’s safe to assume that Apple’s charming multimedia work also winks at poppers, a popular gay club drug made from VCR head cleaner. The show addresses this aspect more explicitly with “RUSH”, a large papier-mâché sculpture of a popular popper brand in the scene since the 1970s. Embroidery by French artist Théo Bignon and glossy prints by ggggrimes, a self-described “Black non-binary digital artist” from the Bronx, appear throughout the gallery, pulling viewers into different visions of queer nightlife. Bignon, with a combination of thread, sequins, and beads, captures the stairwells, doors, and alcoves that transport revelers to their safe spaces, the shinier elements hinting at fun times ahead. Alternately, ggggrimes lays everything out in the open with works like “Hookup”, a graphic novel-esque portrait of queer sexual desire, the subject gazing directly at the viewer as someone out of frame cops a feel under their shirt. In some respects, Bignon and ggggrimes occupy two perspectives: the necessary secrecy of queer past versus a new generation made more defiant by politicians and conservative groups that would see the LGBTQ community forced out of the mainstream and back into darkness. click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz “Hookup\" by ggggrimes Jimmy Wright stands out with Club 82, a series of sketches described as capturing the titular New York City club that, in the 1970s, served as a haven for drag queens, glam rockers, and queer people in general. Local photographer and DJ sarah huny young brings viewers back to the present day with vibrant images of Honcho, an annual camping weekend full of music, dancing, and diverse LGBTQ expression. Rounding out the artists is Nica Ross, whose video work “Eyeball Palace” pays tribute to the essential act of seeing and being seen in clubs, and Amanda Pickler, whose painting lovingly highlights lesbian bar culture. A show like this wouldn’t be complete without a disco ball, supplied here by Janie Stamm, who also produced the fetish-focused “Harness Flag” that hangs proudly in the middle of the gallery. But it’s “Queer Danceparty Promo”, a collage by Tremonte, that struck a chord. The various flyers contained here, all messily layered like they were stapled on a college campus message board, harken back to events I have either attended (the Sapphic Pamplemousse dance party) or covered (The Queer Ecology Hanky Project). click to enlarge CP Photo: Amanda Waltz “Queer Danceparty Promo\" by Mary Tremonte While I still feel like an outsider in the LGBTQ community, given my late-life coming out, Tremonte’s many playfully illustrated flyers remind me of my active participation, and that I may never have realized my identity if not for the queer events organized by her and others. It inspired gratitude for the work being done, and the work done by those before, all to create a community defined by acceptance, love, and club bangers.

Though the food tasted great, she says, and the neighborhood restaurant was “a sweet little community,” its white-walled interior struck Lillis as plain and “cut and dry.” “I was like, where are the design restaurants that New York is full of?” she says. Soon after, the couple visited Pittsburgh mainstays like Mineo’s Pizza and the former Kazansky’s Deli in Squirrel Hill, appreciating how inviting they were. “There were these really charming, longstanding [restaurants] that [were also] really cool spaces, visually,” Lillis tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “And so they just captured my eye.” click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Brillobox from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry A writer, bookseller, and photographer since the 1980s, Lillis started taking pictures. What began as quick snaps of her boyfriend across restaurant tables evolved into “sneak[ing] art shots in off moments” over nearly 20 years. Lillis’ latest book, Pittsburgh When I’m Hungry, collects photographs she shot at Pittsburgh restaurants from 2006 to 2024. Released in September, the self-published photography book features 67 full-color, full-page photos of classic Pittsburgh restaurants. Described in a press release as “an ode to charming restaurants of Pittsburgh past and present,” the book captures eateries “from diners to tablecloth establishments, from pizza joints to Lenten fish fry, from yinzer dives to ethnic eats.” click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Chinatown Inn from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry Restaurants depicted include since-closed favorites like Tom’s Diner in the South Side and Kopec’s in Lawrenceville, revived spaces like Lombardozzi’s in Bloomfield (now Fet-Fisk) and Brillobox, and decades-old institutions like Klavon’s Ice Cream Parlor and Downtown’s Chinatown Inn. Of the establishments featured, about 25 remain open, while at least 17 have closed, giving the book an air of nostalgia and a look into earlier eras of Pittsburgh’s food scene. click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Beehive Coffeehouse from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry Lillis’ favorites photos are of the Beehive Coffeehouse, which closed in 2019. Beloved by Gen X Pittsburghers, the South Side coffee shop felt like “walking into the ‘90s and having the echoes of the pre-Wi-Fi experience in a cafe,” Lillis says. Particularly evocative for her is a shot of a tea kettle being placed on one of the Beehive's famously retro tables. click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Original Oyster House from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry The idea for a photography book came after Lillis launched a postcard series at the first annual Pittsburgh Art Book Fair in 2023. Her first postcard of the Original Oyster House — Pittsburgh’s oldest restaurant — “stood out to people,” Lillis says, showing the oyster bar’s old-school heart-back chairs and a red radiator. The book debuted at the Art Book Fair the following year. Lillis says the photos in Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry intentionally emphasize local restaurants' interiors and signage, directing the viewer to look at what she calls “the architecture of hospitality.” click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Prince of India Restaurant from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry “That’s what drew me to the [restaurants] I took pictures of, is 'this feels like a space that I'm invited into,'” Lillis tells City Paper. “This feels like I want to be here, I want to spend time here. [These places] intentionally did that. There’s these little condiments on the table, and I love booths, and I just love good design.” In contemplating what makes architecture hospitable, Pittsburgh’s changing urban landscape and gentrification were also top of mind as Lillis put the book together. \"The beauty of New York when I lived there was always the mom-and-pop shops everywhere. And so I was delighted to have that here,\" Lillis says. \"Every time an older restaurant closes and another mini-mall comes with [restaurant] chains, [I think], that’s not the beauty of Pittsburgh. To me, visually, there's just no contest.\" click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Italian Village from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry Further inspiration for Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry came after the pandemic brought a wave of restaurant closures, making Lillis appreciate them that much more. In the years since Pittsburgh restaurants have reopened, she questions if the industry has fully recovered. Lillis — who manages Caliban Book Shop and operates its permanent pop-up, Karen's Book Row — has noticed a quieter Craig St., home to classic Pittsburgh restaurants like 50-year-old Ali Baba, that once saw a bustling \"worker lunch hour block.\" “It was just so convivial, the world before the pandemic,” Lillis says. “And then just to have it so emptied out — it was just like the memory was always there to me. When is that going to come back? Is it going to come back?” click to enlarge Photo: Karen Lillis Riggs Lounge from Pittsburgh When I'm Hungry Though few people appear in Lillis’ Pittsburgh restaurant photos, they nonetheless commemorate a pre-pandemic era. \"Definitely my motivation to to publish a love letter to Pittsburgh restaurants was the hospitality that I've been seeking,\" Lillis tells CP. \"What I see when I look at the[se] pictures is this warm vitality of [Pittsburgh's] restaurant spaces. The way that they arrange things for the customer and make them want to be there.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Visual Art, Karen Lillis, Karen's Book Row, Beehive, Original Oyster House, Kazansky’s Related Content A Pittsburgh volcano is dormant on Carson Street ... but not dead By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 29, 2024 Pizzeria Davide opens a new location, fish fry season begins, and more Pittsburgh food news By Hannah Lynn Feb 16, 2021 Latest in Visual Art A whitewashed Civil War text receives a much-needed revision by artist Kara Walker By Tara Fay Coleman Mar 6, 2025 When the Lights Come On brings queer nightlife out of the dark By Amanda Waltz Jan 27, 2025 New York gallerists are moving to Pittsburgh, but face challenges promoting local artists By Tara Fay Coleman Nov 21, 2024 Play isn't just for kids at the latest Children's Museum of Pittsburgh art exhibition By Sean Beauford Oct 25, 2024 More » More Visual Art All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images The Wienermobile rolls through the Strip By Mars Johnson Mar 14, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Short film Baba I'm Fine is a nuanced love letter to Pittsburgh and immigrant fathers By Rachel Wilkinson Mar 7, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

A coffee shop? Really? Of course, we have coffee shops on every corner now, filled with people sipping quietly and pecking away unobtrusively on their laptops. But the Beehive was a different beast entirely. When they opened the first Beehive on the South Side in 1991, Scott Kramer and Steve Zumoff knew they were doing something different – there were hardly any coffee shops anywhere, and Starbucks hadn’t moved east of Chicago yet. But they also had no idea how beloved the Beehive would become, or how it would nudge at least part of the city’s culture in directions it hadn’t yet considered. “There was just this positive sense of community that existed around this spot,” notes Rullo, who is a staff writer at the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle. “Like every person I spoke to thought of this place as theirs.” Rullo’s book found a publisher, Arcadia Books, who urged him to make it a wide-angle project: Gen X Pittsburgh: The Beehive and the ‘90s Scene. The Beehive still serves as the book's constant setting, but the story dives deeper, shining a light on a slice of '90s culture and nightlife that grew up in and around the pioneering Pittsburgh coffee shop. click to enlarge Photo provided by Scott Kramer and Steve Zumoff Interior shot of Oakland Beehive Which is to say, the Beehive was more than a place to get caffeinated — it was a vibe, a town square, a catalyst for change in a fading neighborhood (and city). In addition to serving countless Gen-X kids their first “real” cups of coffee, the two Beehive locations, South Side and Oakland, also fulfilled a multitude of functions: Inclusive nightlife spot. It was all-ages, and open 24 hours. Music and performance venue(s). Early acts included acoustic folk and Rusted Root. In later years, the stage mutated into whatever weirdness seemed like fun — ramen noodle wrestling (!) and the fire-eating, inferno-tempting “Circus Apocalypse.” Bands like Guided By Voices and the Jesus Lizard played at the Oakland Beehive, and apparently, the dudes from Red Hot Chili Peppers could sit quietly with a coffee on the South Side, (relatively) unbothered by the public. Curated art gallery. It was open to artists of any kind, with any level of experience. Movie theater. The Oakland location featured art-house movies, festivals, oddities and cult hits (Kids, Dazed & Confused, etc.) Bar. The Oakland location also served booze, somehow. Weirdo haven. The Beehive had tables ready for punks, hippies, goths, nerds, and every other eccentric subculture under the sun. Destination. No matter the night, the Beehive was a reason to go to the South Side, or a reason to hang out in Oakland. Pioneering pinball parlor. Did the unexpected revival of pinball (now everywhere) start at the Beehive? Rullo makes the case. click to enlarge Photo provided by Scott Kramer and Steve Zumoff Musicians, including Greg Felmley performing at the Beehive The South Side location even seemed to have its own internal ecosystem — 95% of which was smoke. In the ‘90s, people smoked all the time indoors. Imagine spending time at a coffee shop that included fire acts. This had unexpected consequences, even for the desserts. “I spoke with one of the original baristas who said that an important thing she learned [at the Beehive] was that cheesecake absorbs cigarette smoke,” notes Rullo. The ‘90s was a pretty intolerant time, and the threat of an ass-kicking (or worse) seemed to beckon from every sidewalk. But the Beehive was fine with otherwise-dangerous levels of eccentricity, deviance, and nerdiness. Suddenly, the “weirdos” had numbers. In one of Rullo’s best stories, a regular with a genetic disorder was getting bullied by a newcomer, who sneered “They let [r-word]s in here?” A Beehive patron told him off. When he replied, “Who’s going to back you up? Where’s your army?” everyone in the shop stood up. “We’re his army.” Gen X Pittsburgh recalls a time when jobs were scarce and being a barista at the Beehive — or even a janitor — was a pretty good gig. If your band had to go on tour, or you needed to disappear for a while, Zumoff and Kramer would usually give you some hours when you got back. In the early ‘90s, the South Side still had a strong sense of community, even before it became a nightlife destination. But, like much of post-industrial Pittsburgh, it was fading fast. “After the steel mills had closed, it left people feeling trapped,” says Rullo. “The Beehive presented some hope that the South Side would become something else.” It did. After the Beehive arrived, other places like Slacker and the Culture Shop followed. Dee’s Café went from an old-man bar to a Gen-X hangout. Suddenly, there were crowds on East Carson Street again. click to enlarge Photo provided by Scott Kramer and Steve Zumoff Mismatched furniture was the standard décor of the Beehive. If you were into the music scene, the art world or any sort of subculture in Pittsburgh that skulked in the shadows of the ‘90s, you’ll probably know some of the characters in Rullo’s book. Cynical, seen-it-all Gen-Xers probably thought nostalgia wouldn’t come looking for them, but they were wrong. Gen X Pittsburgh: The Beehive and the ‘90s Scene inadvertently poses the question: were the ‘90s a better time? Well, as someone who was there … I certainly don’t miss inhaling toxic gasses with every breath. But rent was cheap (I once paid $150/month to live on the South Side), food was cheap, everything was cheap. Maybe it was better in the sense that the city was always open and even introverts had to go out into the night to find music, movies, etc., to consume, instead of just asking our phones. And we all ended up at the Beehive more often than not. Book Launch party for “Gen X Pittsburgh: The Beehive and the ‘90s Scene”: Weds., Nov. 1, Tiki Lounge, 2003 E. Carson St., South Side.

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo: the Pittsburgh City Photographer Collection via historicpittsburgh.org The Diamond Market in 1914. The Babinger Hotel is visible in the background. The Market Women of Diamond Square is Pittsburgh writer Jan Ellen Kurth’s tale of feminism, displacement, and misogyny set in Downtown Pittsburgh. In the book, Kurth taps into events that played out more than 100 years ago and themes recognizable to many 21st century yinzers. The Market Women unfolds in 1914 and follows the story of Katie, the daughter of a defrocked smalltown pastor turned merchant in the Youghiogheny River town of Greenock. Katie’s ticket out of town is the fruit stall she buys in Pittsburgh’s Diamond Market. Kurth creates fictional characters and events that weave seamlessly through real life events and people. The now-local author is a former urban planner turned journalist from Kansas City, Mo., by way of upstate New York. She and her wife Ann Belser own Print, an East End monthly newspaper. The Market Women is her second novel. The market women in Kurth’s novel navigate a pre-Prohibition Pittsburgh dominated by corrupt politicians and moral-minded progressives. Katie’s fictional story plays out against a backdrop of historical events that include a crackdown on saloons serving women without male escorts — a real thing that could land a woman in jail and saloonkeepers stripped of their liquor licenses. Katie quickly sheds her smalltown naivete about life in the big city as she learns to negotiate for produce with dealers who profit from taking advantage of women they perceive as incapable of standing up for themselves. Through the other market women, Katie is introduced to downtown department stores, streetcars, and Pittsburgh’s nightlife. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Jan Ellen Kurth The market Women of Diamond Square book cover She also learns how to evade police sweeps in the red-light districts of the time, where blue laws limited who could serve and consume alcohol, where dancing was permitted, and unmarried women were labeled and prosecuted as prostitutes. Ester becomes one of Katie’s guides and closest friends. The pair form an intimate bond that begins at the market house and deepens in saloon backrooms where women drink and dance together. Henry Jacobs owns a saloon across from the market house. “They really did get in trouble for being a majority-women [saloon],” says Kurth. “I had heard of women infiltrating bars maybe when they shouldn't be. But there was actually a bar in Pittsburgh that was mostly women in 1913. You know, for any LGBTQ historian, it's like they would tell you that didn't exist.” Contemporary newspapers wrote a lot about the Jacobs saloon. “It was charged that Henry S. Jacobs, 25 Graeme [Street], kept a place frequented mostly by women and many of them of bad repute,” the Pittsburgh Post reported in 1914. Babinger’s Hotel and Mary Callahan’s Ramsey Hotel are other real-life places that provide settings for The Market Women. A subplot running throughout the book involves the city’s plans to demolish the aging Diamond Market and replace it with a new one. The women who rent their stalls from the city have their livelihoods tied up by politicians’ whims and corruption. The fear of displacement and economic doom looms large over the market women’s heads. The inspiration to write The Market Women hit while Kurth was doing historical research for another story. “I don't even remember what it was, and I came across accounts of the director of public safety at the time, Charles Hubbard, talking about cracking down on women in the bars, specifically the women from the public market house,” Kurth explains. Hubbard became infamous for reorganizing the Pittsburgh police department in 1914. He successfully lobbied the City Council to fire the city’s 25 detectives and create a new “Secret Service” to target vice. Hubbard’s campaign included raiding and closing movie theaters, rooming houses, and saloons. “The word on the street is that for the past two weeks, Hubbard has had the Downtown cafés under surveillance. His new secret service,” Ester tells Katie in The Market Women. The lines separating historical fact and historical fiction in The Market Women are fuzzy, but Kurth faithfully captures the spirit of a bygone Pittsburgh. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Jan Ellen Kurth Kurth found lots to work with as she went deeper into a research rabbit hole. “It seems that wherever I move, I'm always fascinated by the history of wherever I am,” says Kurth. “I can kind of walk some of the parts of Pittsburgh and kind of get a sense of where these stories took place and who the people were.” There’s nothing left but the ghosts of fictional Katie’s real Pittsburgh. Market Square replaced the Diamond Market in 1962. Though the buildings are long gone, the spirit of the saloons and lives lived on the edge continued well into the 20th century. In the 1970s, instead of the Jacobs saloon or Babinger’s Hotel, Market Square had Dante “Tex” Gill’s Maya massage parlor. Today, Market Square is poised for another makeover. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership Market Square today during Peoples Gas Holiday Market The backroom dealing and lack of transparency Kurth found in the events leading up to the Diamond Market redevelopment were familiar themes to the former urban planner. “I remember even telling Ann at one point when I was doing research on the demolition of the market house, how they had already decided they were going to tear it down and then they have public hearings,” Kurth says. Belser, she says, replied, “They still do that!” Asked why people should read The Market Women, Kurth replies, “You can go to any bookstore and find thousands of stories addressing World War II, but you're not going to find too many on 1913, 1914 Pittsburgh down in the market house.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Jan Ellen Kurth Jan Ellen Kurth Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Literary Arts, Jan Ellen Kurth Latest in Literary Arts Israel Centeno’s new noir novel is a layer cake of Venezuela, Pittsburgh, and Poe By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 26, 2025 A former Pittsburgh cop takes readers into the city’s underbelly in new memoir By David S.

In 2002, the celebrated Venezuelan author penned the thriller El Complot (The Conspiracy), in which an assassination plot stokes violence and paranoia, upends the country, and calls its foundational principles into question. As the novel went to press amidst a failed coup attempt on Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, it was viewed as an affront, resulting in Centeno and his family’s exile to Pittsburgh 15 years ago. “I refused to disappear,” he recently wrote about that time. Centeno arrived as a writer-in-residence at City of Asylum and attended English classes at Literacy Pittsburgh (formerly Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council), where he now serves as a Compass AmeriCorps member. “Every publication, no matter how symbolic, was an act of defiance. It was a way to keep moving forward, even if only by an inch, to remain alive as an author.” A decade after El Complot’s translation into English, Centeno says he’s still finding new ways to push forward and open new perspectives. In November, the award-winning writer self-published his 20th novel, and his first-ever book written in English, The Poe’s Project: Stealing Genius. Described by Centeno as three noir novelettes, the new book was “inspired by the gothic aura” of Edgar Allan Poe, and follows in the writer’s footsteps to examine “the dark corners of [his] literary legacy.” Poe’s life contains a number of mysteries, including his cause of death. “I tried to rewrite his biography,” Centeno tells Pittsburgh City Paper. Set in the turbulent 1890s — sometimes called the “reckless decade”— The Poe’s Project blends distinct historical settings, unfolding across Caracas, Venezuela, then embroiled in a civil war, New York City amidst the Spiritualism movement, Poe’s adopted hometown of Baltimore, Md., and Gilded Age Pittsburgh. At the book’s center is protagonist Clementina, the granddaughter of a Venezuelan independence general, who eventually finds herself in Homestead during the infamous 1892 steel strike. click to enlarge PHOTO: courtesy of Israel Centeno Israel Centeno's The Poe's Project Centeno says he’d long hoped to explore historical links between Pittsburgh and Venezuela, both places where steel production once boomed. “When I came here, Pittsburgh was very different. It was coming out of this experience of being almost on the brink of being broken and was in the transition [from] being a steel city,” Centeno says. “Before I even imagined myself coming here, I knew about Pittsburgh because of that, building our own steel industry [in Venezuela].” Characteristic of his approach, Centeno says the book’s structure was partially inspired by the parlor game exquisite corpse. In the game, players draw or write on a sheet of paper, fold it, then pass it to the next player who contributes without seeing what others have written. Invented by the Surrealists — and used by Argentine writer Julio Cortázar, who also wrote a Poe biography — the game is intended to encourage creativity and the process of “writing over,” inviting new interpretations, reconstructions, and affinities. In the same way, the structure of The Poe’s Project traverses seemingly disparate historical events and sees what parallels emerge. While there are some thriller conventions from his earlier books, Centeno describes The Poe’s Project as closer to “a parody of a thriller,” and instead categorizes it as a “historical mystery.” “I am now trying to revisit everything through this lens … revisiting authors and going through some mystery that needs to be solved,” Centeno says. Formerly a professor of American literature, Centeno says readers will also recognize references to other literary icons of the era, including Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Similarly, a forthcoming book project features science fiction and horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, who receives a letter from a Venezuelan man warning him against supporting aviator Charles Lindbergh (who later ran for political office) due to his Nazi sympathies. “I can touch [on] things about politics, [and] it’s not like I am doing a novel with a high content of politics, but it's part of the process,” Centeno explains. “When you revisit a time, you always take something [from] that period of time.” Centeno describes writing his first book in English in Lovecraftian terms. “I transcend my own universe,” he says. “My universe of thought is in Spanish, and I transcend it.” While Centeno has worked as a translator, and his previous works have been released in translation, he says the decision to self-publish The Poe’s Project came about due to ongoing reticence about his work among Venezuelan and other Spanish language publishers. “I’m still on a sort of blacklist,” he says. “One of the things that challenge[s] you when you are in exile is not only to lose your identity, but if you are a writer or an artist, to lose your natural audiences.” Still, literature cannot be understood as something done in isolation, Centeno says. In that spirit, he espouses the practice of “radical charity.” Half of the royalties from The Poe’s Project will be donated to The Red Door, a program at Downtown’s Saint Mary of Mercy Church (where Centeno is also a church member). Started during the Great Depression, The Red Door provides daily meals to those experiencing homelessness. Calling Pittsburgh his “second city,” at 67, Centeno says he feels it’s now time “to give something back.” He describes his shock at the “lack of compassion” toward unhoused people after living in the United States for 15 years. “They are invisible for us, and you pass through them,” he says. “If somebody comes to the United States and sees the streets full of homeless [people], it's like seeing the ugly face of the country.” “Sometimes you get lost in abstraction, how to change the whole world,” Centeno says. “But you forget that you can do something very concrete, just sending an Amazon box of soup to The Red Door or other charitable work.” That sense of community extends to his artistic practice. click to enlarge PHOTO: courtesy of Israel Centeno Israel Centeno and The Poe's Project “I love to write, and to recreate the world, and to see the world through art,” he says. “For me, it’s very important to not lose the connection.

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Sharon Liotus Brenda Tate spent more than 40 years in law enforcement: five with the Housing Authority Police and another 40 as a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer. Tate’s new memoir, Journal of a Black Woman in Blue, recounts her experiences as an alcoholic and narcotic-addicted cop on the beat. “I started off writing about being an African American policewoman,” says Tate. “I wanted to talk about my community, and when I started talking about my community, these other visions started popping in.” Tate’s community will be a familiar place to many older yinzers: bars, numbers stations, and poverty. It’s also a place where families like Tate’s struggled to raise children and make a living in a city infamous for throwing up roadblocks to Black residents, especially women. “I grew up in Pittsburgh’s historic Hill District in the 1950s and early ’60s, and I have lived here all my life,” Tate’s book begins. The book is a different take on the Hill District during the civil rights era and afterwards. Tate grew up in a home where her mother struggled to make ends meet while her father disappeared into the neighborhood’s bars and brothels, sometimes for hours, other times for days and weeks. A union worker, Tate’s father died in 1964 at age 48. He left the family with a depleted pension fund — as in empty — and pathologies that would take decades to repair. “That day was the worst day of my life,” Tate writes of his passing. After the funeral, she joined family members in a Herron Avenue bar, one of her father’s favorites, where the bartender offered the teenager a drink. “This was my first drink in a bar. I was 15 years old, and the experience would change my life forever.” click to enlarge URA photo courtesy of Pittsburgh City Archives Lou's Ringside Bar The 630 Bar was a Hill District favorite, along with Lou’s Ringside Bar and the Black Beauty Lounge on Centre Avenue. Vann’s Bar on Webster Avenue provides the setting for much of Tate’s memoir. Characters in Tate’s book, like “Mr. Jackson the Ragman,” who ran a numbers station inside his Rowley Street store, and “Cigar Annie the Wannabe Gangster,” seem too colorful to be true. Yet, Pittsburgh’s newspaper archives and criminal court records make them plausibly anonymized real-life figures. Nothing is off limits in Tate’s book. She recounts in stomach-churning detail the many episodes of sexual abuse she survived, from her mother’s male friends to her own partners. “The first male friend I remember my mother having was Mr. Gump, who lived around the corner and spoke with a strange accent,” Tate wrote in Journal. Tate’s mother would send her to the man’s apartment to borrow money. “The first time he molested me, I had no expectation that he would do anything except give me the money.” The environment followed Tate into adulthood, and she self-medicated. Alcohol, and later cocaine, took the edge off. Whether it was abusive men or the racist and misogynist cops who were her peers and supervisors, a chemical escape was never far away: bars on her beats where she could duck in for a quick drink or score some coke, and even her own Hill District home, which she once turned into a beer garden for on-duty cops. “I always left the back door open so that officers could park behind my house and have access any time to my Beer Meister,” Tate wrote in Journal. Tate, who walked a beat in the Hill District’s Zone 2, joked that her house had become known as “Zone Two and a Half.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Brenda Tate Tate wasn’t the first Pittsburgh cop to struggle with alcohol and drug abuse. But by the time she became a cop in 1979, she was in the minority of Black women in uniform. As a Black woman, she entered the force with two strikes against her. “You have to remember this was a white-male-dominated time,” says Tate. “They were used to protecting and interacting with the white male. If there was a white male with a drinking problem, they knew how to handle him. That was one of their boys.” Tate’s gender and race left her vulnerable to hazing and abuse. In the book, she recounts one episode when she was walking a beat on Mt. Washington. When she asked her sergeant for a radio, he told her there were none left. Unable to answer calls from the station, she got a three-day suspension for leaving the station without a radio. Tate took the multiple attempts to sabotage her career in stride. “People in my community respected me as a black officer … when I put my uniform on,” she says. “I kind of knew what I was and who I was, even through the haze of the alcoholism. It was something that I was raised with, being an African American woman.” After hitting rock bottom, Tate entered rehab. In recovery, she got certified as a counselor and worked with other alcoholic and addicted women police officers to get them help by founding a women’s recovery program. Tate later got assigned to the police department’s Witness Protection Program, and she was assigned to protective details for visiting dignitaries, including presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden. She also protected the Dalai Lama and Rosa Parks while they were in Pittsburgh. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Tate engages with the audience at Senior Jazz Connection on Feb. 21, 2025. Tate retired in 2014 and turned to community service. In 2022, she founded the Senior Jazz Connection. It meets at the Blakey Center and connects seniors with local jazz artists. Before that, she had organized jazz sessions at the Centre Avenue YMCA. In 2023, WQED featured Tate’s story in a short documentary, Brenda Tate: Making a Difference. Tate’s book came out in 2024. Her memoir does double duty: it’s a long apology and a vehicle to explain her complicated life to her two sons, and it’s a window into Pittsburgh Black history that’s quickly closing. “I think there's so many of us that are still alive, that are so much part of the African American history in this city, that sometimes they go unnoticed,” says Tate. “We all have a story, especially the ones 70 and over.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Literary Arts, Brenda Tate, Lou's Ringside Bar, Hill District Related Content The Hill District tower wars highlight a forgotten fight against environmental racism By David S.

For better or worse, the genre has, in recent years, adopted cover art with less explicit illustrations of fully clothed figures with featureless faces, achieving a look that’s more cute than alluring. While this new trend plays it safe, meaning that books can be displayed openly without fear of upsetting conservative shoppers or parents of young kids, it leaves Pittsburgh romance author Lainey Davis wanting. “It’s a great nipple purge,” she tells Pittsburgh City Paper, relaying how there “wasn’t a single male nipple” at a bookstore she visited in New York City. She explains that large chains like Barnes & Noble have justified the choice by saying they have “issues with getting in covers that have models.” Thankfully, Davis, who releases her books independently, can have her male nipples and publish, too. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Lainey Davis “I love a man-chest cover, but I also am in this to earn money,” she explains, adding that the ebook version of her soccer-themed Forging series features male shirtlessness while the “paperbacks are just going to have soccer balls and flowers on them.” Davis represents one of many local authors cashing in on romance fiction’s mainstream growth following the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and so-called “romantasy” series like A Court of Thorns and Roses. The boom has allowed her and others to make a career or, at least, a side hustle out of producing what fans affectionately call smut (the authors City Paper interviewed would rather not use that term). In many cases, their steamy stories are also set against the backdrop of Pittsburgh. Besides being able to make money while being fulfilled creatively, Davis and others are showing that the romance genre serves a larger purpose than turning on readers — by honestly depicting the full spectrum of the human sexual experience, centering the voices of women and the LGBTQ community, and challenging the growing, conservative-leaning censorship that, as the “great nipple purge” demonstrates, has taken hold of media. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Books by Lainey Davis click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Lainey Davis In the beginning, though, penning romance was a necessity for Davis. “I have always worked as a writer,” says Davis, who earned an MFA in creative nonfiction from the University of Pittsburgh and previously held a communications job. “I don't have any other marketable skills … And I came home one day [in 2017] and it was raining in my children's bedroom … So we needed more money to replace the roof. I was whining about this and my friend said, ‘You should publish erotica and sell it on Amazon.’ And I said, ‘Oh, I can't do that.’ And he said, ‘Why?’ And I didn't have a good answer, so I did.” What started as self-publishing to cover repair costs took off as Davis saw a desire for her stories, particularly the Pittsburgh-set Stag Brothers series. “People, I think, were hungry for feel-good fiction, and I was able to leave my day job in June of 2021,” she says. Since then, she has put out around four books, each totaling approximately 220 pages, per year. The choice, however, went against everything Davis learned in school, as genre fiction — an umbrella term under which romance, horror, and science-fiction fall — was “largely frowned upon” by her MFA peers. “I had one guy from the program who was doing well in genre fiction after graduating and … I felt people judging him,” she says. “I had carried those attitudes too about it.” Her views changed after her mother died in 2015, a loss that left Davis unable to enjoy reading. “I just couldn't access that concentration area of my brain,” she explains. “And she was a huge romance reader, and I started reading some of her old novels. I was burning through these novels and I loved how, even though I knew everything was going to work out in the end, it was also very gripping. And I just loved that experience. I needed that at that time in my life and I continue to inhale a lot of romance.” She agrees that the “bad rap” romance gets from academia could be attributed to sexism, as women writers dominate the genre. Still, rejection by the serious literary community has not impeded the genre’s popularity or success. On Jan. 30, the New York Times reported that Onyx Storm, a romantasy work by Rebecca Yarros, became the fastest-selling adult novel in two decades. The latest in the author’s Empyrean series, described as being set at a “military academy for dragon riders,” sold 2.7 million copies in its first week of release. As the article points out, Onyx Storm highlights the ever-increasing appetite for romantasy, a subgenre that “blends spicy sex scenes and romance tropes with supernatural elements” — by NYT’s number, romantasy accounted for an estimated 30 million print sales in 2024, a rise of 50% over the previous year. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Anna Zabo Anna Zabo Local author Anna Zabo is a self-described writer of “contemporary and paranormal romance for all colors of the rainbow.” Zabo tells CP they “kind of fell into writing romance sideways” while attending Seton Hill Univerrsity’s Writing Popular Fiction Masters of Fine Arts program. “I went into the program with the notion of writing fantasy and science fiction, which was what I grew up reading, and, while the program had us reading in our own genre, it also wanted everyone to have a broader understanding of popular fiction, so we read outside our specific genre, too,” they explain. Zabo decided to write a paranormal romance because they “wanted to write something different and fun.” “And I never stopped writing romance after that,” says Zabo. “I love writing relationships and characters and having people interact with each other, and romance has a ton of that.” Zabo says their writing focuses mainly on “found family” or “discovering your people, essentially, especially through falling in love.” “While all of my novels focus on a developing relationship, they're not in isolation to the friends and community around them, whether it's in an office setting, or a rock band, or a hockey team. Or even fae or shapeshifters. Sometimes people are isolated, but they're drawn into communities.” Like Zabo, other local authors are doing their part to center LGBTQ voices in a genre once reserved for heterosexual desire and relationships. Rachael Lippincott and Alyson Derrick, a Pittsburgh-based married couple who occasionally co-write novels, have found success producing young LGBTQ love stories. These include Pride and Prejudice and Pittsburgh, the NYT bestseller The Lucky List, and Five Feet Apart, adapted into a 2019 film. She and Derrick also co-authored She Gets the Girl, described in a CP review as a “bouncy young adult romantic comedy” about two teenage girls attending the University of Pittsburgh. Zabo says authors not having to rely on traditional publishing means readers can “now find romances for just about everyone in the LGBTQIA spectrum,” including “aromantic characters that are structured similarly to romances that explore queer platonic relationships.” “I think the shift came partially from being able to self-publish easily, that self-publishing is accepted as a legitimate avenue for success in the book industry, and from the advent of online places to share fanfiction,” they explain. Zabo says that, while they have been published by “small presses and imprints of large publishers,” most of their books are now self-published. Even in the relatively small Pittsburgh literary community, writers have shown that romance has grown to represent a broader, more inclusive array of identities and desires, meaning that readers can find the offbeat, wholesome, or erotic. In terms of the latter, Davis believes focusing on sex does not have to come at the expense of character-building or plot. This especially applies to “open-door romance,” or romance containing detailed sex scenes. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost “I feel like I don't have time to read a book that's not going to display the full spectrum of the human experience, and I like to feel like the sex scenes are integral to the character development,” she says. “If you just pulled the sex scenes out of my book, there would be a lot of plot development missing.” Davis believes depicting sex honestly avoids some of the pitfalls that negatively stereotype the romance genre — she never uses euphemisms such as calling a penis a “member.” She learned that this approach better serves the reader — last year, she appeared on a podcast that also featured a sexual wellness expert who revealed that, with the state of sex education in schools, a lot of teenagers are “turning to romance novels as their only source of sex education.” “And that really stuck with me,” says Davis. She adds that, while she is “not qualified in any way to provide sex education,” she finds it important to have consent and “discussions of contraceptives” on the page. “And that's been a fun challenge to make those conversations sexy. And I like to write what I call green flag heroes … The heroes in my book are having explicitly consensual intercourse.” Like Davis, Zabo says their work is “very much open-door,” and that some of their books “delve into kink/BDSM.” “I think sex can be powerful emotionally, and I like to show that,” they add. “No shade on closed-door books. There's absolutely a place and need for them, too.” Even so, Davis says readers still find aspects of her books to appreciate beyond the sexual content. “I had a reader early on write to me and say the sexiest part of my book was when my heroine spoke up at a meeting and everybody listened to her,” she says. “And that really stuck with me because I try in my books for the female characters to be successful in their career aspirations and in their interpersonal relationships, as well as their romantic pursuits.” However, as the romance industry grows, so do the pearl-clutching tactics of publishers and booksellers to impede the voices of writers in the genre. “I think there's a lot of censorship that targets pornography and obscene things, which, fuck that,” says Davis. She says online retailers like Amazon ask authors to click on a box indicating if there is “inappropriate” or mature content in a book. “And I never check it because who the hell are you to decide what is inappropriate? And as long as it's phrased that way, I'll never check it.” Davis believes aspiring romance authors should connect with those already working in the genre. Local storytellers can do this by attending events like Talking Flirty: Romance Authors Tell All, a panel featuring Davis and fellow authors Christina Bunner, Beck Grey, Kimberly Miller, Liz Milliron, and Linda Rettstatt, taking place on Sat., Feb. 15 at the Northland Public Library. Zabo believes there is no wrong way for developing romance authors to hone their craft, whether it’s producing fanfiction or original stories, taking classes, or using how-to guides on writing fiction. “As someone with two degrees in writing, you absolutely don't need a degree in writing to write,” they add. “You just need a story in your head that you want to share with someone else.” click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Talking Flirty: Romance Authors Tell All 2-3:30 p.m. Sat., Feb. 15 Northland Public Library. 300 Cumberland Rd., North Hills Free.

From daycare centers and classrooms to community hubs throughout Pittsburgh, she dedicated years to fostering young minds. However, one issue weighed heavily on her heart: Black children grappling with the acceptance of their natural hair. Too often, she would hear them refer to their curls as \"nappy,\" expressing frustration and embarrassment that echoed the negativity inherited from previous generations. Inspired by her journey of self-acceptance and a desire to instill confidence in those youths, Smith wrote My Hair Ain’t Nappy — a vibrant love letter, an affirmation of self-worth, and a playful challenge to the idea that only certain types of hair are considered good. “I knew that I wasn’t just writing this book for Black children,” Smith tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “I was also writing it to heal the inner child in me.” My Hair Ain’t Nappy tells the story of Amara, a confident young girl who loves her natural hair and embraces its versatility and uniqueness. Through Amara’s journey, Smith hopes to reshape how Black children see their hair — and themselves. Black hair has, for centuries, been at the center of societal scrutiny and discrimination. During slavery, African hairstyles were often forcibly shaved off as a way to strip enslaved people of their identity. Eurocentric beauty standards dominated, pushing the idea that straighter hair was the proper and professional way to present oneself. Smith came of age surrounded by these messages. “I grew up in an era where most people were getting relaxers and straightening their hair all the time,” she recalls. “It makes you feel like your hair has to be a certain way to be acceptable.” Looking back, Smith realized her journey to writing My Hair Ain’t Nappy wasn’t just motivated by her work with kids — it started much earlier, in high school, with her friend Amirah, the namesake of the book’s main character. “One day, she came to school with this big, beautiful Afro,” Smith says. “At the time, not a lot of people were wearing their hair like that. [Amirah] just said, ‘I’m going natural. I’m done putting relaxers in my hair.’” To teenage Smith, this was a radical statement. Amirah was boldly rejecting societal norms. And she wasn’t just changing her look — she was changing the conversation. “She told me, ‘Our hair is not nappy, and we shouldn’t use that word because it has such a negative connotation,’” Smith says. That moment stuck with her. Even as she grew older and, like many Black women, experimented with wigs and straightening her hair, Amirah’s words echoed in her mind. Black hair wasn’t something to be fixed — it was something to be celebrated. Even in modern times, Black children have been punished in schools for wearing their natural hair in styles like afros, braids, or locs. Workplace discrimination against Black hair is so prevalent that laws like the CROWN Act have been passed to protect individuals from being penalized for their natural texture. When Smith heard a young girl at the community center complain about her nappy hair, it all came full circle. Smith connected with J & I Publishing LLC, a Pittsburgh-born artist based in Atlanta, and the collaboration felt like fate. “She was a Black woman, so I felt like she would really understand my vision,” Smith explains. “We went page by page, illustration by illustration, making sure every image captured the essence of the story.” Her illustrator brought My Hair Ain’t Nappy to life visually, and helped Smith gain confidence in her writing. “She told me, ‘Your book can be whatever you want it to be.’ That meant so much to me,” Smith says. So far, the response to Smith’s creation has been overwhelmingly positive. One reviewer on Amazon wrote, “Books like this will allow young melanin girls and boys to understand the importance of hair and where it thrives from… It also educates all cultures about Black hair and influences self-love.” Another praised Smith for turning a negative stereotype into a source of empowerment, saying, “This book enables kids, especially those of African American descent, to embrace their true and unique identity.” Smith hopes her book encourages parents and educators to be more mindful of the language they use. “Sometimes we don’t realize that we’re teaching kids to dislike their own hair,” she says. “When you say things like, ‘She has good hair,’ what message are you sending to a child who doesn’t have that texture?” She also hopes to see more books like hers in schools and libraries. “We need more books that celebrate Black hair,” Smith says. “Not just for Black kids, but for everyone. The more people understand and appreciate Black hair, the closer we get to breaking down those negative stereotypes. “I think it’s important for Black people to love being Black,” she says. “We’ve been taught for so long to dislike certain things about ourselves, but we need to reprogram how we see ourselves.

In getting this dramatic cut, one I only recently learned the name of, I unintentionally became part of a natural hair movement for Black women that's been brewing since before I was born. Black hair has been appropriated and stigmatized throughout history, and it's what Emma Dabiri extensively unpacks in her new book Twisted: The Tangled History of Black Hair Culture.Maybe it's because I wasn't actively seeking information about natural Black hair. Or maybe it's because Black hair \"continues to be erased, appropriated, and stigmatized to the point of taboo,\" explains the description of Twisted. Maybe it's because I don't see Black women in the media wearing their natural locks. But until I read Twisted, I thought the hate, shame, embarrassment, and insecurity about the natural state of my hair was a problem unique to me. As it turns out, the distaste for wavy, big, Black hair that grows up and out in defiance of gravity is deeply ingrained in worldwide racism (shocker!). Black hair is unlike the hair of any other race. And as Dabiri, an Irish-Nigerian points out, \"Our hair is the physical marker that distinguishes us from all other racial groups.\" A light-skinned Black person could pass as white if they have \"good hair.\" The same person with a head of tight, \"kinky\" curls is undeniably Black. And as the Black Lives Matter movement shows, being Black has always meant being considered inferior and inadequate. Twisted is not a light read. Dabiri, a contributor to The Guardian and a prominent BBC race correspondent, weaves (pun intended) an engulfing, information-packed collection of essays about her personal hair journey, while giving \"insight into the way racism is coded in society's perception of black hair, and how it is often used as an avenue for discrimination.\" She discusses pre-colonial Africa, what exactly is \"good hair,\" the relationship between words used to discuss Black hair — always called unmanageable, frizzy, time-consuming — the criminalization of dreadlocks and \"unprofessional\" Black hair in the workplace, and every nook and cranny in between. There's so much I could say that wouldn't even scratch the surface of Dabiri's work in Twisted. Her writing is straight to the point, sharply researched, and powerfully resonant. I went into Twisted thinking, \"Cool, I will learn about the history of Black hair and be done.\" I didn't realize how much I needed to read something like this, and I came out with a deeper appreciation of what's growing from my head. I feel more confident and self-assured. I wore my hair not-in-a-bun for the first time in months. While I know there will be days where I fall into the trap of comparing myself to European beauty ideals, which I will never be able to fit into, I realized that that \"the big chop\" was just the first step in my natural hair journey. I was never taught out to properly care for my delicate hair, how to appreciate it's pliable form. Reading Twisted was the second step in my hair journey, recognizing that I live in a society designed to exclude me, and that the education of Black life and uplifting of Black bodies is only just beginning. Twisted: The Tangled History of Black Hair Culture is available now via Harper Perennial.

These Rust Belt expansions promise to reshape the local scene, bringing new perspectives and commercial opportunities while raising questions about sustainability and equity. However, the challenges of sustaining a gallery in Pittsburgh are real. Lexi Bishop opened her gallery, here, in 2021, and it serves as a recent example of both the potential and the challenges of operating a commercial art space. What started as a pop-up that then earned a permanent space in the historic Mexican War Streets, the gallery drew on Bishop’s extensive experience at prestigious institutions like Christie’s and Nino Mier Gallery in Los Angeles. The space was poised to introduce contemporary art to a broader Pittsburgh audience. Bishop announced in February the gallery’s temporary closure, citing various reasons. \"The gallery closing was less an issue about sustainability for me and more a mix between needing a break personally and a matter of location,\" Bishop tells Pittsburgh City Paper. \"My lease was up, so it seemed like a good time for a break.” While the influx of galleries from a larger city could signal a revitalization for Pittsburgh, a city with deep industrial roots and a growing creative community, it also highlights tensions around affordability, local support, and balancing artistic integrity with commercial success in a shifting market. The arrival of outside galleries offers the potential for diverse visions to strengthen the ecosystem, challenge the status quo, and enrich the community in new ways. Bishop notes that the city lacks a robust culture of art collecting compared to other major art hubs. “Only 10% of my sales each year were to people based in Pittsburgh,” she reveals. \"Pittsburgh is run by the nonprofit sector, and it seems like people have a hard time supporting 'for-profit' ventures, even though it’s those ventures that help local artists the most in the long run.\" Bishop emphasizes the role that commercial galleries play in an artist’s career. \"Commercial galleries not only sell work, which helps artists sustain a career via sales, but they also help artists get into great collections and expose their work to new markets and collectors via art fairs and press. Galleries have a very real, financial interest in gaining exposure for their artists, as well as educating the public and press about their artists outside the local sphere.\" As these New York transplants settle in, they introduce new perspectives, but the question remains whether these ventures can build sustainable models for long-term success in a city still developing its collector base and support for contemporary art. Patrick Bova and Lucas Regazzi originally operated their gallery, april april, as a project space in their Brooklyn apartment from 2021 to 2024, before relocating it to Wilkinsburg. The gallery, touted for its artist-driven curatorial approach and wide-ranging practices, brings new energy to the city’s arts scene. \"We found life and the gallery practice in New York to be unsustainable,\" they tell City Paper. It was during a visit to Pittsburgh that they first began to envision a different way forward. They had traveled to meet Paul Peng, a local artist, for a studio visit and quickly fell in love with the city, jointly stating, “The scene is robust, the city’s institutions are strong—some on the precipice of expansion and change themselves—such that it felt exciting to work towards participating in it.\" Bova and Regazzi were also drawn by the creative possibilities that Pittsburgh offered. “They’re very different!” they exclaim when comparing Pittsburgh to New York. “Pittsburgh offers more space and time for creative practice, across socio-economies. There’s a glut in New York that stymies authenticity.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Outside the april april gallery in Wilkinsburg This openness and slower pace were key in their decision to plant roots in Pittsburgh’s art community, where they now feel they have room to grow. “Showing up is important to us, and likewise building a space that welcomes community,” they say. They also feel a responsibility to engage with and learn from the scene that initially drew them to the city. “Everyone has a responsibility to the place they choose to plant roots in. For us, this means being in dialogue with and learning from the existing ecosystem in Pittsburgh.” Even though the art services infrastructure — such as shipping and framing — may not be as robust as in New York, the duo is optimistic and adaptable. “There are fewer art services here, but we’re managing so far,” they share. One central ambition for april april is to foster connections between Pittsburgh and the wider contemporary art world. “Contemporary art is a global dialogue that Pittsburgh has been a part of for decades,” they point out. “One of our greatest excitements in programming the gallery is acting as a forum for such dialogue, between Pittsburgh, the greater region, the nation, and the world.” However, navigating the commercial aspects of running a gallery in a smaller city presents unique challenges, and Pittsburgh’s market is still developing. “Building a collector base here is not dissimilar to building it elsewhere — it goes back to showing up and acting as a channel for artists you believe in,” they explain. Bova and Regazzi see their work through a lens of artist advocacy. Rather than chasing trends or high-profile artists, they focus on career development and fostering cross-generational collaboration. \"We have so far dedicated our practice to assisting in building careers rather than hopping on someone else’s tram. We also think it’s imperative to work cross-generationally and weave experiences together — this creates a stronger art history from which the market can assess.\" The journey from New York to Pittsburgh has brought with it both excitement and uncertainty, but the founders of april april are committed to the business’ continued development. “Every small business needs to be iterative and responsive to have sustainable growth,” they note. And while the idea of expansion may seem like a future goal, they’re focused on the present, saying, “Yes to collaboration, and we’ll learn through doing if expansion is tenable.” Ultimately, Bova and Regazzi see Pittsburgh as a place full of potential — one that doesn’t need New York to define its success. “Pittsburgh doesn’t need New York to do those things. The question should be who wants to participate in the project of global reputation?” they ask. They hope to help elevate Pittsburgh’s role in the global art world while finding space to grow at their own pace. “Artists should live and make work in places that inspire them and demonstrate investment in their success. No city does this perfectly, and everyone has different needs. For us, it feels like Pittsburgh can give us something that New York can’t: space to experiment and grow at our own pace.” Bishop remains optimistic about Pittsburgh’s evolving art scene, despite having to temporarily close her gallery. She wants to stay in Pittsburgh and reopen her gallery in a different location, potentially in Garfield, where she currently lives. Seeing other galleries transfer from New York to Pittsburgh also gives her hope. \"I do think a culture of collecting is expanding in Pittsburgh, and I think [spaces such as] april april moving into town will only help,\" she adds.

But this month, the neighborhood will serve as the site for a new pop-up gallery dedicated to connecting Pittsburgh to art hubs throughout the country. Lexi Bishop, a recent transplant to Pittsburgh with an extensive professional arts background, will debut here Gallery at Arsenal Motors, a renovated former auto manufacturing site located on Butler Street. The project will kick off on Sat., April 10 with the opening of Deep Blue, an exhibition showcasing the paint and drawing works of Los Angeles-based artist Molly Greene. Bishop moved to Pittsburgh with her partner in August 2020 and has since looked for opportunities to translate her experience into supporting the local art community. Her background includes serving as the associate director of the Nino Mier Gallery in L.A. and working at the prestigious New York City auction house Christie’s, where she was a specialist in the Post-War and Contemporary Art Department. While Bishop may have just settled here, she’s no stranger to Pittsburgh. She says she has visited the region multiple times over the past eight years, as her partner is a Pittsburgh native. “So I’ve really seen this city transform,” says Bishop, adding that she remembers the times before Lawrenceville experienced its big boom. With projects like here Gallery, she plans on bringing emerging outside artists to Pittsburgh and expanding the reach of talent based in the city. Bishop says she met Greene in New York while curating a group exhibition, and hopes to feature other artists from that same show. She says Greene offers an interesting perspective as someone without formal art training. Instead, Greene earned a PhD in American History from Yale University and a graduate degree in Environmental Science, which she draws on to create her eerie floral paintings that examine the complicated relationship between humans and machines, all within a feminist context. “A lot of the people I work with are my clients from New York and L.A. and I’m hoping I can introduce them to Pittsburgh artists,” says Bishop. “And that I can then get Pittsburgh artists into collections around the U.S. outside of Pittsburgh, which I think is also key to expanding their client base.” She believes the Pittsburgh art scene has “some real gems” that would thrive at a national level. Deep Blue will run through April at Arsenal Motors, a space Bishop says offers high ceilings, garage doors, and other attractive elements. Opened in July 2020, Arsenal Motors marks the latest venture from the local co-working company Beauty Shoppe, which developed the massive 30,000-square-foot, mixed-use building with Q Development and Ernie Sota of Sota Construction. While here Gallery may only be temporary, Bishop says she is already on the hunt for a permanent gallery space in the city. She also has forthcoming programming planned out, including an exhibition with London-based painter Sinead Breslin, and a group show. “I’m definitely going to set my roots down here permanently,” says Bishop, adding that tickets for the Deep Blue opening reception on Fri., April 9 have sold out. “I’m already feeling good about the future.” here Gallery presents Deep Blue.

It’s all fun and games until you grow up. In Play is Infinite, the latest exhibition at the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Chinese American artist Jordan Wong, aka WONGFACE, considers what it is to live as one might play, and how play can enhance even the things we take seriously. He weaves cultural references, pop culture references, and philosophical references to Taoism, Dualism, and Nondualism, creating art for all ages. The series of intricate, fantastical 2D works throughout the museum are layered with text, shapes, and characters, so many that you can discover something new upon each viewing, a treat if you’re a caregiver who visits the museum multiple times a year for the sake of children in your life. Play is Infinite, like much of Wong’s work, feels like it’s speaking to adults through a childlike language. “My work naturally has a sense of whimsy to it,\" Wong tells Pittsburgh City Paper. \"It is inspired by things that I fell in love with as a kid: anime, manga, comic books, graphic novels, video games, and cartoons. It just felt like a natural fit. I’m essentially a big kid. The things that I loved when I was small, I still love them as an adult.” Across three floors, the vibrant works hang on walls near or in passageways such as stairwells and hallways. Each piece features scattered arrows pointing every which way. In \"Dreamland (Tutorial Lvl.),\" a mural between the first and second floors, arrows direct the visitors' movement as they travel between levels. “Iconography and arrows are a huge part of my visual language and the arrows are a fun little reference,\" Wong says. He explains how \"Dreamland (Tutorial Lvl.),\" a white design on a bright blue background, uses video game and navigational references to direct visitors through the space. click to enlarge Photo: Kaela Speicher \"Dreamland (Tutorial Lvl.)\" by Jordan Wong The various mediums throughout Play is Infinite speak to Wong's experimental approach to artmaking. He plays with digital printing, aquatint etching, lightboxes, gold foil, vinyl, aluminum, and copper. He also invites visitors to play along with paper and crayons against a laser-engraved wood panel. “It really connects with being creative, having an art practice. It's all rooted in play, right?\" says Wong. \"You know, use of different processes, technologies, and collaborative relationships with other fabricators, artisans, and craftspeople. That sense of play is not just restricted to your proficiency in one medium or even a couple media.” While the cartoonish figures against vibrant colors invite the gaze of children, the densely layered iconography, particularly the use of retro video game imagery, makes it clear that the works are speaking, at least partially, to people old enough to understand some of the references. After all, it is adults who need to be reminded of the importance of play, who need to be ushered back to a time before play was worked out of their system. This is especially necessary in the Children’s Museum, where adults are in full grown-up mode as they watch over the kids for whom they are responsible. In a place that utilizes play as a tool for childhood development, Wong’s work further drives home the point that play is more than recreation. Wong, who grew up in Pittsburgh and lived there for 20 years before moving to Cleveland, has created mesmerizing larger-than-life outdoor installations at the New Little Free Library in Cleveland and Akron Art Museum. The wondrous works pay homage to his heritage in the act of reclamation, and his childhood influences, in the act of reimagining. Wong, who has a graphic design background, developed a distinct visual language. His works are both meticulous and exude a freestyle rhythm that allows them to move from background to foreground and back, like members of a jazz band trading subtle solos while the rest of the ensemble plays accompaniment. click to enlarge Photo: Kaela Speicher \"WONDER x WONDER\" by Jordan Wong Wong’s next Pittsburgh showing, Extended Play, opens February 2025 at Bakery Square’s Portal Art Gallery, in partnership with ZYNKA Gallery. As the title might suggest, the upcoming exhibition will complement Play is Infinite, exploring similar themes through new work. “It’s still very much in the spirit of play, of growth, of who am I, what can I really achieve, and how do I do that? What power-ups do I need? What final bosses do I need to beat, particularly within myself?\" says Wong.Play is Infinite. Continues through May 2025.

The Women’s Sports Foundation estimates that 3.4 million high school-aged girls participate in a sport in comparison to 3.6 million boys. Still, although numbers have risen in recent years, studies show that physical activity tends to decrease as girls go through puberty. Experts say this isn’t due to a lack of passion, but the lack of comfort that takes shape in the absence of sports bras. To remove an often forgotten barrier to women and girls participating in sports, the Pittsburgh Steelers, Penguins, Pirates, and Riverhounds joined together with Operation Warm and FLY:FWD to distribute sports bras to the Pittsburgh Public Schools’ Girls Flag Football team. While each team does its share of giving back to the city — whether it's supporting Juneteenth festivities, or the Pittsburgh Pride parade, or hosting a charity event for vulnerable communities — Riverhounds and Riveters Senior Director of Ticketing Nicole Rudy told Pittsburgh City Paper that the teams involved couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work together and ensure that girls could comfortably play their favorite sport. “It’s a piece of equipment that goes forgotten and the equipment that a young girl might need to feel comfortable playing that sport and a sports bra is one of those things that is very important and especially as girls get into those teenage years, it can be something that deters them from wanting to continue participating,” Rudy says. “So any opportunity we have to help encourage young females in our area to stay engaged in athletics, we're all in for helping out.” Where Operation Warm is a nonprofit dedicated to supplying children in need with coats and shoes, FLY:FWD, cofounded by the Philadelphia Eagles, ensures that girls in sports have access to sports bras. As a part of a collaboration between the two organizations, volunteers braved the cold to mark National Women in Sports Day, Feb. 5, by heading to Acrisure Stadium to package and distribute 500 sports bras to 250 athletes from the Pittsburgh Allderdice, Brashear, Carrick, Obama, and Westinghouse flag football teams. click to enlarge Photo by Kyle Kron courtesy of the Pittsburgh Steelers A package to be sent to Pittsburgh flag football players As Rudy observed, studies have shown that, as girls get older, breast-related discomfort in the absence of a sports bra was an often-cited reason they’d stop participating in sports. Yet cost and parents’ discomfort in purchasing sports bras for their children can mean that the problem isn’t solved, and a promising athlete never reaches her full potential. Pittsburgh Penguins Chief People Officer and General Counsel Tracey McCants Lewis recalls that, during her childhood when she ran track, some of her teammates resorted to binding their breasts with ace tape to get the support they needed. Memories like that, Lewis said, make it important to ensure that current and future generations of female athletes aren’t in such dire straits. “Girls have dreams to be engaged in sports, and we want to make sure that they have the resources necessary … to be able to achieve their dreams, to be able to play and engage in sports,” Lewis said. “And so I think for the [four] sports teams to come together, to pull their resources together to be able to support girls and women in sport, is so important.” As a longtime supporter of girls' flag football teams in the commonwealth, Pittsburgh Steelers Director of Community Relations Blayre Holmes Davis says the NFL team couldn’t pass up the opportunity to help the players continue to live up to their potential. Additionally, Davis says that the drive’s donations went to flag football players as well as members of the soccer and swim teams. Davis added that the Steelers have supported the players by hosting clinics for girls' flag football. Davis explained that there was no better way to commemorate a holiday dedicated to celebrating how far women in sports have come than to continue showing support. click to enlarge Photo by Kyle Kron courtesy of the Pittsburgh Steelers Volunteers assemble sports bra packages on Feb. 5, 2025. “Girls flag football is now a sanctioned sport in Pennsylvania, and our team, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles, really worked hard to get that passed here,” Davis says. “And so we've worked really, really closely to make sure that we're not only collaborating with the schools and the folks who administer that program, but also just making sure we're able to lift the young women who participate in it.” Ultimately, although the partnership with Operation Warm is new and Women and Girls in Sports Day only comes once a year, the plan is to work year-round to give back to the City of Pittsburgh and ensure that female athletes have all that they need to thrive. “With the sports teams, we continue to all work together to make sure that our community is supported,” Davis said. “While we're excited for everything that happens on the field with our individual sports, we also really want people to know that each individual sports team is here to support the community.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Sports, FLY:FWD, Steelers, Penguins, Riverhounds, Nicole Rudy, Tracy McCants Lewis, Blayre Holmes Davis Related Content Yinzer Yums of Yesteryear: Throwback Steelers nachos By Stacy Rounds Aug 30, 2024 The Evolution of Sports in Pittsburgh: A Historical Overview Sponsored By Biz Rewritten May 20, 2024 Troy Polamalu will return to the 'Burgh for a greater cause By Justin Stewart May 2, 2024 The Riverhounds kick off 2024 with lights, cameras, and action — but a win would be nice By Colin Williams Mar 20, 2024 Latest in Sports Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

Kovac click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost John Brisker Almost 50 years after his presumed death in Idi Amin’s Uganda, Pittsburgh basketball icon John Brisker remains a legend for his fiery character on and off the court. Brisker’s willingness to take stands against injustices, both real and perceived, made headlines as early as 1969, when, as a student at the University of Toledo, he helped lead an on-court protest relating to the school’s suspension of one of his Black former teammates. Brisker and the other Black players were promptly booed off the court. But Brisker didn’t let the backlash dissuade him from standing up for what he believed to be right that February 1969 night in Toledo, or dissuade him from taking such stands throughout the remainder of his life. Whether or not his uncompromising approach led to his early demise remains a mystery. Brisker was born in the summer of 1947 and grew up in Hamtramck, Mich., a city near Detroit. In a 1972 interview, he described a tough upbringing that pushed him toward basketball: “We moved 15-20 times when I was growing up because we couldn’t pay the rent. I lived in a project when I was in high school. I had a lot of things frustrating me, so I’d take my frustrations outside and get rid of them shooting a basketball.” Brisker became star at Hamtramck High School, playing alongside future NBA All-Star and champion head coach Rudy Tomjanovich, before setting off for the University of Toledo in 1965. As was the case for all college freshmen at the time, Brisker was not permitted to play varsity basketball, but his freshman team dominated the varsity team every time they scrimmaged. When he did play varsity ball, Brisker excelled, averaging double figures in points while he played tight end for the school’s football team and even took up tuba for Toledo's marching band. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Brisker brought a football-type toughness to the basketball court. Throughout his college career, Brisker didn’t instigate fights, but he never backed down from any, either. In Dec. 1968, Brisker was suspended after missing a practice. A week later, his college career came to a close when he was declared academically ineligible to compete the rest of the season. He didn’t go quietly, helping to lead the aforementioned protest described above. In 1969, the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers selected Brisker in a supplemental draft; however, Brisker opted to sign with the Pittsburgh Pipers of the American Basketball Association instead. As a member of the Pipers — later the Pittsburgh Condors — Brisker was a scoring machine, averaging as many as 29.3 points per game. Pittsburgh coach and general manager Mark Binstein compared Brisker to NBA all-time greats Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. NBA legend Spencer Haywood later likened him to LeBron James. Even in the wild world of the ABA, Brisker’s antics stood out. Brisker was a bruiser — so much so that he earned the nickname The Heavyweight Champion of the ABA. Brisker disliked that reputation and referred to himself as nothing more than “an aggressive ballplayer, a competitor.” He rationalized that he only fought players who were bigger than him. At the same time, however, Brisker made statements that didn’t help his reputation, once saying that he would “do anything to put Pittsburgh in the playoffs,” even if that meant “breaking someone’s leg.” According to one witness, while on the floor for the 1971 All-Star game festivities, Brisker intimidated the ABA’s commissioner to dig into his own wallet to pay Brisker his $300 All-Star bonus on the spot. Other incidents included a fight with police at Three Rivers Stadium and an impromptu sparring match with Muhammad Ali inside a Miami airport. Teams intimidated by Brisker resorted to tactics never seen before or since, as when the Utah Stars tried to keep Brisker in line by surrounding the court with several professional boxers. Brisker responded by dropping 37 points in a six-point Condors victory. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson By late 1971, Brisker considered playing in Pittsburgh to be “a hassle” and said he was “tired of it.” In one of Brisker’s many attempts to increase his pay, he refused to practice or play for the Condors toward the end of that final ABA season. The Condors filed a lawsuit to stop him from signing with another team. Brisker threatened to make the jump to the NBA. Ultimately, the Condors folded after that 1971-72 season, and a brief stint with the Dallas Chaparrals ended when the Texas team dumped Brisker simply because of the color of his skin. A part-owner bluntly explained: “Last year Dallas had only two white players … compared to 10 black players, and we drew less than 100 fans who were colored.” He continued, “A bunch of people want white faces, someone they can identify with.” Seattle SuperSonics ownership didn’t share those racist concerns and signed Brisker to a six-year, $1 million contract. Brisker’s three seasons with Seattle were inconsistent and disappointing (at least in comparison to his performance in the ABA), but still respectable. During his first two seasons, he averaged more than 12 points per game despite receiving just over 20 minutes of playing time per game. click to enlarge Trouble managed to follow Brisker to the NBA even when he wasn’t to blame. Though a fan favorite, Brisker and Seattle’s new coach, NBA great Bill Russell, mixed like oil and water. As his time in Seattle progressed, Brisker increasingly found himself in Russell’s doghouse, and his playing time plummeted. Russell’s treatment of Brisker didn’t sit well with the fans who recognized Brisker’s talent. “We want Brisker” chants frequently broke out during Seattle’s home games. When given the opportunity, Brisker produced. In a matchup with the rival Portland Trail Blazers, he led the SuperSonics to a victory with 28 points. Off the court, Brisker had a reputation for being great with children, helping to organize a charity basketball game (starring the likes of Connie Hawkins) to raise funds for a basketball program targeting the youth in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. He, along with Pittsburgh Pirates’ greats Willie Stargell and Dock Ellis (among others), spent hours volunteering to raise funds for sickle cell anemia research. Regardless, Russell — who was also the SuperSonics’ general manager — was desperate to get rid of Brisker. He offered Brisker up in trades, but there were no takers. Ultimately, in the early part of 1974, Russell demoted Brisker to the Cherry Hill Rookies of the Eastern Basketball League (which, in essence, served as the NBA’s primary minor league at the time). In his first game with the Rookies, Brisker set a league record with 51 points. He followed up that performance with 58 points in his next game. While Brisker often expressed his desire to return to the NBA — and still had the talent to do so — he had burned all of his bridges. In 1977, with three years left on his contract, he accepted a buyout for half of what Seattle owed him. click to enlarge PHOTO: 1967 University of Toledo “Blockhouse” yearbook University of Toledo Rockets basketball player John Brisker from the 1967 “Blockhouse” yearbook Brisker’s final years were tough. In Pittsburgh, his wife filed for divorce. He was held in contempt for failing to pay child support. In Seattle, he had a child with another woman, Khalilah Rashad. He owned businesses that were drowning in debt. Brisker made several trips to Africa in pursuit of other business opportunities. According to Rashad, in March of 1978, Brisker traveled to Africa for the purposes of starting an import-export business. Rashad stated that Brisker had called her several times, and that she last heard from him on April 11, 1978. Brisker made that last call from Kampala, Uganda. His brother, Ralph, believed that he may have been taken as a prisoner of war. Others speculated that he was killed after crossing paths with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Still others reported that Brisker may have been killed while fighting as a mercenary/bodyguard for Amin. Brisker most likely suffered the same fate that so many others in Uganda suffered during Amin’s reign of terror — death via Uganda’s State Research Bureau. Records recovered after Amin’s ouster indicate that the already-paranoid Amin was being fed information that would have made Brisker a prime target of his wrath. Around the time of Brisker’s visit, Amin received a letter from Bob Astles (a British soldier who was close to Amin and was described in his 2012 obituary as “the most hated white man in postcolonial Africa”) that read: “Your excellency. We have evidence through documentation and interrogation that foreign companies are working against the Ugandan economy. We also have evidence that the C.I.A. is working against you. We would like to give our intelligence verbally. Your obedient servant, Bob Astles.” Such communications undermine rumors that Amin would have recruited Brisker — a United States businessman — to work for him in any way, let alone as a bodyguard. Brisker’s brother and Rashad both previously speculated that Brisker may have simply disappeared on his own accord, possibly under an assumed name, to avoid the growing debts and obligations he faced in the United States. However, he had quite a few close friends and family members, none of whom have heard from him in over 40 years. Moreover, Brisker went to Africa with a friend from Seattle named Benjamin Taylor, who likewise disappeared. There is little chance both Brisker and Taylor left the country, assumed new identities, and successfully avoided detection for such a long period of time — especially in light of the fact that both of their families, as well as a United States congressman, made multiple inquiries with the State Department in efforts to ascertain their whereabouts. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The State Department does not have any record that Brisker had entered Uganda, let alone died there. Nevertheless, State Department records do indicate that a source — whose name is redacted — provided the following information: “Benjamin Lewis Taylor [identified as Benjamin Lewis in the records] visited Uganda in the spring of 1977 and approached Amin with a deal to bring a black American business group to the country. Brisker joined Taylor. Subsequently, the two were accused of criminal activities, abducted from their rooms at the Kampala International Hotel, sent to the State Research Bureau, and never seen again”. During that time, the Kampala International Hotel was certainly not a safe place, as State Research Bureau agents used to frequent its rooftop nightclub and, when interested in a woman there, would sometimes throw competitors for her attention off the roof. A 1982 State Department record states that Brisker and Taylor “probably were in Uganda in 1977 and that they may have been killed [t]here.” Any Ugandan records relating to Brisker are likely long gone. In April 1979 — after Amin’s failed attack on Tanzania — Tanzanians and anti-Amin Ugandans forced Amin to flee the country. A 1979 New York Times article indicates that, two days before the State Research Bureau headquarters were abandoned, “smoke rose from the incinerator, leading to speculation that the most incriminating records had been burned.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson For those closest to Brisker, life had to go on. In June 1978, Brisker’s divorce was finalized. On May 29, 1985, at Rashad’s request, the King County Superior Court issued an order declaring that Brisker was officially presumed to be deceased. Unsatisfying as it may be, that King County order will likely remain the most definitive statement on Brisker’s fate. Brisker’s chaotic life most probably met a violent end, but any records that could be used to fill in the gaps of his story likely went up in flames when Amin was forced into exile. Brisker may not have survived past the age of 30, but he left an incomparable legacy behind.

Could it happen again? By Jonathan Burdick click to enlarge CP Illustration: Sam Schaffer Civic Arena hosted several basketball teams between 1961 and 1972. Connie Hawkins had a choice to make. He’d been kicked out of college, shut out of the NBA, joined a failed startup league, and after four years on the road with the Harlem Globetrotters, he’d hung up those shoes too. It was 1967 and, now in his mid-20s, he also had a family to feed. Maybe this opportunity with the Pittsburgh Pipers would provide short-term stability, if nothing else. Besides, Hawkins had absolutely no clue what else he could even do. If he couldn’t play ball, as he told sportswriter David Wolf, “I think that would just be the end of Connie Hawkins.” As Ebony Magazine expressed, he was trapped in a “Kafkaesque nightmare,” a sort of basketball purgatory. He wondered about winning his lawsuit against the NBA and getting a chance at his dream. After all, many believed he was one of the best basketball players on the planet. New York Knicks future hall-of-famer Willis Reed told LIFE Magazine that Hawkins would be an NBA superstar. “All the guys know it,” he said. Rival (and future Hall of Fame coach) Larry Brown called him “simply the greatest individual player I have ever seen.” Throughout the years, he’d insist Hawkins inspired Julius Erving who inspired Michael Jordan. This is the story of Hawkins, who briefly brought basketball greatness to the Steel City. Without Hawkins, the Pipers might have been a footnote in the sport's history — instead, his prowess with the Pipers, later dubbed the Condors, spurred changes in the NBA that made it the flashy, high-scoring affair it is today. From scandal to stardom Born on July 17, 1942 in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Corenlius Hawkins was one of six children. His father left when he was ten, and while his mother worked as a cook, she suffered from glaucoma. They struggled financially. His mother guided her quiet and self-conscious Connie towards the YMCA playgrounds where he discovered basketball. It wasn’t long before his legendary status as a “Brooklyn blacktop legend” was established. They nicknamed him “The Hawk.” Although Hawkins struggled academically, he excelled on the court for Brooklyn’s Boys High School. The team won two city titles and Hawkins earned Parade Magazine’s High School All-American accolades in 1960. Colleges were eager to recruit the 6’8” senior and he settled on the University of Iowa. While there though, still only a teenager, his name was mixed up in a widespread point-shaving scandal. It’s a complex story, but Hawkins was never arrested, charged, or named as being involved. Simply knowing some who were was enough. Iowa kicked him out. No other college would touch him. Nor would the NBA. Many neighborhood ballplayers back in Brooklyn shunned him. He cried often. All seemed hopeless. He felt he wasn’t good at anything besides basketball. Fortunately, the American Basketball League (ABL) was about to have its first season in 1961 and they needed talent. Founded by Harlem Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein, this eight-team league included a three-point shot and a 30 second shot clock. Even potential players were skeptical though. When the newly minted Pittsburgh Rens' ownership drafted one college standout, he balked. “I’d like to play ball,” he said, “but I want to be realistic about the future.” He became an accountant. As for Hawkins, he signed a contract for $6,500. “God don’t have this kind of money,” he thought. click to enlarge Photo: Wikimedia Commons Connie Hawkins with the Pittsburgh Rens in 1962 This wasn’t Pittsburgh's first professional basketball team. In 1946, there was the Pittsburgh Ironmen — but that team ended with a dismal 15-45 record and folded after a year. The Rens did better, finishing the season 41-40, but the entire league folded the following season. So, Hawkins joined Saperstein’s Harlem Globetrotters. For the next four years, he traveled with the team, making $125 each week while learning to really control the basketball confidently. “I had to learn to barnstorm,” he explained. These years greatly influenced his style. He did a lot of growing up, too, marrying a woman named Nancy and starting a family in Pittsburgh. Lawyers Roslyn and David Litman, family of former Rens owner Lenny Litman, also filed a $6 million lawsuit against the NBA on his behalf. By 1966, he’d had enough globetrotting and returned to an uncertain future in Pittsburgh. He'd sleep in. He’d play some playground ball. He’d think about the NBA. “It was the worst time of my life,” he’d recall. An upstart league Meanwhile, the American Basketball Association (ABA) was about to launch. Like the ABL, the ABA retained the three-pointer, kept the longer shot clock, and emphasized a faster-paced, flashier style of play. NBA legend George Mikan was hired as the league’s commissioner and eleven teams were finalized to compete. The Eastern Division included the Pittsburgh Pipers, Indiana Pacers, Kentucky Colonels, Minnesota Muskies, and New Jersey Americans. The Western Division had the Anaheim Amigos, Dallas Chaparrals, Denver Rockets, Houston Mavericks, New Orleans Buccaneers, and Oakland Oaks. Here Hawkins was then, faced with this choice: play in the ABA or, quite likely, nowhere. His lawsuit was ongoing, but the Pipers, co-owned by East End native Gabe Rubin, wanted Hawkins now. Rubin, who owned several local theaters, was described by the Jewish Chronicle as feisty, unpredictable, and a born showman. He was also very convincing. Hawkins signed a two-year contract worth $45,000. Ebony predicted that the Pipers would be the team to beat thanks to Hawkins, the “stringbean who is good enough to play in any league.” Vince Cazzetta, a mild-mannered college coach, was hired while management secured sharing the Civic Arena with the Pittsburgh Penguins. When the season commenced, Hawkins exceeded expectations. Media described his “razzle dazzle” and ability to handle the ball. He excelled one-on-one, made tricky passes, finger-rolled, and soared through the air. “Someone said if I didn't break the laws of gravity, I was slow to obey them,” Hawkins quipped to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Sports Illustrated said he might have been “the most skillful passer among all the big men who ever played.” Others commended his instincts and his ability to understand what everybody was doing on the court at all times. He was, it seemed, “playing a very fast game of chess.” This wasn’t translating to wins or attendance though. The Pipers started out 11-12 and barely cracked 2,000 fans. “Welcome to the Losers’ Club,” declared the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Some blamed Hawkins. “Quite often Connie is conning the fans,” claimed Pittsburgh Weekly Sports, adding harshly that all “he does is go around believing he's the greatest and that the world owes him a living.” Others blamed Cazzetta for “pampering” Hawkins. The team had to make some moves. They traded for Art Heyman, a former Duke University All-American who had NBA experience, but also a reputation for his intensity, short-temper, and on-court fights. “Art Heyman was crazy,” opponent (and future Syracuse University coach) Jim Boeheim would recall. “He was very explosive,” Vic Bubas, his college coach, said. “The trick,” he added, “was to direct the fire the right way.” Maybe that was exactly what the Pipers needed: a tough-as-nails swing man who could take outside shots, but also drive inside and rebound as needed. They won their next game. Then they won the next fourteen. The Pipers found their groove. Playing guard was Charlie Williams and Chico Vaughn. At forward was Tom “Trooper” Washington. The 6’9” Ira Harge, who’d been teaching public school the year prior, played center. Along with Heyman, support included Craig Dill, Jim Jarvis, Arvesta Kelly, Rich Parks, and Barry Leibowitz, with a rotating cast of others. As for Hawkins, Sports Illustrated called him the “best unknown pro in the land” while Los Angeles Stars coach Bill Sharman praised him as a mix of Oscar Robertson and Wilt Chamberlain. The Pipers ended the regular season with a league best record of 54-24. Despite this success, attendance rarely surpassed 3,000. “I do wish I could notice a little feeling, a little enthusiasm,” Cazzetta vented to the Pittsburgh Press. “It’s almost a feeling like who cares.” Entering the playoffs, they faced the Indiana Pacers first, sweeping them in three games. Next, they won the Eastern Division, beating the Minnesota Muskies 4-1. The championship series was against the New Orleans Buccaneers, an equally as fast, but more traditional team. Starting for New Orleans on April 18 in Pittsburgh were Larry Brown, Doug Moe, Red Robbins, Jimmy Jones, and Jackie Moreland. The Pipers won 120-112 with Hawkins dropping 39 points and Heyman and Williams scoring 26 each. New Orleans responded by winning the next two. Game four was in New Orleans with 7,000 in attendance. The Pittsburgh Press called the game “heart-stopping.” Up by three points and with only a few seconds left in regulation, the Pipers turned over the ball and Larry Brown sank a dramatic three-pointer to tie the game. Overtime was even more dramatic. Charlie Williams was fouled with only one second left and, game tied, he made the game-winning free throw. Hawkins, called “simply unstoppable” by the Pittsburgh Press, had contributed 47 points. The series was tied heading back to Pittsburgh, but there was bad news: Hawkins was out with a knee injury. The Pipers played well, but lost by three points. Game six was back in New Orleans. Forcing a game seven would bring the final game back to Pittsburgh. “If we win down there,” Cazzetta said, “we'll win the championship.” Hawkins had practiced lightly and set to return. He wasn’t the only one battered either. Vaughn was nursing a hamstring injury while also dealing emotionally with the death of his father. Heyman had a sprained ankle and tonsillitis. Washington’s jaw was broken. At the half, Pittsburgh was down 72-59, but they battled back to win 118-112. Back in Pittsburgh, they had a crowd of 11,375 for game seven – more than the previous three home games combined. The Pipers pulled it off, winning the final game 122-113. New Orleans coach Babe McCarthy said graciously that the Pipers were the better team, adding that Williams was “just fantastic” and Hawkins was “one of the greatest basketball players in the country.” Rubin beamed at the crowd. The city had shown up. Maybe Pittsburgh could be a basketball city after all. “Isn’t that something?” he uttered. “It makes you feel like it was all worthwhile.” Cazzetta was pleased too, telling UPI, “I hope we can start off this way next year.” They wouldn’t get the chance. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of the Heinz History Center, Detre Library & Archives. Pittsburgh Pipers ABA Basketball Team, 1967-68. Hawkins is holding the league's distinct red, white, and blue ball at center. Headed north Rumors spread that the Pipers were leaving Pittsburgh. Post-Gazette sports editor Al Abrams said nobody “financially inclined” could blame them. Rubin publicly denied the rumors, but admitted he’d thought about it and wanted to stay in Pittsburgh if “economically possible.” An unidentified source told the Post-Gazette, “There's something in the wind.” Meanwhile, Cazzetta was named League Coach of the Year and Hawkins was unanimously selected as Most Valuable Player. Statistics demonstrated a very well-balanced team. The Pipers had a promising future. Then the bombshell on June 28: they’d be the Minnesota Pipers next season. William J. Erickson, a Minneapolis lawyer, had purchased a majority stake and while Rubin said he loved Pittsburgh, the team needed to grow their fanbase. Cazzetta was not happy. He made it clear to Rubin that he was going to need a new contract to uproot his wife and six children. On July 12, the Pittsburgh Press revealed that Rubin and Cazzetta hadn’t spoken in a week. The feud played out publicly through the media. Rubin expected Cazzetta to honor his contract. Cazzetta stated plainly that he had a legal right to terminate it. His calls with new general manager Vern Mikkelson weren’t productive. Erickson claimed he wasn’t opposed to a raise, but Cazzetta countered that Mikkelson had outright refused any increase in salary. “He must think this is fun,” Rubin cracked. Cazzetta resigned. Rubin unleashed on him to the Pittsburgh Weekly Sports, calling him an “overrated” and “lousy” coach. “In my opinion,” he seethed, “the Pipers won in spite of Vince Cazzetta.” “When he was selling the club, he said I was the best coach in the country,” responded Cazzetta. Charles Kramer, publicity director for the Pipers, defended Cazzetta in the Post-Gazette, calling Rubin's comments “unwarranted” and saying that Cazzetta had helped turn a preseason “squad of misfits” into a championship team. Players weren’t happy either. As Williams recalled in Terry Pluto’s Loose Balls, the team trusted Cazzetta. He understood he didn’t need to overcoach them. “Vince’s personality was why the guys on the team pulled together and won a championship,” he said. College coach Jim Harding was hired as Cazzetta’s replacement for the 1968-69 season. The Pipers started strong, winning 18 of their first 25 games, but health issues for Harding and player injuries slowed their momentum. Tensions with Harding didn’t help. He coached with an unfamiliar intensity interpreted by the team as a lack of respect. “I believe in what I do and what I do is sometimes controversial,” Harding admitted. “All I want out of life are championships.” Players called him a maniac behind his back. He kicked over chairs. He’d scream. It was a far cry from Cazzetta’s laid-back approach. “I’m an intense person,” said Harding. He was a perfectionist and expected his team to give as much as he did. Hawkins then went down with another knee injury. It required surgery and he missed 25 games. Then during All-Star weekend, Harding and Rubin got into a physical fight over comments Harding made about some players. Rubin fired Harding. “I guess that incident does not add luster to my reputation,” joked Harding. Mikkelsen took over, but the losing streak continued. They finished with a 36-42 record and a heap of debt. Relocation rumors circulated again. To the surprise of many, they decided to return to Pittsburgh for the 1969-70 season. Unfortunately, the team lost their star. The NBA settled with Hawkins for $1.3 million dollars and lifted their ban. He signed with the Phoenix Suns where he’d have a stellar season. “I don’t have to be ashamed anymore,” said Hawkins, crediting his lawyers and writer David Wolf for clearing his name. The Pipers still had Williams, Vaughn, and Washington, but the team shuffled a total of 22 other players and two coaches throughout the season. Their new star rookie was swingman John Brisker who was not the gentle-natured and humble Hawkins. Brisker could be downright mean with an explosive temper. In 2002, Seattle Times described him as “Mike Tyson with a buttery jumper.” He’d throw elbows and sometimes fists. He also just scared people. “Say something wrong to the guy,” Williams reflected, “and you had this feeling that John would reach into his bag, take out a gun and shoot you.” Indeed, most knew he carried his gun. There was genuine love for him too, but teammates knew how easy it was to set him off. Despite Brisker’s legitimate talent, the season flopped. Coach John Clark was fired after a 14-25 start and Buddy Jeannette didn’t fare any better, winning fifteen but losing thirty more, ending with a dismal record of 29-55. The Condors fly away In April, it was announced that the Pipers were sold to a subsidiary of Raven Industries. For the 1970-71 season, they’d also rebrand as the Pittsburgh Condors. Jack McMahon was hired as coach while Marty Blake, hired as general manager, promised he would build “a basketball tradition in Pittsburgh.” “Condors do have the potential to be a good team,” insisted Ebony. Brisker was entering his second season and veteran Charlie Williams was returning too. The rebrand didn’t help though. They finished 36-48. Attendance was poor as ever. Mark Binstein, general manager for the 1971-72 season, tried without luck to get Connie Hawkins to come back. McMahon remained coach. They weren’t contenders last year, he told Beaver County Times, but they had improved. “I root too hard for [my players] to make it and sometimes it clouds my judgment,” he said. “[I]t’s a weakness I’m aware of.” Binstein apparently agreed. He fired McMahon after a 4-6 start. “McMahon's weakness was that he was too nice a fellow with the players,” he told the press. The players needed more discipline. Binstein, a talented guard at West Point, took on coaching duties, despite little coaching experience. It didn’t go well. They won only 21 of the next 74 games. During their final home game, the organist played “Taps.” While there were plans to relocate, they never had the chance. The ABA bought them out, shut them down, and redistributed the players. click to enlarge Photo: Wikimedia Commons Connie Hawkins holds the 1968 ABA MVP trophy As for Brisker, he joined the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA until 1975. After leaving, he allegedly traveled to Uganda where he disappeared and was presumed dead. Charlie Williams retired from the ABA in 1973, having scored over 6,000 points. Chico Vaughn worked in a public school for two decades, while Trooper Washington returned to basketball in 2004 to coach the Pennsylvania Pit Bulls, tragically collapsing and dying during their first game. Art Heyman was inducted in the Duke Sports Hall of Fame. Connie Hawkins played seven seasons in the NBA, earning All-Star status between 1970-73. He retired in 1976. Living in Pittsburgh still (and later Wilkinsburg), he lent his name to the successful Connie Hawkins League, which lasted for decades and was, as the Post-Gazette described it, tough competition “that only a basketball junkie can appreciate.” In 1992, he was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. The call brought him to tears. “He had to fight, fight, fight,” former Phoenix Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. “And the fact that he accomplished what he did, we can look back and say, ‘Hawk, you did good.’” The ABA merged with the NBA in June 1976 bringing into the league new teams, the three-point shot, and a new style of play that changed the game forever. “The ABA is long gone,” The Washington Post declared in 2017, the year Hawkins passed away, “but it remains the soul of the NBA.” The Pittsburgh Pipers remain Pittsburgh’s only championship professional basketball team. If the city has its way though, they may not be the last. As recently reported, the city’s Sports and Exhibition Authority is exploring the sustainability of an NBA or WNBA franchise in Pittsburgh. “The Steel City has earned the right to be considered for an NBA expansion team because of its rich history as a tough sports town,” David J. Hunt recently wrote for Yardbarker. Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, Pittsburgh could be a basketball city after all.

Discovery Puppy Bowl XXI Team Fluff member Mercury, from Paws Across Pittsburgh The Steelers will likely not make it to the Super Bowl this year, but the Animal Planet Puppy Bowl gives Pittsburgh sports fans a way to cheer on some different local athletes. Not only that, locals can support these furry little yinzers by voting to make one of them the \"Most Pupular\" player. Four-legged athletes were drafted from rescue groups nationwide to hit the field for Puppy Bowl XXI. The annual event — airing live Sun., Feb. 9 on Animal Planet — offers dog lovers an adorable alternative to the big game. A press release says that the three-hour television event will feature \"142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states — and two countries — as they compete in the cutest competition of the year.\" Those 40 states include Pennsylvania, and it makes sense that a hardcore football town like Pittsburgh has not one, not two, but three pups representing the city. All three dogs — a Boxer/Pitbull mix named Sully, a Great Pyrenees mix named Mercury, and a Pitbull mix named Franco — come from Paws Across Pittsburgh, a nonprofit, foster-based animal rescue group based in Springdale. The volunteer-run organization provides various services, including transporting and finding vet care for animals in need, sponsoring local spay-and-neuter clinics, running a monthly pantry to help local families feed their pets, and more. This is the second time Paws Across Pittsburgh has participated in the Puppy Bowl — last year, two of their rescue dogs, Gertie and Margo, were featured in the event. \"Last year, the Puppy Bowl committee reached out to us and invited us to go. We thought it would be a great opportunity for the rescue, so we went!\" Jackie Armour, president and founder of Paws Across Pittsburgh, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. \"We were excited to get invited back again this past year, so were very happy to return.\" Armour says this year's dogs have \"all been adopted and are living their best lives in their adopted homes.\" click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Discovery Puppy Bowl XXI Team Fluff member Sully, from Paws Across Pittsburgh Beyond providing an adorable alternative to Super Bowl festivities, the Puppy Bowl sets out to help the participating rescue groups, their adoptable athletes, and other animals in their care. A press release states that the event will highlight each dog's \"inspiring journeys from birth to adoption, as well as the tremendous dedication of the rescues and shelters that help find animals their forever homes.\" \"Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl serves as an annual pop culture programming event that continues to expand in reach, awareness and of course, puppies, every year,\" said Howard Lee, chief creative officer of U.S. Networks and president of Discovery Networks, adding that the Bowl, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, \"will inspire families across the country to adopt a new furry friend.\" click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Discovery Puppy Bowl XXI Team Ruff member Franco, from Paws Across Pittsburgh In the days leading up to the Puppy Bowl XXI, fans can vote for a dog to receive the distinction of \"Most Pupular\" player. Voting began on Jan. 10 and will continue through Thu., Feb. 6, with daily chances to show support for your favorite pooch. Paws Across Pittsburgh will also host a Puppy Bowl Celebration Pawty on Sun., Feb. 16 at the Brackenridge American Legion, which includes BINGO, raffles, and chances to meet this year's player pups. Armour has seen the benefits of participating in the Puppy Bowl and says she hopes her organization gets invited every year. \"Being in the Puppy Bowl brought a lot of attention to our rescue,\" she says. \"With a lot of attention, our adoptions went up and we did receive more donations! Plus the pups got to go and have fun and be stars!\" Puppy Bowl XXI. 2 p.m. Sun., Feb. 9.

William's voice is smoky and powerful. As a multi-instrumentalist and a songwriter, the experience of listening to her music is intimate and intense. Squirrel Flower is on tour across the U.S. this winter, and will be stopping in Pittsburgh on Mon., Feb. 7 at Club Cafe. She will be joined by musical artist Mia Joy. Pittsburgh City Paper got the chance to ask Squirrel Flower five questions ahead of her show. 1. Will this be your first time in Pittsburgh? Yeah, it actually is my first time ever in Pittsburgh. Somehow, I was supposed to tour there in March of 2020, but obviously that ended up not happening. I'm really excited. It's always really fun to see a new place, and I feel like Pittsburgh is one of those overlooked, underrated cities. I've always gotten the sense that it just has a really sick music and art scene. I'm excited to stop through for sure. 2. Did you always know you were able to sing? What has it been like honing your voice and your craft since you started music professionally? I've always been a singer. My dad has been a professional bass player for pretty much his whole life, like, since he was 16. He got a scholarship to Berkeley College of Music and just moved out there by himself and started playing music, and has done that for several decades. So I grew up around that and was part of an ensemble and taught myself how to play various instruments that were lying around the house. We had family jam sessions and stuff like that. But since I started doing it professionally, which I would say was when I started [DIY] touring when I was 18, and then when I graduated from college, I sort of decided to take the next step and try and have it be more full-time. Not like a job, I just don't like thinking of it as a job. But I wanted to really have the goal of being able to make music, so I can have that be the main thing I do and not have to have another job. I've spent the past four years working in food service, aside from [the COVID pandemic] when I was getting unemployment and government checks, which was sick because I could just focus on music. Since I started professionally, or more intentionally, spending all of my time doing it with specific goals in mind, and on a record label and with a manager and all of that, it's a constant state of evolution. I think because even though I do have a specific sound and the project is a solo project and it's very much mine and I don't think it's changed all that much from album to album, there have been subtle changes. But it's not like I was making folk and now I'm making techno. So it is in a constant state of evolution and I try to always be self critical, not overly critical. But yeah, just self aware and constantly looking at what I'm doing and finding new ways to do it. 3. I noticed while listening to Planet (i) that you also do all the writing as far as lyrics go. What do you do to get yourself in the headspace to write a song? It's really hard. For as long as I've been writing songs, the way I write them is not always intentional. It's just sort of how it has always happened. As long as I've been a songwriter, I've gone through long periods of writer's block and I take a step back from actively producing songs. I think incubation is really important. So my process is surrounded by periods of not writing, but still playing music and still improvising and playing guitar and using my voice, but just not sitting down to write a song. But after a few months or even like a year, I feel a sense of inspiration and sit down and write a whole album sometimes. It comes when it comes and I try to nurture my creative process while I'm not actively writing. I try to harness it into a voice to memo or onto paper as soon as I can. When I do feel like it's time to write, I've tried different methods. I've tried being more regimented about it and sitting down every day at like 9 a.m. and trying to write songs for hours. And I can bang out some songs like that, but they never feel quite there and it feels more like a chore than an art form. I really think a huge part of my process is what's happening when I'm not actively creating. 4. There is, of course, a lot of nature imagery in the album, but also a focus on water. What is your relationship to water? It's a fraught one. Since I was young, I would go to swimming lessons at the YMCA and just refuse to go in, then refuse to put my head under the water because I wasn't scared of drowning, but there was something about the power of being engulfed by water. That really scared me as a kid. To this day, I'm pretty afraid of deep water and huge tidal waves. Also, water coming from the sky as well and huge, powerful thunderstorms. I’ve had so many intense nightmares throughout my life about it. I kind of thought it was time to face my fears a little bit through the songs. I didn't go into it intentionally facing my fears through writing the songs. But after I wrote a couple songs, I realized that was kind of what the songs were telling me about the theme that was unfolding. I was thinking more about climate change and the inevitability of it. Every person will be face-to-face with a, a massive disaster of some sort and that is the scariest thing ever to think about. I’m just trying to stare it down and not be destroyed by the fear of it. 5. I’m wondering if you go into creating with a certain goal, or do you make music for the pure joy of it? Maybe getting joy out of it is a goal in itself? I think it fluctuates. Now that I have more of an audience than I've ever had, it's hard to keep in mind. Just the idea of making music for the joy of it, that's something that I struggle with. It’s hard to go into creating something and not be thinking about people, listening to it and experiencing it and what they're going to think and how they're gonna process it. Whenever I feel that way, I kind of get out of that by playing music with my friends and my siblings and just going crazy and having, like, insane jam sessions. I like playing music that is nothing like the music I make for Squirrel Flower. Or diving into a different art practice, like painting or drawing, which I really love to do. I've found ways to bring myself back to the mindset of making art just to make art because it's joyful and like an amazing thing to do as a human being. It’s a way to celebrate life. Squirrel Flower.

Harris - EarthSeed The name EarthSeed comes from the 1990's novels Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents written by award-winning Black science-fiction author Octavia E. Butler. The fiction books chronicle 21st-century America as it unravels into horrific, tyrannical mayhem, and those who were once considered middle-class citizens struggle to survive in a violent reality void of normalcy, family, and resources. Seemingly more prophetic as time goes on, one of the characters in the Parables, Lauren Oya Olamina, helps rebuild her community through Earthseed, an \"egalitarian philosophy and spiritual practice which honors inquiry, independent thinking, and realistic acceptance of constant change.\" Nicole Mitchell and Lisa E. Harris's EarthSeed is inspired by and a tribute to Butler's work. In response to the chaotic and atrocious turn our society is taking, the composers have made a sonic EarthSeed. The 11-track project is both soft and energetic, utilizing spoken word and solo instrumentation to create something spiritually moving. EarthSeed by Nicole Mitchell & Lisa E. Harris Merce Lemon - Moonth Merce Lemon's first full-length album, Moonth, officially dropped on all streaming outlets last week. But those on Bandcamp may have gotten to hear it a little bit earlier, as Crafted Sounds and Darling Records (the labels are doing a co-releasing) released Moonth on the platform a week prior. With her father Greg Pierce on guitar, the album is a bedroom pop blend of blues and indie-folk. From the indie rock stomper “Sardines,” to the jangly hitter “Baby,” to the stripped-down solo “Disco Ball,” you can hear the bond shared between father and daughter as their guitars weave in and out. 100% of all profits from this release will be donated to the Pittsburgh-based Black Unicorn Library and Archives Project, with a commitment to a minimum donation of $200.

Coincidentally, one of the most beloved young bands in Pittsburgh hardcore right now is called Kicked in the Head by a Horse. They haven’t made it to Coachella yet, but they did play Rhode Island’s Quahog Clam Jam to nearly 700 screamo kids earlier this spring — and the crowd went absolutely apeshit. Like Feeble Little Horse, whose fuzzy sound resonated at a time when shoegaze interest was rising nationally, Kicked in the Head by a Horse — commonly shortened to KITHBAH — are gaining momentum in tandem with a nationwide surge in the exact type of mathy, moshy screamo music they specialize in. Since forming in early 2022, they’ve released several EPs and other short-form projects, most recently a must-hear November split with the comparatively mellow Pittsburgh screamo band Morning Dew. &lt;a href=\"https://kickedintheheadbyahorse.bandcamp.com/album/cold-hearts-warmer-words\"&gt;Cold Hearts Warmer Words by Kicked in the Head by a Horse&lt;/a&gt; KITHBAH have also become a known quantity on the local live circuit, pleasing Preserving Underground crowdkillers and Mr. Roboto Project push-pitters alike. They even had a few skeptical jean jacket punks nodding along approvingly during a recent gig with Rock Room denizens Speed Plans and Big Baby. KITHBAH’s sound is a unique amalgam of aesthetic screamo à la Saetia and Orchid and blast-beaten mathcore inspired by The Chariot and Converge — but peppered with the type of cartilage-crushing breakdowns that today’s hardcore moshers slaver for. The way their music offers both emotional catharsis and quickfire physicality allows them to straddle several hardcore micro-scenes that are often rigidly divided among social and artistic lines. It probably won’t come as a surprise that a band named Kicked in the Head by a Horse started on less-than-serious terms. The quartet — singer V. Kavanshansky, guitarist Larry Rupp, bassist Nate Hoff, and drummer Jacob Laurine — originated as a casual side-project; Rupp had some demos, and the other members asked to collaborate on them. Their patently absurd moniker originates from a list of reasons why people were allegedly sent to the insane asylum in the 1800s, including for getting kicked in the head by a horse. “That is so stupid; let’s make that the name,” Kavanshansky recalls thinking. click to enlarge Photo: Christian West Between their silly name and their cheeky use of Family Guy soundbites as mosh calls (Lois Griffin saying “Peter, the horse is here,” introduces the head-stomping breakdown of “Charles Bonnett”), KITHBAH don’t take themselves oppressively seriously. But they're definitely not a joke band. Kavanshansky and Rupp both seem like well-adjusted adults while speaking with Pittsburgh City Paper on a chilly December afternoon, but as they begin talking about their unconventional upbringings, I learn about the real-deal darkness fueling KITHBAH’s music. Rupp was raised in a conservative Christian household in Kittanning, where he was both homeschooled and extremely socially isolated. “The majority of my childhood, I didn’t really leave the house more than once a week,” he says. Getting the internet at 14 years old liberated him from his bubble and introduced him to heavy music, and, eventually, he integrated into the Pittsburgh metal and hardcore scene — the first secular community he’d ever been a part of. Rupp describes his current worldview as “the complete opposite” of what he was indoctrinated with growing up, and he uses KITHBAH to process the frustrating contradictions of conservative ideology through mind-warping riffage. “Most conservatives are just full of fear,” he says. “They think that if they react in this certain way and have these certain beliefs, then that's the proper way to react to that fear. In a sense, I try to channel that through music with chaos and randomness — but have it be controlled.” click to enlarge Photo: Christian West KITHBAH’s convulsive music has been a crucial emotional outlet for Kavanshansky as well. Their parents got divorced when the singer was young, and they grew up bouncing between houses, leading them into “stupid kid stuff” in their teens like stealing beer from their parents and experimenting with drugs. “Growing up moving houses a bunch and not having a solid home to come home to, I was always trying to rebel,” Kavanshansky says. Their drug and alcohol abuse snowballed in their early twenties and also coincided with some mental health turbulence. At 20, they were admitted into the psych ward and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. “It was a really weird time because I was doing a lot of drugs, so everything was skewed,” Kavanshansky calmly explains. “I had a psychotic break, and I just remember my dad bringing me into the hospital and them taking all my stuff.” KITHBAH’s 2024 TV Therapy EP was specifically influenced by that period in the vocalist’s life, and many of the band’s lyrics, which Kavanshansky co-writes with bassist Hoff, deal with themes of addiction and self-hatred. Going forward, however, Kavanshansky hopes that their most trying times are behind them. The singer tells me, proudly, that they're just over four months sober from alcohol. “It’s a huge change,” they say. “Basically everything bad I’ve ever done or gotten arrested [for] has revolved around alcohol.” Unless you tried to decode KITHBAH’s abstract lyrics on Bandcamp, you wouldn’t know anything about the members’ personal backgrounds. Their live persona, especially, seems shrouded in mystery. Kavanshansky’s onstage demeanor is shifty and cryptic; they rarely make eye contact with the audience and never address the crowd between songs. With one arm tucked behind their back (a classic screamo stance) and the mic resting suavely beneath their chin, their shrieking fits appear both poetically coordinated and unconsciously expressive. Sometimes, they get so caught up in the performance that they completely forget that other people are watching. “When we play live, it’s definitely very freeing,” Kavanshansky says. “I can do whatever I want up there and just flop around and scream and yell, and all that pent-up anger from the years growing up just pours out of me.” Kavanshansky doesn’t even have to say the band’s name. KITHBAH’s regular set opener, “method acting for playing dead,” begins with a sample of a comedian uttering the band’s titural phrase — which then snaps into a flesh-pounding riff. It’s one of the only predictable moments in the band’s otherwise frenzied live shows, but Kavanshansky, who wants to eventually become more talkative onstage, hopes they won’t be opening their shows with “method” for much longer. “I’m not sick of it,” they clarify. “I just want to play some of this new stuff.” Rupp cuts in: “The new stuff is a whole other level of chaos,” he says, chuckling. That “new stuff” encompasses not one, but two, fresh releases — and KITHBAH fans won’t have to wait long to hear them. In early spring of 2025, they plan to drop a split with another rising group of Pittsburgh heavyweights, and then release an additional EP of their own material around the same time. Rupp says that the new batch of songs are “heavy as shit” — especially the four tracks on the split release, which tone down the band’s screamo side and ratchet up the metallic violence. ”It’s totally different from what we normally do, but it’s still us,” Rupp enthuses. “It’s very fast, heavy, and all over the place.” The songs on the accompanying KITHBAH EP are supposedly even crazier. “It’s basically at the limit of what me and [Hoff, bassist] can play musically,” Rupp says. “I actually hate playing some of the riffs because I’m like, ‘why the fuck did I write this?’” The band aim to bring those new songs on the road as much as possible next year. They have fans as far as California begging them to play their cities, and have been in talks with a label about a potential signing once they get some more touring under their belts. But the most excited Kavanshansky and Rupp get during our interview is when they're talking about Pittsburgh. They're fully cognizant of how their band is uncommonly appreciated by several different factions of their hometown’s greater scene. In September 2023, they played a free EP release show at Mr. Roboto that brought screamo softies and hardcore tough-talkers together into one pit — and they hope to do it again early next year. “I feel like over the years there’s been a slight divide between hardcore kids and DIY [punk] kids,” Rupp says. “But I like that when we did that free show, it felt like both those scenes came together a little bit. It was just a mixture of everyone — it was awesome.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Music, Kicked in the Head by a Horse, Larry Rupp, V.

By Matthew Monroy click to enlarge CP Photo: Pat Cavanagh DJ Malcolm Threat Trying to put together a list of up-and-coming Pittsburgh bands, singers, DJs, and rappers is like asking me to name all the bridges in this city. There are a lot. This list focuses on the young talent cropping up around the city, though it also includes an older force new to the scene, a three-year-old trio forging inclusive spaces under the radar, and a band keeping their Pittsburgh roots despite a fan base stretching to the West Coast. The abundance of talent also means an abundance of omissions — this list easily could have stretched to 20 bands forging paths in Pittsburgh, representing genres such as hardcore, experimental acoustic, and power-pop. With that in mind, the following six artists serve as a sample of some of the noteworthy, surprising, and innovative music happening in Pittsburgh right now. Want to support them? See them live and buy their music. Valleyview The four guys — Jesse Farine (vocals, guitars), Benjamin Volk (drums), Ethan Herring (bass), and Jared Anderson (guitar) — who comprise Valleyview are all in their early-20s, some in school, others college dropouts. Give their song “Nevermind” a spin and Farine’s sonorous voice and strident guitar playing will have you thinking you’re hearing a late-30s Paul Banks. Valleyview’s debut five-track EP I Feel Like You're Haunting Me, released March 17, is a showcase of the members’ musical chemistry and a confident indicator of the band’s potential. While they aren’t reinventing the wheel, the surprisingly catchy riffs and vocals that lurk underneath the mix — warm and glazy on “Cure Song” and fuzzed-out on “Television”— have a way of sticking in your head longer than the average collegiate post-punk outfit. The Valleyview Bandcamp page defines its sound as “American Windmill Music,” a reference to a wave of contemporary English post-punk bands including Black Midi, Squid, and Black Country, New Road, that got their start at the pub/oddball-music venue The Windmill in London. Farine cites those groups and indie touchstones like The Strokes as inspiration for Valleyview’s music, an influence apparent in the driving bass lines on the EP’s closing track “Hiding.” Combine that with the song’s sad-quirky lyrics (“I don’t care as long as it feels like fate”) and you’ve got a band worth sweating in a dusty South Oakland basement for. click to enlarge CP Photo: Pat Cavanagh DJ Malcolm Threat at Carnegie Mellon’s WPTS Radio Station Malcolm Threat Tune into Carnegie Mellon University’s college radio station WRCT 88.3 on a Friday at 4 p.m. and you’ll hear the house and techno tunes of the affable Malcolm Threat, aka Charlotte Lamm. A Cognitive Science major by day and emerging DJ by night, Lamm takes inspiration from English electronic groups like The Orb, Prodigy, and Orbital, as well as CMU grad Yaeji, who also got her start at WRCT. Malcolm Threat DJ sets combine the headrush of chronically online tunes with house-music staples. That is, you’re as likely to hear a nightcore version of Taylor Swift’s “Romeo and Juliet” as you are a UK drum-and-bass sample. Originally from the California Bay Area, Lamm has found a home among other WRCT DJs and in Pittsburgh’s thriving underground electronic scene. She’s made the rounds at Oakland venues, playing to a packed house at a memorable costumed Halloween show at DIY venue The Deli last year. Lamm tells Pittsburgh City Paper that she enjoys the intimate, ego-less environment of these shows, where the crowd’s vibe is easier to gauge. Lamm’s weekly radio show, called Back2Businness, sees her spinning live tracks each Friday with other DJs, including CMU contemporaries Mushu (Mike Xu) and Big Cashew (Kingston Cox), and older DJs like Ron Mist (Dylan Kersten). Earlier this month, Mist tapped Lamm, along with Royal Haunts and DJ Shoe, to be a part of the first installment of Roundhouse, a Boiler-Room style dance night at Bottlerocket Social Hall. Lamm also plans on forming a CMU DJ trio with Big Cashew and lotusland called The Muck ahead of outdoor shows this summer. Wanna listen to Lamm’s music? When City Paper asked why she only has a few mixes on her SoundCloud, she gave a very DJ response. In short, you had to be there, man. “I prefer the ephemeral stuff where it’s just on the radio and if you happen to hear it, you hear it,” Lamm tells City Paper. “Sometimes, when you’re DJing, the thing you’re creating only matters in the moment, when everything’s coming together live.” click to enlarge Photo: Micah E Wood feeble little horse feeble little horse In most ways, feeble little horse — Lydia Slocum (vocals, bass), Sebastian Kinsler (guitar), Jacob Kelly (drums), and Ryan Walchonski (guitar) — is an outlier on this list. They’ve existed as a band for about two years now, are signed to Saddle Creek Records — making them labelmates with Indigo de Souza, Spirit of the Beehive, and Big Thief’s early work — and leave for a country-spanning tour in June in support of their upcoming album Girl with Fish. While they may have more hype than the others on this list, any mention of the local indie music scene must include name-dropping the distortion-pop quartet, the music of which has come to define the Pittsburgh shoegaze-adjacent scene, even if they might have surpassed it. Don’t worry — despite the NPR shoutouts and Pitchfork praise, feeble little horse remains a Pittsburgh band through and through. Guitarist Sebastian Kinsler produces the majority of their songs out of a South Oakland apartment, and they record in a South Side studio. The band’s approach to song production is notable for its spontaneity — any open spots are filled in with sonic scraps, such as hot-mic studio dialogue, an Alex G-esque “huh!” sound effect, and other internet finds (early fans will remember the Pi’erre Bourne producer tag that used to open “Termites” before copyright issues forced them to change it). Most songs on Girl with Fish were conceived around the same time as their first album, Hayday, though drummer Kelly tells City Paper that the release has a distinct style to it. “Hayday was recorded in the span of, like, one week, maybe less than that. We literally thought it was gonna be the last time we were all gonna be together, so it was like a big send-off. But we got to take our time with this record. The production’s a lot cleaner.” Judging from Girl with Fish’s first single “Tin Man,” featuring Slocum’s quotable lyrics and sludgy backing guitars, there’s nothing feeble about this sophomore album. feeble little horse: Girl With Fish Summer Tour. 7 p.m. Thunderbird Music Hall. 4053 Butler St., Lawrenceville. $16. thunderbirdmusichall.com click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham eyewash including Jack Wells (drums), Jake Yensik (guitar, backing vocals), Gin Garner (synthesizer), Alex Walsh (guitar, vocals), and Rachel Hines (bass, vocals) eyewash eyewash, a new dream-pop five-piece consisting of Rachel Hines (bass, vocals), Jack Wells (drums), Alex Walsh (guitar, vocals), Gin Garner (synthesizer), and Jake Yencik (guitar, vocals), draws from the beloved pop bands of its members’ youths to create a reverb-filled soundscape of faraway vocals and rueful, longing lyrics. Amongst Pittsburgh’s multitude of hardcore acts — some of which, such as Shin Guard and Hazing Over, claim eyewash bandmates as members — eyewash’s self-titled EP, released March 20, introduces the band as a slower, but equally angsty alternative. The first track, “Spinning,” starts with Hines despairing in overindulgence above a flighty keyboard trail and steady drumbeat: “I’m wasted, I’m alone, it’s all good.” If “Spinning” is eyewash’s dream-pop side, then the EP’s single, “Kaleidoscope,” showcases the band’s pop-punk skills as well. Patchy drums and a snaking guitar underscore Hines' voice singing of young-adulthood malaise and fury: “I do not owe an explanation / For the things I feel and the way I deal / Guess I wake up on the wrong side sometimes.” Hines, who studied neuroscience and psychology in college and now does clinical research into sleep apnea, says that the dream-focused aspects of her job make their way into her music. Check out the jargon-filled lyrics of “Somnium” (Latin for “dream”), which look like a mouthful on the page but roll unhurriedly through the song’s melodies: “Hypnagogic tones unravel sopor I can’t shake / Blank eyes dart back and forth, the soul’s window‘s opaque.” It’s this kind of casualness that defines eyewash’s sound — ambivalently sad and disruptively PO’d when need be. click to enlarge CP Photo: John Colombo Dyspheric’s Samira Mendoza, Stephanie “XC-17” Alona, and Yessi Dyspheric It might take out-of-towners by surprise, but Pittsburgh boasts an underground electronic music scene of surprising force. Chief amongst the scene is Dyspheric, a DJ collective consisting of founder Stephanie Alona, Samira Mendoza, and Yessi. The collective organizes events for the often-underserved Black trans community. Alona, who DJs under the name XC-17, started the collective to unite the community in a communal spot — the dancefloor. Dyspheric originated in 2020 when the pandemic shut down Alona’s upcoming DJ gigs, forcing them to creatively share their music. Alona turned to livestreaming DJ sets on Instagram, eventually joining forces with Mendoza and Yessi, the three of which began creating consistent Dyspheric shows on Verge F.M., a former independent radio platform. As clubs started to reopen, the three hosted shows at Hot Mass, Spirit, and other venues around the city. Now, three years later, their consistent online content and shows have made them a hot ticket. Dyspheric’s live sets and streams range from schmaltzy remixes of pop hits to unsparing dark techno. Recently, the collective has used its SoundCloud to spotlight fellow DJs such as Naeem, a member of Pittsburgh’s techno crew Detour, and a to-be-announced Seattle DJ for an upcoming episode. Though its event programming slowed down this winter, Dyspheric is gearing up for a music-filled summer. The members plan on delivering more energetic club shows that fans have come to expect, as well as expanding into more DIY venues, according to Alona. Show your support on the dancefloor at their fundraiser event at P Town on Sat., April 8, where XC-17 will perform alongside Rojo, Yessi, Indigooov, and Gusto. click to enlarge Photo: Natalie Lopez Gines Daniel Gines, aka DG Deep DG Deep Daniel Gines’ life is a testament to the question that fellow New Yorker Nas posed in “The World is Yours” on Illmatic: “Whose world is this? / The world is yours.” Since being released from prison at age 24, Gines, who raps under the name DG Deep, has taken life into his own hands. On his latest single “Real Deep,” he proclaims his mantra: “To teach the youth the truth that’s absolute / A birth of a nation I’m taking them back to roots / We strapped in boots I swear that’s the last excuse / Tired of going to funerals dressed in blackened suits.” The cautionary stories in Gines’ music trace his life from Brooklyn to a Georgia prison, to working on steam boilers at industrial power plants. His lyrics are indefatigable, both in their intensity and affection, like in “One Love,” an affectionate ode to his fiancée. Now in Pittsburgh, he’s turning his long-time penchant for old-school rap into music of his own. Gines has a discerning ear for wordplay and tight hooks that flow across lines, skills he showed off at Next Level Stanza, a recent live performance at Kelly Strayhorn Theater. On Sun., April 16, he will take his rhymes back to his hometown of Brooklyn, where he’ll perform in front of Atlantic Records as part of the Dreams 2 Reality competition event.

Hardcore? Shoegaze? These up-and-coming Pittsburgh acts catch ’em all By Eli Enis click to enlarge Photo: Ethan Harkness Eyewash One of the most definitive rock music developments of the 2020s thus far has been the near-total border collapse between hardcore, grunge, and shoegaze. The post-lockdown hardcore boom has catapulted underground acts including Turnstile and Knocked Loose into 4,000-cap venues and spurred an international groundswell of DIY-level bands and thriving local scenes in cities like Pittsburgh. Simultaneously, the long-niche shoegaze genre has experienced a remarkable explosion in popularity among Gen-Z listeners, who’ve made shoegaze OGs Slowdive, ’gazey alt-metal greats Deftones, and a slew of younger acts the soundtrack of TikTok. On the same app, 2010s-era grunge torchbearers like the Stone Temple Pilots-y Superheaven and the U.K. flannel-donners Basement (think Oasis via Sunny Day Real Estate) have recently had songs go viral. None of these movements are happening independently of one another. While groups like the post-hardcore Quicksand, shoegazey Swervedriver, and Top 40 nu-metallers Linkin Park previously existed in separate artistic worlds, all of those sounds are colliding in the 2020s. The bands emerging from that genre-agnostic landscape — Fleshwater, Narrow Head, and Soul Blind, to name a few national acts — are blurring hardcore, metal, and alt-rock into a new idiom that's been coined “nu-gaze,” “grunge-gaze,” or just plain “hardcore-adjacent” music, depending on who you ask. Call it what you want, but what matters is that in 2024, that sound — or more specifically, that cluster of micro-sounds with a shared creative ethos — has landed in Pittsburgh. Three local acts in particular, screamo-and-synth-pop-inflected grunge-gazers Eyewash, reverb-addled hardcore trio Spiral, and the Mudhoney-but-moshy outfit Tough Cuffs, have released music this year that feels tapped into the same national zeitgeist — even if their members don’t exactly see themselves as kindred spirits. “Every band from the ‘Seattle grunge scene’ says they were doing things separate from each other,” Eyewash drummer Jack Wells tells City Paper. “And the more music we play, the more I realize that those bands were telling the truth. Let the music critic do the historicizing process and decide what was and wasn’t a scene.” OK, bet: This is absolutely a scene. Spiral, Eyewash, and Tough Cuffs all played together at the Smiling Moose last month, where the latter band were co-celebrating their EP release with Pittsburgh hardcore stompers Princess. In the one month prior, Spiral and Eyewash gigged together twice, including a show opening for Soul Blind, the aforementioned upstate New Yorkers bringing the grunge-core sound across the country. Spiral and Tough Cuffs presently have moshier bodies of work than Eyewash, who only brought explicit hardcore influence into their sound with the bone-snapping April single, “Bound.” However, Eyewash are opening for NYHC vets Gorilla Biscuits at Preserving Underground next month, further entrenching themselves in the Pittsburgh hardcore scene, as opposed to the local shoegaze habitat. &amp;lt;a href=\"https://eyewashpgh.bandcamp.com/track/bound\"&amp;gt;Bound by eyewash&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; That's partially because the 412 doesn’t really have one of the latter right now, at least not to the degree that Pittsburgh currently has two (possibly three, if we’re getting really granular) concurrent hardcore scenes. Feeble Little Horse went from Oakland basements to Coachella stages in less than two years, and they took an 11-month hiatus in the middle of that period, effectively nixing the potential for a scene of imitators to be ushered in under their wing. Other local ’gazers like Gaadge and Blinder, who both play more straightforward shoegaze than Feeble Little Horse, have put out solid records within the last year, but neither band feel like they're echoing back the sound of any national trends within the genre. In fairness, Eyewash aren’t either, and tagging them a “shoegaze” band doesn’t even feel accurate. The five-piece (including one, formerly two, members of the late Pittsburgh screamo act Shin Guard) formed early on in the pandemic and released their self-titled debut EP last March. Across eyewash’s five cuts, chilly synths and ghastly reverb swells waft atop the stoic drum thwacks and chugging industrial-metal guitars, while co-vocalists Alex Walsh and Rachel Hines allow their mournful coos to envelope the in-between. “Spinning” and “Kaleidoscope” are deliriously hooky and alluringly atmospheric synth-pop standouts, but the heavy drums and metallurgic guitars insinuate that Eyewash are holding back a ferocious side. They let that beast out on “Bound,” an alternately bouncing, plodding, and tower-crumbling banger that sounds like post-metal/shoegaze ear-destroyers Holy Fawn one minute and grunge-gaze stewards Fleshwater the next. Wells says that Eyewash are “just writing songs based on what feels right,” so it’s unclear whether their next release will sound exactly like “Bound.” In addition to art-pop mysteriosos Dean Blunt and Jai Paul, one of Eyewash’s biggest influences is Coaltar of the Deepers, the eclectic Japanese band whose prolific body of work flits between noisy shoegaze, gnashing metal, and maudlin synth-pop. If Eyewash are committed to being even half as genre-leaping as their heroes, then predicting where they’ll end up next isn’t worth the effort. But for now, grunge-gaze it is. click to enlarge Photo: Abigail McNatt Eyewash live at Preserving Underground in New Kensington, Pa. Spiral and Tough Cuffs are more overtly hitched to that sound. The former sound like an exact combination of grunge revivalists Superheaven and hardcore noise-makers GEL — with a hearty sprinkling of Deftones-y alt-metal for extra flavor. Spiral formed in 2023 and just dropped their four-song debut last month. Opener “Twisted By Design” comes crashing out the gate with hardcore power chords that clobber as much as they clang. The riffs themselves are crudely menacing, but the guitar is awash in bleary-eyed chorus and reverb effects, making the distorted resonance of each stroke spill over from one measure to the next, creating a sort of poor-man’s shoegaze flood. Devin Gainar’s vocals are gravelly and spiteful, relaxing into a nasally yawp during the chorus and then tensing into a fiery bark when the hardcore breakdown arrives. On the even heavier “Postal,” Gainar’s shouts come unhinged from the straight punk rhythm and briefly adopt a nu-metal swing, particularly when Gainar yowl-raps before the mosh chug like his foot’s caught in a beartrap. The breakdown of “Postal” in particular sounds like 10 glass vases shattering in rapid succession. The shardy guitar effects give the sledgehammering riff an inorganic intensity that’s a clear break from ’90s sensibilities. Meanwhile, “Sunshine” sounds like Failure crossed with Linkin Park (who they name as an influence), and the EP’s strongest track on a sheer songwriting level, “Empty Skin,” is a defeated power-ballad that wouldn’t sound out of place on Eighteen Visions’ Obsession. Spiral guitarist John Cantwell mentions that the Texas alt-metallers Bleed (featuring members of Narrow Head) are their single biggest inspiration. Both bands are finding common ground in the liminal spaces between alt-metal, post-hardcore, and grunge, with Spiral having the more purebred hardcore influence of the two. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Spiral Pittsburgh \"dreamy hardcore\" band Spiral In that sense, Spiral are the perfect midpoint between Eyewash and Princess, who recently invited Cantwell onstage for a riotous guest spot during a mosh-filled Mr. Roboto show. Princess don’t have any grunge or ’gaze in their sound, but they do have a couple breakdowns with a nu-metal bounce in their repertoire. And like Spiral, one of their biggest influences is the New Jersey hardcore slashers GEL, who throw a disorienting smear of reverb on their singer’s voice to give it a cave-echo resonance. Spiral instead keep the effect limited mostly to their guitars, but they share Princess’s — and by extension, much of modern-day hardcore’s — curiosity with spray-painting alt-rock colors over hardcore canvasses that are traditionally kept black-and-white. “We were going to see groups like Tough Cuffs, Princess, and Eyewash play before we formed our band,” Cantwell says of Spiral’s relation to their scene-mates. “Now that we are playing shows ourselves, we absolutely feel a kinship. We consider all of them to be friends and inspirations. We share similar influences, and feel as a result that our music is appealing to similar audiences.” Tough Cuffs didn’t get back to City Paper for comment, so we don’t know their influences for sure, but we can certainly infer who some of their muses are. The band’s 2021 and 2022 releases sound like beer-battered punk ’n roll, and therefore feel like proto versions of the band they grew into on last year’s Bliss Point and this year’s even better All Dogs Go to Heaven EP. On the new set of tunes in particular, Tough Cuffs clomp and thrash their way through beefy grunge rippers that routinely flare up into gnashing hardcore passages with strained growls and bludgeoning grooves. The walloping conclusion to “Feel” has that Deftones-y, Quicksand-y pogo that Soul Blind and Bleed are so fond of, while “One Track Mind” is just a sludgy hardcore ripper. &lt;a href=\"https://toughcuffs.bandcamp.com/album/all-dogs-go-to-heaven\"&gt;All Dogs Go to Heaven by Tough Cuffs&lt;/a&gt; Their song “Growing Pains” is far catchier, boasting a raggedy, angsty punk chorus and churning guitars that would fit snugly on a playlist with Title Fight’s “Secret Society.” Especially during that song’s frothy verse riffs, Tough Cuffs are one reverb pedal away from emanating Dinosaur Jr.-esque shoegaze squalls. Instead, their blue-flame feedback gives the songs a noise-rock burn, tipping Tough Cuffs toward a Pittsburgh act like the fractious guitar-squealers Gundy, but retaining enough post-grunge melody in their choruses to ensure Touch and Go Records won’t come knocking. Grunge-core, grunge-gaze, post-post-hardcore — there really isn't a neat descriptor that applies to Tough Cuffs, Eyewash and Spiral. That's because all three bands are making music in an era when genres are borderless and 45 years worth of punk iterations are available for bands like these to mix and match. Like Wells said, if you truly zoom in on the idealized conformity of the early-’90s Seattle grunge scene, then you’ll spot as many differences as there are similarities between the bands. But what was true about that Pacific Northwest coalition remains so today in Pittsburgh: There’s something in that Allegheny water.

Princess, one of the buzziest (and best) young bands in the Pittsburgh hardcore scene, occupy the middle path: They're like that meme of the little girl asking, “¿Porque no los dos?” Princess’s second EP, Wishes for an Untimely Demise (independently released on April 12), seamlessly merges feral hardcore punk with bloody-knuckle, metallic hardcore. Face-ripping standout “Traer Un Arma” (Spanish for “bring a gun”) oscillates between fast sprints designed to spark two-stepping and chuggy breakdowns that offer the karate-mosh warriors a chance to show off. Guitarist Noah Sommers’ riffs are barbed and metallic, but unlike his previous band, the metalcore manglers Cutting Ties, his simple chord progressions in Princess’ songs are influenced by his lifelong love of Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys. Still, he and his bandmates — vocalist Mel Kennelly, bassist Zach Bird, and drummer Jordan Braverman — aren’t shy about signaling their taste for heavier fare. “We want to show that we’re not afraid to put ass-beater riffs in punk songs,” Sommers says, smiling. click to enlarge Princess logo Princess’ self-titled debut EP, released in Feb. 2023, was lighter on its feet. It nodded to the blown-out hardcore of their elder contemporaries in Scowl and GEL, bands that Sommers and Kennelly say they were excited to channel when they started Princess, which began, as their not-so-tough name lets on, as a sort of half-joke in summer 2022. But things quickly got serious when they realized people were excitedly coming out to their first few shows to mosh and headbang — months before they even had any music out. Since then, Princess has played all over Pittsburgh, opening for their hardcore heroes GEL, mathcore weirdos The Callous Daoboys, grindcore goofballs Escuela Grind, and virtually every other type of band under the hardcore umbrella. They’ve had a lot of fun making a name for themselves, but they also had good reason to go “heavier” and “angrier” on Wishes. Kennelly says she had some “really bad weeks and months” over the last year that spilled out into these new songs, several of which get highly personal. Then there was their record label schism. Many months after signing with the Connecticut-based Crimewave Records, the label head began telegraphing his militantly pro-Zionist politics in the days following the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. Princess’s leftist ideologies — which Kennelly calls “a huge part” of the band — were already apparent in the anti-police lyrics of their first EP, which were largely inspired by the injustices addressed by the Black Lives Matter protests. The band’s own pro-Palestinian beliefs were completely at odds with Crimewave’s, and fortunately, they were able to negotiate a swift split that Kennelly’s relieved to say “wasn’t messy.” The incident encouraged Princess to remain independent until they find the perfect label home. In the meantime, every facet of the Princess operation is DIY. Sommers records and produces their music in practice spaces and basements, and the band books all its own shows in and out of town. They’ve already played gigs in Ohio, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. At the latter show, they made friends with Chris Cesarini of notable Boston hardcore band Street Power and oi-core miscreants Conservative Military Image, who lends his yells to Wishes’ feisty title-track. That’s a pretty big get for a Pittsburgh hardcore band not even two years old. Sommers, Bird, and Braverman have all been playing in bands together since high school, but every achievement — and hiccup — is an exciting new experience for Kennelly. Princess is her first-ever band, and on Wishes, especially, it sounds like she’s unleashing a lifetime’s worth of pent-up rage when she screams about the personal and political trials of her everyday life experience. Like many musicians who get vulnerable on the mic, Kennelly likens Princess to a form of therapy, and in between her righteously anti-cop, anti-abuser invectives, she also finds space to direct the rage inward. “Princess,” Wishes’ eponymous opener, hurls the diss, “you’re nothing but a fucking Princess,” into the mirror, cheekily flipping the band’s own anthem into a self-depracative dig. “Everybody, even us, can be little princesses sometimes,” Kennelly admits. click to enlarge Photo: courtesy of Evan Mulgrave Princess On “Relentless,” she shouts, “my body, my life, my rules,” which she describes as a two-pronged rallying cry: “A mixture between pro-choice [messaging] and either mine or anyone else’s experience with sexual assault.” In “Traer Un Arma,” Kennelly growls, “Bring a knife to a gun fight and you’ll fucking see / How your life means nothing / And you beg and you plead.” That might read like the prototypical hardcore revenge fantasy, but in this case, Kennelly is actually one looking down the barrel of the gun. “I felt like I was the one bringing the knife,” she says of the event that inspired that rage-stricken song. Her second-person perspective offers a fresh angle on a mode of interpersonal conflict that's been well-tread across 40 years of first-person hardcore lyricism. It’s subtleties like that — in conjunction with their not-so-subtly raucous sound — that make Princess feel like they could be the city’s next great hardcore export. They have plans to (hopefully) tour later this year, but for now, they'll keep racking up full-circle moments in Pittsburgh. Kennelly says opening for GEL last summer at the Mr. Roboto Project was a “fever dream,” and, on May 13, they’ll return to that venue to open for Spy and Jivebomb — two of the hypest bands in American hardcore and ones that Princess happen to hold in high regard. “Those are the bands we literally said we were listening to while we were [writing our first EP],” Sommers says, shaking his head in disbelief. “It’s kind of surreal.” &amp;amp;lt;a href=\"https://princesshc.bandcamp.com/track/wishes-for-an-untimely-demise-feat-chris-cesarini\"&amp;amp;gt;WISHES FOR AN UNTIMELY DEMISE (feat.

Planet Hollywood, launched in 1991, welcomed guests to dine among props and costumes from classic and blockbuster films. Then there was Hard Rock Cafe, a similar concept centering on music. Each location had its walls festooned with signed instruments, tour posters, and other items from famed rock and blues musicians. This venture, launched in London and officially franchised in 1982, featured stages for live performers alongside its dining rooms. This applies to the Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square, opened in 2002 with \"an industrial ceiling and exposed-brick stage,\" indoor seating for 200, a seasonal outdoor patio, and an 80-seat private indoor patio room \"overlooking the dancing fountain,\" according to the location's website. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Pittsburgh's Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square Station Square will soon lose its Hard Rock, ending over two decades of hosting live music that ranged from tribute bands to local acts. The location will close on Feb. 13 after Brookfield Properties, the New York-based firm that owns the property, reportedly decided not to renew the restaurant and performance venue's lease. The location will go out doing what it has always done, serving patrons a combination of comfort food (including its award-winning burger) and music. On Mon., Feb. 3, hip hop artists Sean Ski, Marly, and Jody Graves will present Final Farewell, a show honoring the venue's contribution to the local music scene. Sean Ski, whose real name is Sean Lewandowski, tells Pittsburgh City Paper that the Hard Rock played an important role in his career. \"Performing at the Hard Rock has helped me greatly in getting my feet wet and in developing a local fan base,\" he says. \"I felt like it was only right to do a finale show there, not only in celebration and gratitude for my own personal experiences with so many memories created there but to pay homage to everyone both past and present who has played a role in making it such a special spot.\" He adds that he had a \"great relationship with all of the staff at Hard Rock, adding that they \"have always been so kind and helpful\" to him and his team. \"Many of the employees have also purchased merchandise of mine and have become supporters, which means a lot to me, especially being that my performances there had that kind of positive impact.\" click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Sean Ski Sean Ski Ski says the venue allowed him to open for hip-hop artists Afroman and Dizzy Wright, rock artists like Chris Barron of the Spin Doctors, and \"good friend and fellow Connellsville native\" Scott Blasey of The Clarks. Ski adds that, after completing his second international tour in Canada with Chris Webby, he had his first headlining show at Hard Rock in August 2024, which he says \"was a success and very encouraging.\" The closure of Hard Rock speaks more to the slow death of Station Square brought on by Brookfield deciding to sell the entertainment complex, than a lack of commitment. Over the pandemic, as other restaurants and performance venues closed permanently, Hard Rock survived COVID-19 and reopened. It also outlived two other anchor Station Square businesses, Buca di Beppo and Joe's Crab Shack, that shuttered in 2024. Part of Hard Rock Station Square's longevity perhaps lies in its eclectic events. Besides touring musicians, the venue hosted nostalgic acts like the '90s boy group LFO, Broadway musical singalongs, and tribute bands, as well as a Match Gayme event with drag queens and Giselle Fetterman, a CP-sponsored Battle of the Bands in 2018, and, more recently, a DJ convention party. CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Snowdonia on stage at Hard Rock Cafe during CP’s Battle of the Bands Ski believes one of the biggest reasons Hard Rock has been a staple in the Pittsburgh music scene is because it provided \"a consistent space for the national, middle-tier artists, and local aspiring acts to perform.\" \"There’s been a primary focus on the A-level musicians getting booked in the bigger venues like [PPG Paints Arena], Starlake Amphitheater, PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium, [et cetera], which is great, but with so many other smaller venues closing down the past so many years, the options are now very limited for other national touring artists and bands as well as local musicians to secure a venue to play a show,\" he says. \"The Hard Rock, along with a short list of other local music venues, have been that outlet.\" His statement speaks to smaller local venues that have closed over the past several years, including Rex Theater and, more recently, Club Cafe. As Hard Rock prepares its exit, Ski would like to see the property be put to good use. *My hope is that the space is utilized as another music venue/restaurant or at least something in the arts,\" he says. \"Our local music scene needs a resurgence, and it starts with more performance location possibilities. In general, I’d like to see Station Square as a whole return to prominence.\"Final Farewell with Sean Ski, Marly, and Jody Graves. 8 p.m. Doors at 7 p.m. Hard Rock Cafe. 230 W.

I can never get enough of the show no matter how many times I view it in its entirety.” The realization moved Ski to write \"Juiced Up,\" a tribute song to the multi-award-winning series about organized crime and therapy. A scene between two of the main characters, Tony and Carmela Soprano, involving Tropicana orange juice is one of Ski’s favorite scenes in the show, and it inspired him to write a chorus about it. After finding production and a hook, he composed the verses for the song. Ski says he wanted to recruit another big Sopranos fan to feature on the song and had recently discovered Chris Webby’s love for the show. “Working with him was seamless,\" says Ski. \"He’s an incredible lyricist. He knew exactly what I was looking for and really delivered.” The song is directly aimed at Sopranos superfans like Ski and Webby and includes samples of dialogue from Tony, played by late actor James Gandolfini. “I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make direct references for the core fanbase of The Sopranos along with having a video I would edit with all of the show clips, matching the lyrics,” Ski says. This is the first time Ski has written a song based on a television show and was excited at the chance to show his versatility with the release of \"Juiced Up.\" “I feel like [diehard fans] are the only ones who would catch some of the metaphors being used as opposed to the average viewer,” Ski says. “You obviously can enjoy this song too without any knowledge of the show, but if you’re an adult and of age then I hope this song encourages you to go start the show. If it were just some mob series, I would personally have no interest.

Many, including his dim review of the Atlanta Braves’ new stadium complex and his “old world” takedown of Little Italy Days, have racked up thousands of likes. It was “The Condo Song” (180,000 likes on Instagram) that did it for me. I frequently bike through the Strip District to get to work, and I often get “dorm room for adults!” stuck in my head as I pedal past The District apartments along Waterfront Place. Saxboybilly18 is actually Bill Stiteler. As it happens, Stiteler has a family connection to Pittsburgh City Paper — his dad, Ted Hoover, was a theater critic for City Paper and its predecessor In Pittsburgh. “[I] grew up with that paper always at the house,” Stiteler recalls. A South Side native who remembers hearing the shift bell ring at the Jones & Laughlin steel mill, Stiteler eventually moved to New York City for a decade. Circumstances then took him to, of all places, Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, before he moved back home to Pittsburgh in 2024 for a simple reason: “to stop drinking.” Fittingly, CP met Stiteler in Brother André’s Café, a welcoming Lower Hill spot in the spacious Epiphany Roman Catholic Church basement. “I'm used to being in another sort of meeting in church,” Stiteler quips over coffee. Heavy drinking in New York became dangerous drinking in Mongolia, where “vodka was, like, 80 cents for a jug.” Following a stint in rehab here in Pennsylvania, Stiteler, now 10 months sober, has packed out his schedule with not only recovery meetings, but also with Pittsburgh sports, cultural events — and plenty of time editing videos for TikTok and Instagram. “I started making videos again because I’d done comedy in New York for seven years, but I stopped in 2016 when the drinking started to pick up,” Stiteler says. He had a popular Vine account at the time, as well. “It goes hand and hand, my recovery and these videos.” Under the Saxboybilly18 moniker, Stiteler has been churning out keenly observed videos that both celebrate and roast Pittsburgh culture. The process began when Stiteler started going to Pirates games “to have routine and structure.” “The account was originally just all Pirates, because they’ve got the Ballpark Pass,” he recalls. “I just started going to every single game.” Eventually, that included games in other cities. “I was like, You know what? Fuck it. I'll go to Milwaukee.” Stiteler used money from selling thrift items to fund the cheapest travel options he could find. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Saxboybilly18 click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson “I would fly the cheapest flight possible, I’d get the cheapest Airbnb possible, and I’d just ride a bike around. You can travel pretty inexpensive,” he says. He also traveled to Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and, of course, metro Atlanta, with its train-to-a-bus ballpark in Cobb County and “The Atlanta Braves Song.” I was interested in the urbanism angle this and other Saxboybilly18 videos seem to have. Beyond his critiques of Atlanta or the Strip, Stiteler has posted numerous videos exploring Pittsburgh from the saddle of his e-bike — always wearing a helmet, and usually in Pirates gear. He’s also spotlit Pittsburgh’s numerous city steps. It turns out Stiteler doesn’t drive. “I don't really like cars. I like cities and communities, and that's why I lived in New York,” he says. “The hack with Pittsburgh is the e-bike,” he says. “I don't even take the bus anymore; I just e-bike everywhere.” That has fueled an appreciation for the ways Pittsburgh does and doesn’t meet the needs of the 20% of Pittsburghers without cars. “Everything you need shouldn't require getting into a car and driving somewhere. Driving in a one-ton machine to go down the street to pick up a Mountain Dew, that's just ridiculous,” Stiteler says. “Things should be commutable or within walking distance,” he adds. “And I get that we're more sprawled out in Pittsburgh, but that's still achievable here.” These critiques are all grounded in “how freaking unique and awesome our city is. I mean, San Francisco has really amazing views, but wouldn’t Pittsburgh be right up there?” As the 2024 Pirates season sputtered to a close, Stiteler biked to Pittsburgh’s Central Park, the American Eagle headquarters, and one of Allegheny Goatscape’s sites. “Slowly, over time, you'll see [my videos] stopped going from being Pirates-centric to bigger, broader topics, and that's where the account’s at,” Stiteler says. Other recent videos include a tongue-in-cheek promo for Carnegie Mellon University and an unvarnished review of the legacy of Henry Clay Frick. He has further Saxboybilly18 videos in the works. Some, such as the recent Frick foray, have incorporated AI music made with Suno. Stiteler still writes all of the lyrics himself and spends lots of time fine-tuning things. “It's still kind of a mess,” he says, “but you gotta learn how to do it.” He says he’s “not a musician” (the Saxboybilly18 moniker is an inside joke Stiteler chuckles is “not worth explaining”), but, rather, a comedian, and is happy to talk about his process with viewers. Longer-term, he’s hopeful that the traction online will keep him busy and perhaps lead to opportunities to perform. He has over 10,000 followers on Instagram and nearly 4,000 on TikTok, such that Saxboybilly18 now has fans outside the ’Burgh, and Stiteler won’t rule out a future live performance. “My dream would be to, when I follow the Pirates on the road, get a small little 100-seater” to perform in, Stiteler says. “There are these weird pockets of cities like Cincinnati [and] Atlanta [where] the videos have done really well … It's pretty cool.” Following his struggles with addiction, Stiteler seems to be in a good place as we wrap our interview and he heads toward his e-bike in the October sunshine. “I just started doing it six months ago. So it's crazy. I thought I was gonna lose the skill,” he says, remembering his Vine days. “It's cool that I was able to pick it up again.” Slideshow From the bootleg to the bizarre, here's the most yinzerific Strip District merchandise Click to View 32 slides Video View this post on Instagram A post shared by saxboy: 🎵stupid songs, 🇺🇸travel, & 🌃Pittsburgh (@saxboybilly18) View this post on Instagram A post shared by saxboy: 🎵stupid songs, 🇺🇸travel, & 🌃Pittsburgh (@saxboybilly18) Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Arts + Entertainment, Saxboybilly18, Pittsburgh, Instagram, TikTok Related Content This British TikToker is Pittsburgh's biggest fan By Kate Oczypok Jan 9, 2025 Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

The floppy-haired, blonde, 20-something U.K. native has dedicated his account to Pittsburgh, a city he adopted after trading soccer for a life on the road. Szep, who first came to the U.S. to play soccer, had an agent in England who handled his recruiting process. According to Szep, the agent “did not do a good job” and sent him to the University of Findlay in Ohio. Feeling out of place, the Cleethorpes, England native created his own business helping high school soccer players get recruited. Szep tells Pittsburgh City Paper that Findlay \"wasn’t particularly bad,\" it just wasn’t what he expected. He wasn’t a fan of the rural area or the lack of international students. “If I was aware of these things before I went, I wouldn’t have gone, but my actual experience at the school wasn’t terrible,” he says. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Harrison Szep Harrison Szep during his appearance on STAR 100.7 Szep then embarked on a nomadic lifestyle (he’s been to 27 states), trying out different places for a month each. Szep and his girlfriend, Kiaja Bledsoe, whose workplace has a branch in Pittsburgh, rented an Airbnb for one month. After just three weeks, he decided to stay in the city until May. He says the city has been the friendliest place he’s stayed thus far. “I’m not saying other places weren’t friendly, but here, it’s just on another level,” he says. “The people have embraced me and taken me in like their own family.” His TikTok has been “flooded with positivity,” he says. Many call Szep Pittsburgh’s biggest fan and talk about how much they enjoy seeing Pittsburgh through his eyes. Szep tried Aiello’s pizza and got a comment on the post from the heiress to the Aiello pizza throne, Nina Aiello, herself. He tried pierogies for the first time, calling his first bite, “weird, like you’re biting into air, then you’re greeted with a bit of mashed tatey.” He cites The Grand Concourse and Ritual House as his two favorite local restaurants. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Harrison Szep Harrison Szep and girlfriend, Kiaja Bledsoe, at Light Up Night in Downtown Pittsburgh Szep was declared an honorary yinzer when, on Dec. 8, the Steelers invited him to his first NFL game versus the Browns. He was even gifted an on-field pass and snapped a selfie with running back and kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson. Szep attended Light Up Night and posted his reaction to the tree and skating rink at PPG Place. Multiple radio stations reached out to Szep and he “just picked a random one,” ultimately going with STAR 100.7. He also collaborated with the University of Pittsburgh, attending a women’s volleyball game. “I’m getting all these different Pittsburgh-based companies reaching out to me, and it’s all very new,” he says. “Pittsburgh’s people are the absolute best thing about Pittsburgh.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags New Media, Harrison Szep, TikTok Related Content TikToker Joe Long's mind has swirled with addiction and psychosis, but now, there's “Don and Deb\" By Kate Oczypok Nov 13, 2024 Saxboybilly18 boasts and roasts Pittsburgh in viral videos on sports, city life — and sobriety By Colin Williams Oct 30, 2024 Move over, Pittsburgh Dad, “Cig Mom” is here By Kate Oczypok Nov 29, 2023 2023's Best Places to Buy TikTok Followers: Increase Your Reach Sponsored By Likes SMM Feb 10, 2023 Latest in New Media An interactive app by a local artist seeks to preserve Pittsburgh’s Black history By Tara Fay Coleman Jan 29, 2025 Stuck inside?

Joe Long wasn’t born in Pittsburgh, but you’d hardly know it. The newly-minted TikTok star was born in Huntsville, Ala. and moved to Pittsburgh at age 9. He went to Brashear High School and loved watching sketch comedy like Saturday Night Live and Mad TV as a teen. Now, he’s pursuing his own comedic endeavor that involves putting on a delightfully thick Pittsburgh accent — something you may have seen him do on social media. Introducing Don and Deb “I’ve always, ever since the Myspace days, made short videos with my friends, like when YouTube first came out,” Long tells Pittsburgh City Paper. More recently, though, Long is best known for his TikTok channel, @joelongtok, where his characters, Don and Deb, have gone viral in recent weeks. Many call their back-and-forth soap opera-style story “The Yinz and the Restless.” Don is an unassuming roofer with an undying love for Deb, a woman who loves her “crahn and cokes” when out on the “tahn.” The skits often involve Don trying to get Deb to go “dahn the haus.” If you aren’t sure what that means, take a look at how Long uses the phrase in his videos, and you’ll eventually see why it’s such a big step for Deb. “I’ve known Dons and Debs throughout my life, and they seem like such Pittsburgh names, so one day I just made a video,” Long says. “The first one was ‘Pittsburgh relationships be like’ and I didn’t even wear a wig yet.” Long now wears a wig for his Deb character, but while filming this first Don and Deb video, it was just him with his glasses on for Don and off for Deb. “I was like, ‘I guess I’ll make this a thing,’” he says. “Now there are people dressing up as Deb for Halloween and carving pumpkins with my sayings on them.” Don and Deb also frequently talk about heading “dahn the lahnge.” Long explains that the lounge they’re referring to is a real place: the Boulevard Lounge in Brookline. “That was my old bar back when I drank,” Long says. “I used to work in the kitchen there 15 years ago.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Joe Long at home. Long recently visited the establishment, and the manager was grateful for all the newfound publicity. “She said they had people from Youngstown, Ohio come in for Wednesday Wing Night” — typically Don’s guys night “aht” while Deb laments never getting asked to attend. Long recently did a TikTok ad for Primanti Bros. as Don and Deb. He currently has 416,000 TikTok followers and 23.4 million likes on his posts. “It was always my dream ever since I was a little kid that I wanted to do something in the entertainment industry,” he says. “I thought maybe a comedic role in a movie or something like that, but I know it’s a lofty dream—now I’m kind of thinking maybe it’s possible, you know?” Speaking Out on Mental Health and Addiction Struggles Long’s road to fame was not an easy one. He has been open on his social media accounts about his struggles with mental health and addiction. He says he was addicted to everything, “literally most of the drugs that exist.” He was what those in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous call a “garbage can.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Joe Long at home. “While I personally may be 100% sober, I’m an advocate for harm reduction and medically-assisted treatment,” he says. “I don’t knock anyone’s path; it’s about quality of life to me.” Some of the first stories he would post on his TikTok were psychosis stories because Long is schizoaffective. “From 26 to 32, pretty much annually I would go into a psychosis,” he says. He was unmedicated and misdiagnosed from age 13 to 30. “They thought I was just bipolar, but I’m actually schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, so when you don’t address the schizophrenia aspect, you know you’re not taking the right meds,” he adds. “I needed an anti-psychotic.” Now 37, Long is coming up on his five-year anniversary without a psychosis. After getting his schizoaffective disorder controlled, Long struggled with agoraphobia. He says it stemmed from fear of backlash from things he said and did while in psychosis. Long was homeless for a period, including walking along the Pacific Coast Highway in California for six months. “I was just wandering, literally sleeping in bushes and eating out of trash cans,” he says. “It gets really dark, and that’s why I take my meds. Even though I get some bad side effects, I have to take them. I’m not willing to risk it.” One major side effect Long experiences is dystonia, a neurological disorder that can cause involuntary muscle contractions. “Your tongue twists in your mouth, your eyes roll back in your head, and it kind of looks like a seizure,” he says. “You’re totally conscious through it and it’s very painful but I only get it in my eyes, so like, I’ll just be blind for an hour.” Through what Long calls his bad times, he met some of what he nicknamed “Earth angels,” or people who helped him out along the way. He specifically credited House of Hagar in Wheeling, W.Va., saying without them, he would have never received his proper diagnosis. Long, who now lives with his mother, says that during the height of his struggles with agoraphobia, he only left his house about 20 to 25 times in four-and-a-half years. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Joe Long at home. “Overcoming my agoraphobia is my proudest accomplishment,” he says. “I couldn’t even step out in front of my house.” Long used exposure therapy to work his way up to leaving his house for longer periods of time, visiting his grandmother who he hadn’t seen in 15 years, and then helping one of his sisters move. He was riddled with anxiety for the entire experience, he says, but still did it because it was for her. “I mean it’s one thing if you want to be a homebody, but I’m a social person, so I was in hell. It wasn’t fun to me,” he says. “I was really struggling, which is why I started making videos.” Celebrating His Newfound Fame Long credits his sister with suggesting he hop on TikTok. Since then, he calls making his videos “therapeutic.” His two sisters are still encouraging him as he navigates his newfound fame, with one buying him a celebratory 400,000 followers shrimp lo mein with some candles in it, since Long isn’t a big fan of cake. Despite having what he calls a “lifelong identity crisis” well into his 20s, now that Pittsburgh and TikTok are fully embracing him, Long finally feels like he’s right where he’s meant to be. “For many years, I always felt like the outcast because I’m not originally from here,” he says. “I don’t usually say yinz, I say y’all.”He’s been in Pittsburgh long enough now, though, that he finds himself slipping up and saying “haus” and “dahn” in conversations. “It made me cry when I realized I was getting so much love, that’s all I ever wanted,” he says. “It’s crazy, I still feel like I’m in a dream.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Comedy, Joe Long, Don and Deb, TikTok, Instagram Related Content This British TikToker is Pittsburgh's biggest fan By Kate Oczypok Jan 9, 2025 Saxboybilly18 boasts and roasts Pittsburgh in viral videos on sports, city life — and sobriety By Colin Williams Oct 30, 2024 3 Best Sites to Buy Instagram Likes in 2024 (Real and Safe) Sponsored By Kudometrics LLC Mar 18, 2024 Move over, Pittsburgh Dad, “Cig Mom” is here By Kate Oczypok Nov 29, 2023 Latest in Comedy Kathy Griffin took seven years to “bite and scratch” her way back, and she's coming to Pittsburgh By Kate Oczypok Oct 21, 2024 Joel Kim Booster trades Fire Island for the Steel City with Bottlerocket residency By Matt Petras Aug 13, 2024 Kevin Nealon talks caricatures, comedy, and SNL's 50th ahead of Pittsburgh shows By Kate Oczypok Aug 6, 2024 Comedian Chris Fleming is going to F around, and Pittsburgh is gonna find out By Matt Petras Jun 7, 2024 More » More Comedy All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images The Wienermobile rolls through the Strip By Mars Johnson Mar 14, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Short film Baba I'm Fine is a nuanced love letter to Pittsburgh and immigrant fathers By Rachel Wilkinson Mar 7, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

The city’s African American community has been a cornerstone of its identity, contributing to the arts, labor movements, and civil rights efforts. The Great Migration brought many Black families to Pittsburgh, where they supported the city’s industrial growth and laid the foundation for a thriving cultural scene. But urban renewal projects in the 1950s and 1960s saw the displacement of thousands of Black residents, leaving behind a fragmented cultural legacy. These waves of displacement, often masked as “beautification” or “revitalization,” have been part of a broader, troubling trend of exclusionary urban policies. Today, Pittsburgh’s Black community continues to face the challenges of gentrification, economic inequality, and the erasure of this cultural legacy. This cultural erasure motivated artist Adrian Jones to create Looking Glass, an iOS app that brings Pittsburgh’s Black past into the present through augmented reality. Jones cites writer bell hooks, specifically her work on the practice of remembering, as living “at the heart of Looking Glass.“ “Remembering can involve traveling to a site of memory, gazing at a photograph, or digging through an archive,” Jones tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “This practice acknowledges that any visit to the past has the potential to change your perspective on the present and thus influence the future.” click to enlarge The app allows users to explore historical sites in real-time, offering an interactive way to engage with a history being lost to gentrification. Adrian’s connection to the city’s history contributed greatly to the app’s creation. \"Looking Glass grew out of three core experiences,\" he shares. \"Tracing my family’s history, discovering the work of Charles 'Teenie' Harris, and actively listening to elders here in the city all formed the foundation of this work. Gaining access to these stories was like collecting fragments of myself and my people that I didn’t even know I was missing.\" This exploration coincided with witnessing the effects of gentrification on Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods. “In this context,” Jones shares, “emerged a vision of a lens that could unearth the stories that were buried in gentrified spaces.” The rapid pace of gentrification has affected many Pittsburgh neighborhoods, particularly in the East End, where long-time residents have been and continue being displaced. Cultural landmarks that once defined predominantly Black communities such as the Hill District are gradually fading. It’s not just about physical displacement; it's about a larger, more insidious erasure of cultural history, an aspect too often overlooked in the broader conversation about revitalization and urban growth. This leaves many Black residents feeling like strangers in once-familiar spaces. This isn't just about new development or economic growth — it’s about the slow but steady erasure of the culture and history that made these neighborhoods vital. \"For folks whose culture and history have long been subject to erasure, these cycles of disinvestment and displacement pose a significant threat to our collective memory and identity,\" says Jones. Adrian explains that his goal was never to elevate the future over the past but rather to bridge the two. “So much of technology is driven by a fixation with the 'future.' If there’s been any challenge in designing with the intent of bridging past and present, it’s been making peace with the resistance to this goal,” he says. \"I don’t believe in elevating the future over the past or the present. Every conception of the future contains a set of assumptions about the past, and often these are faulty or incomplete understandings. In order to realize a just and equitable future, we need to make redress for past harms, gather ancestral wisdom, and fill the gaps in our memories.\" Resisting the future-centric nature of technology makes Looking Glass a unique and necessary tool. By allowing users to engage with augmented reality, the app brings Black Pittsburgh’s history directly into the spaces being reshaped by gentrification. click to enlarge Jones shares that “in each story from Black Pittsburgh’s near and distant past, I’ve seen vibrancy, ingenuity, and enormous resilience.” “From the color palette to the language used in the story summaries, I wanted to embed celebration and reverence within Looking Glass,” he says. The stories it reveals aren’t just historical facts — they are living narratives that challenge us to reconsider the present and, by extension, the future. Jones relied on collaboration and community input while designing the app. Before writing any lines of code, he spent time with residents and experts, including Charlene Foggie-Barnett, archivist for Carnegie Museum of Art’s Charles \"Teenie\" Harris Archive; Joe Trotter, a professor of history and social justice at Carnegie Mellon University; John M. Brewer Jr., a historian and consultant for the Pittsburgh Courier archive project; University of Pittsburgh history professor Laurence Glasco; and Terri Baltimore, creator of the Black-Jewish history tour of the Hill District. “It was critical that I was able to listen and verify whether Looking Glass would provide any value to the community,” he says. \"Looking Glass is ultimately accountable to the people whose stories are represented in the archive.” Adrian highlights the importance of remembering the past in conversations about urban revitalization. “To me, terms like renewal and revitalization are charged,” he explains. “Black homes, businesses, and institutions were razed in the name of beautification and renewal. In the eyes of others, decades of disinvestment and neglect have created the present conditions for revitalization and redevelopment.” The app underscores the need for “real repair and restitution,” which many see as an urgent priority as gentrification reshapes Pittsburgh. Looking ahead, Adrian plans to expand Looking Glass with an Android release, guided tours, and an audio library with original music and oral history interviews. He expresses excitement over upgrading the app’s AR capabilities in ways that would allow users to interact more deeply with the city’s history. \"Stay tuned,\" he says, hinting at even more upcoming developments. Jones cites the work of multimedia artists Alice Yuan Zhang, Bayeté Ross Smith, and Jeffrey Yoo Warren as demonstrating what can be further explored within VR and AR spaces, and is optimistic about the potential of immersive media being used elsewhere to challenge narratives. “The kind of erasure that Looking Glass confronts is not limited by geography,” says Jones. “What I’ve observed in Pittsburgh is visible in other cities across the country and, frankly, the world. I believe it’s certainly possible to replicate Looking Glass elsewhere, and I’d love to explore that in the future.” As Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods change, Looking Glass ensures that Black Pittsburgh’s history remains visible. By connecting people to place, amplifying underrepresented narratives, and fostering community engagement, the app offers a blueprint for how technology can be used to preserve cultural memory and inspire action. Jones hopes that “folks who engage with Looking Glass are able to see that history is not lifeless or irrelevant.” For anyone concerned about the future of Pittsburgh’s Black communities, Looking Glass offers an opportunity to both remember and participate in shaping a more equitable future.

Such is the premise of The Ratchelor, a free online game that takes a rodent spin on the long-running hit ABC dating reality show. For its latest season, the game, designed by a team of new media artists out of Carnegie Mellon University, takes its rat contestants to some of Pittsburgh’s most notable landmarks. First launched by Algorat on Valentine’s Day in 2021, The Ratchelor has generated a fanbase charmed by its crudely animated rat characters and absurd sense of humor. Players create their own “ratchelor” with limited customizations, then hand out roses to the contestants with whom they’re most compatible, leading to a big final proposal. Algorat members Connie Ye, Tatyana Mustakos, Char Stiles, and Caroline Hermans tell Pittsburgh City Paper that the idea for The Ratchelor came about while the team was making “lots of rat-based games.” At the time, Hermans started hosting watch parties for The Bachelor and “had the idea to make a game inspired by it.” In the recently released third season of The Ratchelor — subtitled Rats in the City — dates occur at familiar Pittsburgh sites, including the Duquesne Incline, Phipps Conservatory, and Heinz Chapel. The Algorat team even pays tribute to its alma mater with a date at the bus stop in front of CMU’s towering “Walking to the Sky” sculpture. While the Algorat members no longer reside in Pittsburgh, they wanted to pay tribute to the city and college where they first connected. “We knew we wanted to change the environment for the latest season of The Ratchelor and brainstormed doing a city environment, and thought we’d pay homage to the city where we all met,” Algorat says in a joint statement. They add that while brainstorming which landmarks to showcase, they chose ones that would “translate well to being recognized as a background.” Algorat was founded at Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a CMU College of Fine Arts department that intentionally marries (pun intended) technology and engineering with the humanities. The studio has facilitated and funded projects similar to The Ratchelor, including a game by local multidisciplinary artist Angela Washko that delves into the misogynistic world of pick-up artists. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Algorat Still from The Ratchelor: Rats in the City “We actually all met through the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry,” says Algorat. “We were super grateful to have met there and the director at the time, Golan Levin, was an invaluable resource for providing feedback on our minigames and advice on how to proceed as an artist collective.” The Ratchelor joins the ranks of other offbeat dating sims that take a more bizarre approach to finding love. Like Algorat’s creation, the Japanese game Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings lets you play as a sentient teen pigeon finding young love at an elite school for birds. Other sims allow players to pursue terrifying creatures (Cryptid Crush and Monster Prom), or, in the case of Dream Daddy, other men, in which you play as a dad trying to meet other hot dads. Online dating sims have grown in popularity to the extent that, in 2019, KFC launched a game where you can romance a sexy version of its founder, Colonel Sanders. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Algorat Still from The Ratchelor: Rats in the City Algorat calls the reception for The Ratchelor “surprisingly positive,” adding that “some people even enjoy it enough to play through multiple times for all the endings.” Those visiting the Algorat social media channels will find fan-submitted comments, play-through videos, and art of the game’s various rats (crowd favorites include Eggsalad and Martine from season two, and Philoxena from season three). Algorat offers even more ways to interact with The Ratchelor. Users visiting the algorat.club website will find Ratchelor-themed holiday e-cards that can be sent to “someone special” and opportunities to create rat clothing or a whole new rat character. Algorat keeps the games free by collecting donations through the crowdfunding website Ko-fi. As for the future of The Ratchelor, fans can expect an expansion for the third game “with a little more content.” Algorat also plans on making new games that are “a little different” than The Ratchelor. “We usually make games for ourselves, so we’re honored that others think our games are fun, too,” says Algorat.

When I met with Cement City creators Jeanne Marie Laskas and Erin Anderson, I broke the ice by showing them the only Donora artifact I could find in my apartment — a poetry book I made as a fourth grader at Donora Elementary Center. POEMS I KNOW YOU’LL LOVE! immediately captivated them. Laskas, who began looking at it first, implored Anderson to read the poem “I Do Not Understand,” which includes such lines as “I do not understand why my haircuts are so long” and “I do not understand why brains think different.” Their reaction points to what makes the recently concluded Cement City podcast so captivating as an earnest look at a year in a town known primarily for its tragic past. “We fell in love immediately,” Laskas says of Donora. Laskas, the best-selling author behind To Obama: With Love, Joy, Anger and Hope and Concussion, and Anderson, an audio storyteller whose projects have aired on Serendipity and UnFictional, met while working for the University of Pittsburgh’s English department. The two co-wrote Cement City — Laskas hosted, and Anderson produced — and Michael Benoist, the deputy editor for The New York Times podcast The Daily, served as editor. The show was released in 10 roughly one-hour-long episodes from September through November as an Audacy Original. Their first visit to Donora several years ago came out of pure curiosity and a question: what’s the story behind this town so many people pass but never visit? They also wanted to examine a part of the Rust Belt following the first election of Donald Trump. They soon learned that Donora, the site of a 1948 smog-related tragedy that killed 20 residents and hospitalized thousands of others, fell into economic despair and had little to offer its fewer than 5,000 residents after the industry that created the environmental catastrophe left. To get embedded in the community, Laskas did something bold: she bought a house in Donora to serve as the project headquarters. For three years, Laskas and Anderson spent time reporting in the borough. Laskas asked most of the questions as Anderson typically held the microphone. Afterward, Laskas sold the house, which proved difficult. Anderson almost bought a house there as well. “It was hard to imagine leaving,” Anderson says. The team fits a lot into each episode. Anderson estimates she recorded about 850 hours of audio, and, in the finished product, it’s clear that she meticulously stitched and blended quotes, environmental sound effects, scripted narration from Laskas, and banter between the two of them as they explored the borough. click to enlarge Photo: Jeanne Marie Laskas A deli in Donora, subject of the Cement City podcast The two do not keep themselves and their perspectives at a distance — instead, they emerge as subjects in the series. They didn’t plan to include themselves as much, but Benoist said they had to after listening to some of their conversations incidentally picked up by the microphone. “He’s like, ‘This is so good, because this is the real stuff of you being in this place,’” Anderson says. “He didn’t have access to that. For him, that was this amazing window into what it actually was … He’s the one who then said, ‘You two need to be characters in this.’” The podcast has many more subjects, however. Segments with longtime church organist Arthur Fronzaglio stick with me the most — listening to him play music brought me back to the pew, and his beautiful singing voice gave me chills. The two created physical storyboards to map each subject’s role in the podcast’s overarching story. The podcast often features Mayor Don “Piglet” Pavelko and his wife DeAnne, who stuck with Laskas. “His commitment to the town was so genuine and profound,” Laskas says. “And then DeAnne, I would always say, if I lived in Donora, I would want to be DeAnne. It’s so opposite from my life. She lives in that house opposite from where she grew up and is just the happiest human being with what she has.” The description of these characters and the storytelling around them underscores the podcast’s success as a compelling piece of creative nonfiction. When the two meet a woman working at a shop in town, Laskas’ narration describes her as “having this kind of old-time librarian vibe.” She continues: “Her hair is teased up in a bouffant. But what I really notice is her skin. It’s smooth, almost preserved like she spent her whole life indoors behind this counter.” Listeners soon learn this isn’t true: the woman used to be an opera singer who once lived and performed in New York. It became clear to Laskas and Anderson that the borough appreciated the podcast. Anderson says one Donora historian texted Anderson to say he listened to the first episode twice. The mayor who left such an impression on them sent them messages they’ll never forget. “Donny’s response was almost the same every time,” Laskas says. “‘I’m weeping!’” “And he actually left a weepy voicemail,” Anderson adds.Cement City. cementcity.org Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags New Media, Audacy, Cement City, Donora Related Content Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Public Source, Powdermill Nature Reserve, Cinderlands Beer Co., and more By Morgan Biddle Apr 22, 2024 WAMO celebrates 75 years of broadcasting Black Pittsburgh By Jordan Snowden Sep 27, 2023 Best Radio Station 2023: 100.7 Star Radio Station By CP Staff Sep 20, 2023 Local radio stations run hateful anti-trans ad from far-right group By Jordana Rosenfeld Oct 17, 2022 Latest in New Media An interactive app by a local artist seeks to preserve Pittsburgh’s Black history By Tara Fay Coleman Jan 29, 2025 Stuck inside?

He did some research and spoke to the directors of the Donora Smog Museum, a small outfit dedicated to the 1948 industrial-caused disaster that impacted thousands of residents in and around the former mill town, located just an hour south of Pittsburgh. James, who now resides in North Carolina, then wrote the lyrics to \"Donora,\" combining it with music by bandmate Craig Elliot. The song is now part of Scribbles and Splashes, the new LP from Special Messages. The band’s Facebook page defines their genre as “post-alt chill punk,” their sound a mix of alt-rock and alt-country. Scribbles and Splashes, available now on most music streaming music platforms, is the duo’s first album, and “Donora” fits in perfectly with the smooth, nostalgic rock sound of the 13-track record. James sings about the current state of Donora with “And the stores are open just for show / But there’s nobody in them, no one I know.\" Although Donora may seem desolate, the lyrics, “This is my hometown, this is where I’m from,” conveys a sense of pride. The music video features footage and photos from Donora's past and present. Low-tempo music and sad lyrics accompany archival images of old-school Kennywood and a 1950s home movie of I Dream of Jeannie actress Barbara Eden when she visited the Donora Frontier Days festival. “Through the process of creating the video and talking with current residents, the experience became transformative,\" says James. \"I realized that there was a certain amount of ‘moving on’ that I needed to do. Contributing to a better future is much more productive than pining away for the past.” The video and song release coincides with the 73rd anniversary of the deadly Donora smog incident, when a temperature inversion trapped toxic smoke from the American Steel and Wire Co., Zinc Works, and coal furnaces in the valley. The smog, which lasted from Oct. 27 to Oct. 31, 1948, killed 20 people over the course of those days, both from Donora and the neighboring town of Webster, just across the Monongahela River. It darkened the town for the entire five days, and left thousands suffering from respiratory illnesses. Hospitals were overflowing, and people were left unable to breathe. The smog eventually dissolved after the mills were ordered to shut down, despite initial refusal from the people who ran it. Additionally, on the last day, a storm helped sweep much of the pollution away. Despite being dubbed by The New York Times as America’s worst air pollution disaster, the Donora smog event did little to immediately change policy. American Steel and Wire was hit with lawsuits stating that they were responsible for the deaths, which they settled, and the company continued running the facility because of how much of the town worked there. It wasn’t until 1952, when a similar smog event occurred in London, England, that the U.S. finally changed its laws concerning air pollution. The mills then closed due to worker strikes and environmental legislation. Both Donora and London were important factors in lawmakers finally recognizing air pollution as a public health issue, leading to the 1955 Air Pollution Control Act and subsequent environmental legislation being passed. Though James left Donora in 1979, he returned to his hometown a few years ago to help put his last living Donora-based relative into a personal care home. He says that relative, his aunt Dorothy Marinkovich, had lived in Donora her entire life and worked in Pittsburgh, at one point selling suits to star Pirates player Willie Stargell, and later serving as a clerk and translator at the Yugoslavian consulate. James says he hopes the song and video will make people see the beauty and soul of the town he grew up in. “Donora is geographically well placed for businesses to set up shop on the river and thrive,” he says. “The valley is so naturally beautiful — my hope is that more companies will take notice and move in.” However, he also wants people to see beyond Donora's tragic past or its potential future. “Admittedly, the song itself is the ‘usual’ sad story of an ex-mill town, but along the way, I realized that it was never the amount of stores, industries, or the population that made Donora great, but more about the heart and soul of the people that defined it as a wonderful community,\" James says. \"I will forever cherish the memories.”Special Messages specialmesages.org Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Music, Special Messages, Donora, smog, music, Scribbles and Splashes, Video Related Content Cement City captures modern life in a Rust Belt borough known for its tragic past By Matt Petras Nov 27, 2024 A week after a particularly bad stretch of air pollution, Allegheny County Health Dept. announces plans for handling next one By Hannah Lynn Jan 2, 2020 The RedWood Café, in Mount Lebanon, is a modern take on the humble lunch counter By Angelique Bamberg and Jason Roth Dec 13, 2017 Critics' Pick: Donora at Spirit By Alex Gordon Nov 29, 2017 Latest in Music 156/silence's atmospheric metalcore is reverberating far beyond Pittsburgh By Eli Enis Mar 11, 2025 Shaggy on 25 years of “It Wasn’t Me,” his BFF Sting, reggae's roots, and the Pittsburgh show that ties it all together By Kate Oczypok Feb 21, 2025 Pittsburgh’s “incredible noise machines” are changing local rock By Eli Enis Feb 5, 2025 Tim Heidecker talks Bob Dylan, songwriting, and Pittsburgh ahead of Spirit show By Matt Petras Feb 5, 2025 More » More Music All Arts+Entertainment Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 20 images Enjoy Wrestling presents Dearly Beloved at Mr. Smalls By Mars Johnson Mar 10, 2025 Trending Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi Mar 12, 2025 Pittsburgh ballplayers and mobsters once trekked to Hot Springs for spring training By David S.

For KiKi Brown, WAMO 107.3’s afternoon DJ and Assistant Brand Manager, the urban radio station’s approaching 75th anniversary is more than a celebration: it's about legacy. “No matter what changes — we changed addresses, we changed outfits — we’re still the same WAMO,” Brown tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We’re still here. We’re consistent. We went away for a little bit, but we came back, and we came back stronger.” Over the years, the Pittsburgh radio station has undergone numerous transitions, from shifting ownership — first the Black-owned Sheridan Broadcasting Corp., then Martz Communications Group, and now Audacy Pittsburgh — to different channels, hosts, and even names: WHOD, WAMO 106 Jamz, WAMO 100, and simply WAMO. But through it all, the station has continued to function as a voice for both Black Pittsburghers and the local urban community. “We are the only urban station, and have been the only urban station, in the city of Pittsburgh for 75 years, with hip-hop, R&B, soul, jazz, and gospel, and that means a lot to the Black community,” Brown says. “Because being Black, not just in this city but in this country, we’re looking for something that can represent us, be our voice, be our connection.” WAMO has done that through community engagement, concerts, events, music festivals, on-air programming like \"Stop the Music, Stop the Violence\" segments, and featuring important figures on the radio, whether they be a favorite celebrity or sports star. “Connecting with the people and letting them know what’s going on, WAMO has had that position for a very long time,” says Brown. “As far as Pittsburgh with the Black community, we were the first, and that’s a very important position to have.” Brown speaks from experience; she’s seen the evolution of WAMO over the last few decades firsthand. The station is a family legacy in its own right. Besides working her way up from an intern in the ’90s to her current on-air position, Brown’s father, Clifford “Sly Jock” Charlton, was a DJ for WAMO for over two decades beginning in the ’80s and was most recognized for playing rap and hip-hop on the radio at a time when that was unheard of in Pittsburgh. Thanks to Charlton’s work at the then 105.9 FM, WAMO was the first commercial station to regularly play the genre in the City of Bridges. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kiki Brown, afternoon DJ and Assistant Brand Manager, goes live on the air at WAMO studios on Sept. 20, 2023. “It makes me proud to know that I've seen WAMO go from one end to the other,” says Brown. “I see where it came from, with Porky Chedwick and Sir Walter Raleigh, even with my dad, from local morning show to syndication … And it's keeping up with the times. I only know one station that's been around that long, and that’s KDKA radio, and they’ve been around much longer.” WAMO’s anniversary celebrations have been ongoing for the past month and culminate with a concert at Rivers Casino Fri., Sept. 29. The show features Union DJs alongside Lah Pat, of the 2023 viral hit “Rodeo” that remixes Ginuwine’s most famous song “Pony;” and Pittsburgh’s CRAVE. Brown hopes the event will be a callback to the days when Pittsburgh’s nightlife scene was pulsating with clubs like the now-defunct Whiskey Dick’s, Chauncy’s, and Rosebud populating the Strip District, Station Square, and even Monroeville. The music curation and atmosphere of the party is meant to transport older attendees to their heyday, while allowing younger WAMO fans to get a taste of those experiences for the first, if only, time. “We may not be able to fit the same jeans, we may be a little bigger, we got kids, we got married, we’ve lost, we’ve changed, we’ve gained,” says Brown, “but for those few hours, we just want to take you back to those good times.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Kiki Brown, afternoon DJ and Assistant Brand Manager, poses for a portrait at WAMO studios on Sept. 20, 2023. WAMO’s reputation for being a reliant community station took a bit of a hit after going off-air from 2009 to 2011. Then, during the late 2010s, the station’s signal could be pretty spotty, even in the middle of the city. However, with Audacy’s acquisition of WAMO, tools like their app allow listeners to stream broadcasts no matter where they are in the United States. The station is ready to reclaim its crown as Pittsburgh’s urban community engagement platform. Brown urges listeners to “let WAMO back in,\" saying, “some people still don’t know that we’re back, that WAMO is here to stay,” she says. “We’re going to get back to the station that we were when we were 106 Jams, being more involved in the community, having that great content, great music, and just want people to remember that and embrace it … I'm praying that we can stay around for another 75 years.” Correction: Originally this article listed Ginuwine as the headliner for WAMO's celebration event. That has since changed. Union DJs will be headlining the show. We've updated the story to reflect that.

Williams, 31, has been a regular of the Caribbean team throughout his tenure with the Riverhounds, and wore the captain’s armband for the first time during a matchup against Bolivia earlier this year. Trinidad and Tobago are scheduled to play four games in the upcoming window as they seek qualification in the Gold Cup. A total of 41 teams from the Caribbean and North and Central Americas participate in this annual contest, which was most recently won by the U.S. national side. Known as the “Soca Warriors,” Trinidad and Tobago has a strong presence in the international soccer scene despite having a population only slightly larger than Allegheny County’s. The team has finished in the top five of the Gold Cup on eight occasions and qualified for the World Cup in 2006, where they were captained by former Manchester United star Dwight Yorke. The Pittsburgh Riverhounds are currently placed fourth in the USL’s eastern league, having played 12 of 34 regular season games.

Winters in Pittsburgh can be beautiful, producing idyllic scenes of snowball fights, sledding down the city's many hills, and snow falling as skaters circle the rink at PPG Place. However, in a city with as much air pollution and traffic as Pittsburgh, that crisp white powder usually turns to grey slush in a matter of days. Then comes the mud, the grime-covered vehicles (ain't nobody worrying about car washes when it's 5 degrees outside), and general wet sloppiness. In times like these, I remember a staple of my youth — the play coat. A play coat is usually a piece of kids' outerwear meant to get dirty, a beat-up garment dug out from the back of the closet when outdoor activities call. This was essential for me, a farm kid with a mom who didn't want her daughter going to school in a coat that smelled like barn stink. While the average Pittsburgher may not be working around animal excrement and greasy farm equipment, they are dealing with the aforementioned dirtiness of urban living. Why risk accidentally scraping up against your car and getting filth on your nice camel coat while running a simple errand or heading to the gym? Why pay dry cleaning bills to get the cigarette smoke and food fryer smell out of your expensive parka after hanging out at a Pittsburgh dive? (Pittsburgh City Paper Audience Engagement Specialist Stacy Rounds offered a name for the latter: the clubbing coat, aka the coat you're willing to leave behind during a debaucherous night out.) What qualifies as a play coat varies. In the fourth grade, I wore a puffer covered in white paint specks from when an errant spray can caused a minor explosion in my redneck family's garbage burner barrel. In my 20s, I had a slightly too-small blue corduroy peacoat that saw me through years of cold nights out. My current play coat — worn mainly to the gym because I don't want my goose-down parka to smell like hot ham water — is a light purple number I got for $20 at Costco. Is it the warmest coat? No. Do I care if it gets ruined or starts smelling like a pair of Fabletics leggings way past their prime? Absolutely not. In all fairness, not everyone has the means to own more than one coat, never mind one that functions as a throwaway. In an ideal world, we would all have a play coat to wear while doing yard work, helping a friend move, or visiting one of Pittsburgh's remaining smoker-friendly bars. Those sitting on an unused coat, consider rotating it back into your wardrobe (or donating it, so that someone else can have an extra). Play coats are not just for kids, and in Pittsburgh, could save you a lot of headaches and stain-treating. Staying warm is hard enough, no one should have to do it in a \"good coat\" covered in environmental filth.

The event showed children and families a fun time. There was face-painting, tattoos, ice cones, bouncy houses, food, and free haircuts. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Devyn Giovengo and Mikel Battles of Visions Attire pose for a portrait on the Hot Metal Bridge. Mikel Battles and Devyn Giovengo spearhead Visions Attire. Battles says they are more than a clothing line — they want to make a positive impact on the community. “We've all been through so much, and we've just put a lot on the line to make it happen,” Battles tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “I’m happy to call the friends who have been a part of it family at this point. We're just one big family, one big team, and we were able to create a community of just people who like to push positivity.” Visions wants to watch the community thrive. In 2017, as juniors in high school, Giovengo talked to Battles and Derek McFadden about the idea of starting a clothing line. They also had the goal of being beyond just that. “We're a group of friends trying to push the community and the world to chase their dreams and chase their visions through our art and fashion,” Giovengo says. Last year, Visions Attire gave away all 150 backpacks. This year, they planned on giving away 270 backpacks. click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy Backpacks at the second annual Youth Summer Jam click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy Giovengo says that there were fewer people in attendance this year, but they were able to make a connection with everyone and still gave away the majority of the backpacks. He says that those who attended stayed for hours, which was different than last year. “I feel like this event was more of a representation of us, because obviously both of the events were by us, but [with] this one … we were a little more hands-on. We were able to communicate with everybody. Everybody left happy.” Last year, some weren’t able to get a bookbag with such high turnout — this year, there were some backpacks left over. Giovengo went to apartment complexes, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other backpack drives to give them away. He mentions that the turnout last year and its exposure led to more people donating supplies for the event, including middle schooler Joe Dix. click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy Sno-Cones at the second annual Youth Summer Jam click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy Backpacks at the second annual Youth Summer Jam “He raised up towards $200 worth of supplies,” Giovengo says. “It's crazy, because that kid doesn't even realize how great he is already for doing so much for people that need it. He's just doing that out of the kindness of his heart … that's really the purpose of why we do this is to try to push more people to do stuff like that, and he's already doing it at such a young age.” With the positive effects on the community, other clothing brands such as DTL Apparel are also doing their own backpack giveaways. “We're actually going to donate to their backpack drives,” Battles says. “We're going to give them a couple backpacks ourselves to help them … We don't want to be the only company doing this. There's a lot of bigger companies in this world that make a lot more than us that can help the community. This is an eye-opener for them to do more to help the people who need it.” The chance to work with their friends is what both Battles and Giovengo love. Visions Attire is now expanding. There is now Visions Attire in the Philippines, where Battles has family. “I actually had some cousins that aspired to get into clothing and fashion,” Battles says. “I said, ‘what's a better way to do it than just to start out with Visions Attire?’ So there’s actually a Visions Attire Philippines currently running that's already released clothes and that's already made sales.” Battles adds that, with wages being different there, the money has helped change their lives and has helped put family members through school. As for what’s next, they look forward to dropping their fall and winter collection. Battles also mentions a fashion show and a toy drive in the winter. Battles and Giovengo say they’re grateful for the support through the past seven years. They continue to spread love through giving back. “You never really know a kid's home situation either,” Giovengo says. “There's a lot of kids that the only time they eat is at school, so there's no telling how they're getting any of their materials for school that they need and how difficult that actually is. Being able to just provide that for them, so it's a worry that they might not have to face, is really cool for me.” Battles shared the same sentiment. click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy Backpacks at the second annual Youth Summer Jam click to enlarge PHOTO: \"VOEFlash” of The Urban Anatomy At the second annual Youth Summer Jam “We just want to do good,” Battles says. “We just want to help the community. We just want to help the people around us. These local businesses are the people around us. They're the ones who need help, just like us, so we like to shop local. We like to support local and just continue to network.

She was digging through my closet as part of a closet edit — a service offered by her personal styling service, Style for Good PGH, which is out to revolutionize how we think about fashion. The Pittsburgh-based company is dedicated to reducing fast fashion and promoting sustainable, ethical style that supports mental well-being. Founded in 2021 by Couch, lead stylist, and Sarah Daxton, who manages operations, Style for Good helps clients rethink their style habits through repurposing clothes or utilizing the abundant supply of pre-loved clothing in Pittsburgh. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Style for Good Taylor Couch (left) and Sarah Daxton (right) of Style for Good The organization’s inclusive services cater to Pittsburghers of all backgrounds, budgets, and gender identities, with an emphasis on helping people often excluded from mainstream fashion. Using a unique “pay what feels good” pricing model, clients pay any amount that aligns with their personal needs. Since its inception, Style for Good has served about 30 clients through style consultations, closet edits, thrift shopping trips, organizing, and “shop your closet” sessions to revamp existing wardrobes. They have supported hundreds more individuals through pop-up markets, secondhand swaps, speaking engagements, and workshops. “We mean [Style for Good] in every way you can think of,” Couch tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We want to be corrective in the world of style. So … style that is sustainable for our clients … how we can pick pieces that really work for you, forever, for good. And also, with that mental health side, it’s to make you feel better and make your life a little bit better.” The emphasis on mental health is personal for both Couch and Daxton. Couch grew up with the maxim, “If you feel bad, look good,” highlighting the power of dressing to uplift your mood. Similarly, Daxton, who deals with depression, says that even small, sustainable movements, like changing from one pair of sweatpants to another pair on a tough day, can significantly impact how we feel. “We don’t anticipate that the right sweater will cure your depression,” Couch says. “But we know that style is a tool in what should be a very diverse toolbox of support for whatever your needs are.” Recognizing that many people feel pressured to fit into clothes rather than find clothes that fit them, Couch and Daxton emphasize that fashion isn’t one size fits all; it can be a utility, an art, and a form of self-expression. By challenging the notion that fashion is a luxury, they believe more people can become empowered to find their unique styles. “Everyone should feel good in their body and what they choose to wear, and that’s really the driving component for us,” Daxton tells City Paper. Couch says that the pair takes particular pride in offering self- and gender-affirming styling services. “One of our first big affirming style clients was a mother seeking styling services for her daughter who was transitioning,” says Couch. “It’s so exciting to help someone build their first transition wardrobe — it’s one of the greatest honors.” Couch and Daxton first met in graduate school. As their instant friendship blossomed, the idea of starting a business together took root. “After the pandemic, we both needed to find new jobs and landed in fast fashion,” says Couch. “We were really seeing firsthand the struggles of both our customers and us as people working in it — seeing the impact environmentally so much more clearly by the sheer volume of clothes we were interacting with.” Their shared frustration prompted action. “It really kind of kicked us into high gear,” says Couch. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Style for Good Taylor Couch and a client take on a closet edit. For those hesitant to take the first step toward a more mindful approach to fashion, Daxton offers simple advice: “Think about how you want to feel. It’s not so much about the clothes, but it’s about the feeling in your body and your mind. What do you want to emit to the world, and to yourself?” The organization’s message resonated with me personally when I first met Couch and Daxton at a Prototype PGH “cozy clothing swap” event, where attendees traded unwanted garbs and accessories for new-to-them pieces. Having struggled to define my personal style for the better part of my 20s, I signed up for a free consultation with Couch. Our conversation delved deep: Couch asked questions like who I wanted to be when I put my clothes on, what a joyful wardrobe looks like, and how I wanted my clothing to make me feel. After purging my closet dozens of times on my own through the years only to feel overwhelmed and depleted, I took the next step and booked a closet edit — a signature Style for Good service where Couch revamped my closet with me. Piece by piece, Couch helped me think differently about the process of letting go. It wasn’t about achieving a perfectly coordinated closet, but about lifting the weight of excess to make space for what would empower me to be my most authentic and comfortable self. Working with Style for Good allowed me to reimagine my fashion identity and get closer to a pared-down wardrobe that fits just right.
