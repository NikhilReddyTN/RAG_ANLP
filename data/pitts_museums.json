It was followed by other philanthropic infant schools across Great Britain. Infant teaching came to include moral education, exercise, and an authoritative but friendly teacher. Infant schools increased the education that many children received before leaving school to work. State-funded schools in England and Wales were advised in 1840 to include infant departments. Infant education came under pressure to achieve quick academic progress, notably through rote learning. Beginning in 1905, infant lessons in England and Wales shifted towards more child-centred methods of teaching, where education was meant to reflect the preferences of children. The child-centred approach reached its peak following a report in 1967. In 1988, a more centralised curriculum was introduced. The term \"infant department\" was used widely in Scotland in the 1960s but is no longer much used there. (Full article...)

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology[edit] Main article: Name of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19] \"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20] From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22] History[edit] Main article: History of Pittsburgh For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh. Historical claims Kingdom of France 1690s–1763 Great Britain 1681–1781 United States 1776–present Native Americans[edit] The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]: 289 18th century[edit] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh. The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26] In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28] During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32] During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36] Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century[edit] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857 Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874) Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[37] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[38] The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39] The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century[edit] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[41] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[42] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936. The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45] During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[48] Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11] In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century[edit] During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49] In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50] Geography[edit] See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a] The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53] Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape[edit] Main articles: Downtown Pittsburgh, North Side (Pittsburgh), South Side (Pittsburgh), and West End (Pittsburgh) See also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods East Carson Street in the South Side Flats Shadyside neighborhood The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding it—Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55] Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown. The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58] The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development. The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[73] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74] Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The city ranked 26th for short-term particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for year-round particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84] Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86] As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87] Water quality[edit] Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95] The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104] Demographics[edit] This section needs to be updated.

Each dot is 25 people: ⬤ White ⬤ Black ⬤ Asian ⬤ Hispanic ⬤ Other At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010,[108] compared to 78.7% in 1970.[109] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[107] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,[115] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census.[116] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States.[117] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[118] In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males. The median income for a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.[119] Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year.[120][121] As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[122] Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China, India, Korea and Italy.[123] Demographic changes[edit] Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[13] This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[124] In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125] These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127] Religion[edit] Religion in Pittsburgh (2014)[128] Religion Percent Protestantism 42% Catholicism 32% Other Christian 3% No religion 18% Others 4% Don't know 1% According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.[128] According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.[118] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200.[129] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.[130][131] Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Pittsburgh See also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[132] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[133] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[134] or the American Dream.[135] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[136] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[137] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[138] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[139] The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees.

Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[191] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[192] Livability[edit] The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park Pittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy.

The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[224][225] Per 100,000 persons stats (2012): Murder Rape Robbery Assault Burglary Theft Motor vehicle Total violent Total property City 13.1 15.1 363.3 360.4 812.8 2,438.2 174.3 752.0 3,425.4 At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226] In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230] Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231] Education[edit] Colleges and universities[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh The main campus of Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University. Also in the city are Carlow University, Chatham University, Point Park University, the Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science. The campuses of Carlow, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Pittsburgh are near each other in the Oakland neighborhood that is the city's traditional cultural center. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private research university founded by Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon.[232] CMU contains the Mellon College of Science, School of Computer Science, College of Engineering, School of Business, Heinz College, College of Fine Arts, writing, Social and Decision Sciences, information systems, statistics, and psychology programs. The University of Pittsburgh, established in 1787 and popularly referred to as \"Pitt\", is a state-related school with one of the nation's largest research programs.[14] Pitt is known for the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh College of Business Administration, University of Pittsburgh School of Law, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work, and other biomedical and health-related sciences.[232][233][234][235][236] Carlow University is a small private Catholic university that while coeducational, has traditionally educated women. Chatham University, a liberal arts college that was founded as a woman's college but became fully coeducational in 2015,[237] is in the Shadyside neighborhood, but also maintains a 388-acre (157 ha) Eden Hall Farm campus in the North Hills. Duquesne University, a private Catholic university in the Bluff neighborhood and is noted for its song and dance troupe, the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, as well as programs in law, business, and pharmacy. Point Park University was founded in 1961 and is well known for its Conservatory of Performing Arts and its Pittsburgh Playhouse. Primary education[edit] Further information: Pittsburgh Public Schools Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh in November 2006 Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers are paid well relative to their peers, ranking 17th in 2000 among the 100 largest cities by population for the highest minimum salary. In 2018, the starting teacher salary offered to teachers with a BA was $46,920. The maximum annual salary for a teacher with a master's degree was $95,254.[238] Local public schools include many charter and magnet schools, including City Charter High School (computer and technology focused), Pittsburgh Montessori School (formerly Homewood Montessori), Pittsburgh Gifted Center, Barack Obama Academy of International Studies 6-12, Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts 6–12, Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, and the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.

Independent student-written university-based newspapers include The Pitt News of the University of Pittsburgh, The Tartan of Carnegie Mellon University, The Duquesne Duke of Duquesne University, and The Globe of Point Park University. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law is also home to JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service.[241] Television[edit] The Pittsburgh metro area is served by multiple local television and radio stations. The Pittsburgh designated market area (DMA) is the 22nd-largest in the U.S. with 1,163,150 homes (1.045% of the total U.S.).[242] The major network television stations include KDKA-TV 2 (CBS), WTAE 4 (ABC), WPXI 11 (NBC), WINP-TV 16 (Ion), WPKD-TV 19 (Independent), WPNT 22 (The CW/MyNetworkTV), WPCB 40 (Cornerstone), and WPGH-TV 53 (Fox). KDKA-TV, WINP-TV, and WPCB are owned-and-operated by their respective networks. WQED 13 is the local PBS member station in Pittsburgh. It was established on April 1, 1954, and was the first community-sponsored television station and the fifth public station in the United States. The station has produced much original content for PBS, including Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, several National Geographic specials, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?[243] Radio[edit] A wide variety of radio stations serve the Pittsburgh market. The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, which began airing on November 2, 1920.[244] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKA-FM 93.7 FM (sports), WKST-FM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMO-AM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock).

Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM). Film[edit] Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[245] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys,[246] Dogma,[246] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[246] Sudden Death, Flashdance,[246] Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[246] Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences.[246][247] Pittsburgh became \"Gotham City\" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises.[147] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.[248] From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy.[249][250] Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[251][252] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[253] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[252] Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[254][255] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[256][257] Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[258][259][260][261][262] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[263] Utilities[edit] Further information: Allegheny County Sanitary Authority The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[264] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[265] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[266] Health care[edit] See also: List of hospitals in Pittsburgh UPMC's flagship, UPMC Presbyterian Allegheny General Hospital, the flagship of the Allegheny Health Network The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among U.S. News & World Report's \"Honor Roll\" every year since 2000.[citation needed] The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[267] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".[268] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[26] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[269] In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[270] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[271] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273] The $80 million ($146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed] In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276] Health discoveries[edit] While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955. UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279] The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280] Transportation[edit] Main article: Transportation in Pittsburgh Aerial view of some of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges\".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283] Public transportation statistics[edit] Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[284] Expressways and highways[edit] Expressways Other Highways Parkway North US 19 PA 88 Parkway East & West TruckUS 19 PA 121 Crosstown PA 8 PA 130 Allegheny Valley Expressway PA 50 PA 380 Ohio River Boulevard PA 51 PA 837 PA 60 PA 885 I-279 Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh). Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit] Main articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City. Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285] Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station. Regional mass transit[edit] Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit Steel Plaza subway station Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook. Freight rail[edit] Union Station, built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Port[edit] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[289] Notable people[edit] Main article: List of people from Pittsburgh Sister cities[edit] Pittsburgh's sister cities are:[290] Bilbao, Spain Da Nang, Vietnam Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay Gaziantep, Turkey Glasgow, Scotland Karmiel, Israel Matanzas, Cuba Misgav, Israel Naucalpan, Mexico Ostrava, Czech Republic Prešov, Slovakia Saarbrücken, Germany Saitama, Japan San Isidro, Nicaragua Sheffield, England[g] Skopje, North Macedonia Sofia, Bulgaria Wuhan, China Zagreb, Croatia See also[edit] Pennsylvania portalCities portal Greater Pittsburgh Region List of fiction set in Pittsburgh List of municipalities in Pennsylvania List of people from Pittsburgh Explanatory notes[edit] ^ The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill. ^ The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

Many museums have exhibitions of these objects on public display, and some have private collections that are used by researchers and specialists. Museums host a much wider range of objects than a library, and they usually focus on a specific theme, such as the arts, science, natural history or local history. Public museums that host exhibitions and interactive demonstrations are often tourist attractions, and many draw large numbers of visitors from outside of their host country, with the most visited museums in the world attracting millions of visitors annually. Since the establishment of the earliest known museum in ancient times, museums have been associated with academia and the preservation of rare items. Museums originated as private collections of interesting items, and not until much later did the emphasis on educating the public take root. Etymology[edit] The English word museum comes from Latin, and is pluralized as museums (or rarely, musea). It is originally from the Ancient Greek Μουσεῖον (mouseion), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), and hence was a building set apart for study and the arts,[1] especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research at Alexandria, built under Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BC.[2] Purpose[edit] Visitors examining fossils displayed at the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, Iran The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display objects of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the study and education of the public. To city leaders, an active museum community can be seen as a gauge of the cultural or economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To museum professionals, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge.[citation needed] In 1829, James Smithson's bequest funding the Smithsonian Institution stated that he wanted to establish an institution \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge\".[3] In the late 19th century, museums of natural history exemplified the scientific drive for classifying life and interpreting the world. Their purpose was to gather examples from each field of knowledge for research and display. Concurrently, as American colleges expanded during the 19th century, they also developed their own natural history collections to support the education of their students. By the last quarter of the 19th century, scientific research in universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting-edge research moved from museums to university laboratories.[4] While many large museums, such as the Smithsonian Institution, are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve cultural artifacts for future generations. Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in ageing documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings. All museums display objects that are important to a culture. As historian Steven Conn writes, \"To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience, can be enchanting.\"[5] Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology Museum favored education over the preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historical printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.[6] Some museums seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while others have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display. Apart from questions of provenance and conservation, museums take into consideration the former use and status of an object. Religious or holy objects, for instance, are handled according to cultural rules. Jewish objects that contain the name of God may not be discarded, but need to be buried.[7] Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, Hampton Court Palace, a palace of Henry VIII, in England opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, however, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in an impression of what Tudor life may have been.[8] Definitions[edit] A guided tour group at the Soumaya Museum in Mexico City, MexicoMajor professional organizations from around the world offer some definitions as to what constitutes a museum, and their purpose. Common themes in all the definitions are public good and the care, preservation, and interpretation of collections. The International Council of Museums' current definition of a museum (adopted in 2022): \"A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.\"[9] The Canadian Museums Association's definition: \"A museum is a non-profit, permanent establishment, that does not exist primarily for the purpose of conducting temporary exhibitions and that is open to the public during regular hours and administered in the public interest for the purpose of conserving, preserving, studying, interpreting, assembling and exhibiting to the public for the instruction and enjoyment of the public, objects and specimens or educational and cultural value including artistic, scientific, historical and technological material.\"[10] The United Kingdom's Museums Association's definition: \"Museums enable people to explore collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment. They are institutions that collect, safeguard and make accessible artifacts and specimens, which they hold in trust for society.\" While the American Alliance of Museums does not have such a definition, their list of accreditation criteria to participate in their Accreditation Program states a museum must: \"Be a legally organized nonprofit institution or part of a nonprofit organization or government entity; Be essentially educational in nature; Have a formally stated and approved mission; Use and interpret objects or a site for the public presentation of regularly scheduled programs and exhibits; Have a formal and appropriate program of documentation, care, and use of collections or objects; Carry out the above functions primarily at a physical facility or site; Have been open to the public for at least two years; Be open to the public at least 1,000 hours a year; Have accessioned 80 percent of its permanent collection; Have at least one paid professional staff with museum knowledge and experience; Have a full-time director to whom authority is delegated for day-to-day operations; Have the financial resources sufficient to operate effectively; Demonstrate that it meets the Core Standards for Museums; Successfully complete the Core Documents Verification Program\".[11] Additionally, there is a legal definition of museum in United States legislation authorizing the establishment of the Institute of Museum and Library Services: \"Museum means a public, tribal, or private nonprofit institution which is organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational, cultural heritage, or aesthetic purposes and which, using a professional staff: Owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate; Cares for these objects; and Exhibits them to the general public on a regular basis\" (Museum Services Act 1976).[12] History[edit] Ancient[edit] One of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi in modern Iraq at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The site dates from c. 530 BC, and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.[13][14] Ancient Greeks and Romans collected and displayed art and objects but perceived museums differently from modern-day views. In the classical period, the museums were the temples and their precincts which housed collections of votive offerings. Paintings and sculptures were displayed in gardens, forums, theaters, and bathhouses.[15] In the ancient past there was little differentiation between libraries and museums with both occupying the building and were frequently connected to a temple or royal palace. The Museum of Alexandria, identical to the Library of Alexandria, was an inspiration during the early Renaissance period and thus originally libraries were called museums.[16] The royal palaces and temples, such as the Roman temple of Peace, also functioned as a kind of museum outfitted with art and objects from conquered territories and gifts from ambassadors from other kingdoms allowing the ruler to display the amassed collections to guests and to visiting dignitaries.[17] Also in Alexandria from the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 285–246 BCE), was the first zoological park. At first used by Philadelphus in an attempt to domesticate African elephants for use in war, the elephants were also used for show along with a menagerie of other animals specimens including hartebeests, ostriches, zebras, leopards, giraffes, rhinoceros, and pythons.[18][19] Early[edit] See also: List of museums from the 18th century The Dresden Electoral Stable (1588)[edit] The lavishly painted Dresden Renaissance Stable was as big as the nearby castle and opened in 1588 to visitors. It showed beside the Italian riding art horses carved figurines of horses and riders, paintings, some 50 sleds, armours etc. in a museum setting with guided tours. The first museum of the modern era was the Renaissance stable building known as the \"Electoral Stable and Stable Courtyard Dresden\" (later called the Johanneum) in Dresden, constructed between 1586 and 1588. In this building, the Saxon Elector Christian I displayed not only his 128 elite stallions but also over 50 carved figures of horses and their riders, sleds with carved and later stuffed horses, saddles, weapons, and historical armors. Guided tours were offered for anyone desiring to see it from the very beginning, and it was even described in the region’s first travel guide in 1632.[20] Numerous descriptions hence remain. To serve its purpose as an exhibition space, deliberately focused on the theme of expensive horses used in equestrian arts, the interior and exterior of the palace-like stable were elaborately painted. An automaton dispensed welcome drinks, and more than 35 rooms were decorated with equestrian accessories. This magnificent equestrian museum was partly motivated by the rejection of images following the Reformation. However, it was also accompanied by an ancestral gallery of the Wettin family, which was also open for viewing in the Long Corridor (Langer Gang) in Dresden starting in 1588, and a guidebook was created for it. The main focus, however, remained on the horses, while the treatise \"Reflections on How to Establish a Kunstkammer\" by Gabriel Kaltenmarckt was already made available to Christian I starting in 1587.[20]The old Ashmolean Museum building in Oxford, England Kunstkammer (Cabinet of Curiosities)[edit] Other early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and artifacts. These were often displayed in so-called \"wonder rooms\" or cabinets of curiosities. These collections first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.[21] Public access to these collections was often possible only at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but also used the museum as a way to sort and \"manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced\".[22] One of these naturalists and collectors was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was \"encyclopedic\" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist.[23] The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as \"the museums that contained this knowledge\". The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on \"organization and taxonomy\" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.[24] The first museums in the form of cabinets of curiosities were, contrary to the above mentioned Dresden stable building, often accessible only for the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. In the Vienna Hofburg, the Dresden Residenzschloss as well as the Castle of Ambras such collections were housed since ca. 1560, but only for private eyes. An especially ancient collection is also the Capitolinian collection, dating from 1471, which was however only opened to the public in 1734.[1] When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day.[25] The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.[26] The Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum.[27] The collection included that of Elias Ashmole which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood.[28] The Louvre in 1853 In France, the first public museum was the Louvre in Paris,[29] opened in 1793 during the French Revolution, which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each \"décade\" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the French Republican Calendar). The Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As Napoléon I conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually returned to their owners (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe. The Nantong Museum, the first Chinese-sponsored museum Chinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as \"bone amassing buildings\" or \"courtyards of treasures\" or \"painting pavilions\" or \"curio stores\" or \"halls of military feats\" or \"gardens of everything\". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe's World's Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' – this would eventually become accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.[30] Modern[edit] American museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called \"The Museum Period\" or \"The Museum Age\"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Drawing on Michel Foucault's concept of liberal government, Tony Bennett has suggested the development of more modern 19th-century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public. As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these \"new tasks of social management\".[31] Universities became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of World War II. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.[32] An exhibition of the remains of Native Americans at the Royal Ontario Museum in 1908The late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains.[33] In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American \"cultural items\" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups.[34] Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.[35] Management[edit] An Honour (Honors) board listing the directors of a museum in Auckland, New Zealand The roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution.[36] Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums. Board of Trustees or Board of directors – The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution.[37] Some museums use the terms \"directors\" and \"trustees\" interchangeably but both are different legal instruments. A board of directors governs a nonprofit corporation, a board of trustees is responsible for governing a charitable trust, foundation, or endowment.[38] In the case of small museums and all volunteer museums, a board may be more hands-on in the day-to-day operations of the museum.[39] Director – The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly. According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, \"Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession.\"[37] A curator and exhibit designer dressing a mannequin for an exhibit Restoration of a gilded mirror by a conservator Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums: Curator – Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum's collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, The Henry Ford has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc. Many art museums have curators dedicated to specific historical periods and geographic regions, such as American art and modern or contemporary art.[citation needed] Collections Management – Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy. Registrar – Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They ensure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum's collections policy.[citation needed] Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management.[40] Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly. Exhibit Designer – Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.[citation needed] Conservator – Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.[41] Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer. At smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary. Protection[edit] The cultural property stored in museums is threatened in many countries by natural disaster, war, terrorist attacks or other emergencies. To this end, an internationally important aspect is a strong bundling of existing resources and the networking of existing specialist competencies in order to prevent any loss or damage to cultural property or to keep damage as low as possible. International partner for museums is UNESCO and Blue Shield International in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999. For legal reasons, there are many international collaborations between museums, and the local Blue Shield organizations.[42][43] Blue Shield has conducted extensive missions to protect museums and cultural assets in armed conflict, such as 2011 in Egypt and Libya, 2013 in Syria and 2014 in Mali and Iraq. During these operations, the looting of the collection is to be prevented in particular.[44] Gallery – Museum storage[edit] Archive Processing rooms provide a space for archivists to arrange and describe archival materials to make them accessible to researchers. Museum textile storage includes rolled storage racks, hanging wardrobe and garments shelving, and cabinets. Collections storage for three-dimensional historic artifacts. In museums, paintings, framed and unframed, are normally hung on sliding or fixed racking. Planning[edit] Exhibit planning See also: Museum planning and Interpretive planning The design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community.[45] According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs: \"The new museum ... does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use.\"[46] The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.[47] Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.[48] In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an interpretive plan are all developed as part of the museum planning process. Some museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions. Museums are laid out in a specific way for a specific reason and each person who enters the doors of a museum will see its collection completely differently to the person behind them- this is what makes museums fascinating because they are represented differently to each individual.[49]: 9–10 Financial uses[edit] See also: Economic theory of museums Construction of Titanic Belfast in 2010In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities.[50] Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao was built in Bilbao, Spain, in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project.[51] Nonetheless, over 1.1 million people visited the museum in 2015, indicating it appeared to have paid off for the local government despite local backlash; key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao.[52] A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was the Titanic Belfast, built on disused shipyards in Belfast, Northern Ireland, incidentally for the same price as the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and by the same architect, Frank Gehry, in time for the 100th anniversary of Titanic's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland.[53] In the United States, similar projects include the 81,000 square foot Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia and The Broad in Los Angeles. Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The Taubman Museum of Art is an example of an expensive museum (eventually $66 million) that attained little success and continues to have a low endowment for its size.[54] Some museum activists see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that \"to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment.\"[50] Funding[edit] Officials blamed a lack of funding for a 2018 fire at the National Museum of Brazil that destroyed over 90% of its contents [55] Museums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%.[56] Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation.[57][58] The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55.[59] Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding.[60] Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.[61] Exhibition design[edit] Main article: Exhibit design Paintings arranged in groupings in the \"salon style\" Most mid-size and large museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers[62] and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research, evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.[63] Left: \"Cabinet of curiosities\" style of exhibit, c. 1890. Right: Contemporary history exhibit, 2016. Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in all museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology.[64] As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development; Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead \"thinning out\" the objects presented \"for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them\".[65] This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.[66] Types[edit] Classic cars displayed at an automotive museum, which could be considered both a history and technology museum Background There is no definitive standard as to the set types of museums. Additionally, the museum landscape has become so varied, that it may not be sufficient to use traditional categories to comprehend fully the vast variety existing throughout the world. However, it may be useful to categorize museums in different ways under multiple perspectives. Museums can vary based on size, from large institutions, to very small institutions focusing on specific subjects, such as a specific location, a notable person, or a given period of time. Museums also can be based on the main source of funding: central or federal government, provinces, regions, universities; towns and communities; other subsidised; nonsubsidised and private.[67] It may sometimes be useful to distinguish between diachronic museums which interpret the way its subject matter has developed and evolved through time (e.g., Lower East Side Tenement Museum and Diachronic Museum of Larissa), and synchronic museums which interpret the way its subject matter existed at a certain point in time (e.g., the Anne Frank House and Colonial Williamsburg). According to University of Florida Professor Eric Kilgerman, \"While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic.\"[68] In her book Civilizing the Museum, author Elaine Heumann Gurian proposes that there are five categories of museums based on intention and not content: object centered, narrative, client centered, community centered, and national.[69] Museums can also be categorized into major groups by the type of collections they display, to include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children's museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g., museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. The size of a museum's collection typically determines the museum's size, whereas its collection reflects the type of museum it is. Many museums normally display a \"permanent collection\" of important selected objects in its area of specialization, and may periodically display \"special collections\" on a temporary basis.[citation needed] Major types[edit] The following is a list to give an idea of the major museum types. While comprehensive, it is not a definitive list. Agricultural Architecture Archaeological Art Automotive Design Biographical Children's Community Encyclopedic Folk Historic house Historic site Living history Local Maritime Medical Memorial Military Natural history Open-air Science Virtual Legal framework[edit] Public vs. private[edit] Private museums are organized by individuals and managed by a board and museum officers, but public museums are created and managed by federal, state, or local governments. A government can charter a museum through legislative action but the museum can still be private as it is not part of the government. The distinction regulates the ownership and legal accountability for the care of the collections.[38][70] Non-profit vs. for-profit[edit] Nonprofit means that an organization is classified as a charitable corporation and is exempt from paying most taxes and the money the organization earns is invested in the organization itself. Money made by a private, for-profit museum is paid to the museum's owners or shareholders. The nonprofit museum has a fiduciary responsibility in regards to the public, in essence the museum holds its collections and administers it for the benefit of the public. Collections of for-profit museums are legally corporate assets the museum administers for the benefit of the owners or shareholders.[38][70] Run by trusts vs. corporations[edit] A trust is a legal instrument where trustees manage the trust's assets for the benefit of the museum following the specific wishes of the donor. This provides tax benefits for the donor, and also allows the donor to have control over how assets are distributed. Corporations are legal entities and may acquire property in a way similar to how an individual can own property. Museums under incorporation are usually organized by a community or group of individuals. While a board of director's loyalty is to the corporation, a board of trustee's loyalty has to be loyal to the intention of the trust. The ramification is that a trust is far less flexible than a corporation.[71][72] Current challenges[edit] Decolonization[edit] See also: Decolonisation of knowledge Moai figure at the British Museum A global movement for the decolonization of museums has been gaining momentum since the late 20th century.[73] Proponents of this movement argue that \"museums are a box of things\" and do not represent complete stories; instead they show biased narratives based on ideologies, in which certain stories are intentionally disregarded.[49]: 9–18 Through this, people are encouraging others to consider this missing perspective, when looking at museum collections, as every object viewed in such environments was placed by an individual to represent a certain viewpoint, be it historical or cultural.[49]: 9–18 The 2018 report on the restitution of African cultural heritage[74] is a prominent example regarding the decolonization of museums and other collections in France and the claims of African countries to regain artifacts illegally taken from their original cultural settings. Since 1868, several monolithic human figures known as Moai have been removed from Easter Island and put in display in major Western museums such as the National Museum of Natural History, the British Museum, the Louvre and the Royal Museums of Art and History. Several demands have been made by Easter Island residents for the return of the Moai.[75] The figures are seen as ancestors and family or the soul by the Rapa Nui and hold deep cultural value to their people.[75] Other examples include the Gweagal Shield, thought to be a very significant shield taken from Botany Bay in April 1770[76] or the Parthenon marble sculptures, which were taken from Greece by Lord Elgin in 1805.[77] Successive Greek governments have unsuccessfully petitioned for the return of the Parthenon marbles.[77] Another example among many others is the so-called Montezuma's headdress in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, which is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico.[78] As well as an argument for the decolonization of museums, there is also the push by some to represent, in both exhibitions and new museums, the marginalized communities within a culture or society. One example of this is the Black Miner's Museum in Nottingham, England.[79][80] Labor issues and unionization[edit] Workers rallying at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Background The past few years has seen a unionizing movement. US museums workers have initiated dialogs about labor and collective organizing in the cultural sector. In 2019 the workers in multiple museums voted to form unions with more protesting to press for a fair contract and against unfair labor practices.[81] During that year over 3,000 cultural workers anonymously started to share their salaries online through a pay transparency spreadsheet.[82] The Marciano Art Foundation, a museum established by co-founders of Guess clothing, Maurice Marciano and Paul Marciano closed indefinitely in November 2019 after workers attempted to unionize.[83][84] The Marciano Foundation released a statement a month later that the closure was permanent.[85] In the country of Georgia 40 employees were fired May 2022 as part of a restructuring. The newly formed union, the Georgian Trade Union of Science, Education, and Culture Workers said in a statement they said the employees were fired illegally and the reorganization was \"carried out by the employer in an untransparent and maladministered manner\" and that the organization will \"definitely fight to the end to protect the rights of employees.\" Fired senior curator Maia Pataridze said the new management mentioned her social media posts criticizing the government.[86][87] Among those fired was union chair, Nikoloz Tsikaridze, a senior researcher and archaeologist who associated the discharging of himself and other museum staff was for forming a union, and said that Thea Tsulukiani, the Georgia Minister of Culture had \"punished\" them.[88][89] History In the United States, labor unrest within the arts and cultural sector go back at least nearly a century to 1933 when a New York-based collective of artists eventually known as the Artist's Union used collective bargaining for state relief for unemployed artists.[90] In 1971 administrative staff at New York's Museum of Modern Art formed the organization \"Professional and Staff Association of the Museum of Modern Art\" (PASTA), the first union of professional employees, as opposed to maintenance and service people, at a privately‐financed museum. The contract negotiated would provide a wage increase, protection against termination without cause, and direct access to trustees and policy-making processes at the museum. While there was some interest from workers at other museums at the time, for the next fifty years there was little change in museums adding union representation of their professional employees.[82][91] Sustainability and climate change[edit] See also: Green museum Increasingly museums have responded to the ongoing climate crisis through enacting sustainable museum practices, and exhibitions highlighting the issues surrounding climate change and the Anthropocene. Digital culture[edit] As digital culture has increased in society, museums have needed to respond to these changes in the facilities that they offer online.[92] See also[edit] Museums portal Audio tour Category:Types of museums Cell phone tour Collective memory Computer Interchange of Museum Information International Museum Day (18 May) List of largest art museums List of most visited art museums List of most-visited museums by region Lists of museums .museum Museum education Museum fatigue Museum label Museum shop Science tourism Virtual Library museums pages References[edit] ^ Findlen, Paula (1989). \"The Museum: its classical etymology and renaissance genealogy\".

For the legal status in Finland and Germany, see Registered association (Finland) and Registered association (Germany). Logo of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organization of the United Nations A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a nonbusiness entity,[1] nonprofit institution,[2] not-for-profit organisation,[3] or simply a nonprofit,[a] is a non-governmental (private) legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public or social benefit, as opposed to an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a profit for its owners. A nonprofit organization is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties. Depending on the local laws, charities are regularly organized as non-profits. A host of organizations may be nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, hospitals, business associations, churches, foundations, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. Nonprofit entities may seek approval from governments to be tax-exempt, and some may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions, but an entity may incorporate as a nonprofit entity without having tax-exempt status. Key aspects of nonprofits are their ability to fulfill their mission with respect to accountability, integrity, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. Theoretically, for a nonprofit that seeks to finance its operations through donations, public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. Presumably, the more a nonprofit focuses on their mission, the more public confidence they will gain. This will result in more money for the organization.[1] The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public's confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are. There is an important distinction in the US between non-profit and not-for-profit organizations (NFPOs); while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a sports club, whose purpose is its members' enjoyment.[4] The names used and precise regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another. Fundraising[edit] Nonprofit organizations are not driven by generating profit, but they must bring in enough income to pursue their social goals. Nonprofits are able to raise money in different ways. This includes income from donations from individual donors or foundations; sponsorship from corporations; government funding; programs, services or merchandise sales, and investments.[5] Each NPO is unique in which source of income works best for them. With an increase in NPOs since 2010, organizations have adopted competitive advantages to create revenue for themselves to remain financially stable. Donations from private individuals or organizations can change each year and government grants have diminished. With changes in funding from year to year, many nonprofit organizations have been moving toward increasing the diversity of their funding sources. For example, many nonprofits that have relied on government grants have started fundraising efforts to appeal to individual donors.[6] Management[edit] Most nonprofits have staff that work for the company, possibly using volunteers to perform the nonprofit's services under the direction of the paid staff. Nonprofits must be careful to balance the salaries paid to staff against the money paid to provide services to the nonprofit's beneficiaries. Organizations whose salary expenses are too high relative to their program expenses may face regulatory scrutiny.[7] A second misconception is that nonprofit organizations may not make a profit. Although the goal of nonprofits is not specifically to maximize profits, they still have to operate as a fiscally responsible business. They must manage their income (both grants and donations, and income from services) and expenses so as to remain a fiscally viable entity. Nonprofits have the responsibility of focusing on being professional and financially responsible, replacing self-interest and profit motive with mission motive.[8] Though nonprofits are managed differently from for-profit businesses, they have felt pressure to be more businesslike. To combat private and public business growth in the public service industry, nonprofits have modeled their business management and mission, shifting their reason of existing to establish sustainability and growth.[9] Setting effective missions is a key for the successful management of nonprofit organizations.[10] There are three important conditions for effective mission: opportunity, competence, and commitment.[10] One way of managing the sustainability of nonprofit organizations is to establish strong relations with donor groups.[10] This requires a donor marketing strategy, something many nonprofits lack.[10] Nonprofit organizations need to motivate staff, maintain and communicate a vision and set a strategic direction, manage change effectively, and provide a safe working environment for employees, volunteers and visitors. These issues are comparable to those affecting a commercial business but factors which place a nonprofit organization at risk have been identified such as lack of direction or clear purpose, over-centralized management and decision-making, and lack of engagement with staff.[11] Functions[edit] Nonprofit organizations provide public goods that are undersupplied by government.[12] NPOs have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. For legal classification, there are, nevertheless, some elements of importance: Management provisions Accountability and auditing provisions Provisory for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation Provisions for the dissolution of the entity Tax statuses of corporate and private donors Tax status of the founders Some of the above must be (in most jurisdictions in the US at least) expressed in the organization's charter of establishment or constitution. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction. While affiliations will not affect a legal status, they may be taken into consideration by legal proceedings as an indication of purpose. Most countries have laws that regulate the establishment and management of NPOs and that require compliance with corporate governance regimes. Most larger organizations are required to publish their financial reports detailing their income and expenditure publicly. In many aspects, they are similar to corporate business entities though there are often significant differences. Both not-for-profit[clarification needed] and for-profit corporate entities must have board members, steering-committee members, or trustees who owe the organization a fiduciary duty of loyalty and trust. A notable exception to this involves churches, which are often not required to disclose finances to anyone, including church members.[13] Formation and structure[edit] In the United States, nonprofit organizations are formed by filing bylaws, articles of incorporation, or both in the state in which they expect to operate. The act of incorporation creates a legal entity enabling the organization to be treated as a distinct body (corporation) by law and to enter into business dealings, form contracts, and own property as individuals or for-profit corporations can. Nonprofits can have members, but many do not. The nonprofit may also be a trust or association of members. The organization may be controlled by its members who elect the board of directors, board of governors or board of trustees. A nonprofit may have a delegate structure to allow for the representation of groups or corporations as members. Alternatively, it may be a non-membership organization and the board of directors may elect its own successors. The two major types of nonprofit organizations are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as 'members'; examples of such organizations are FairVote[14][15] and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.[16] The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making.[17] Accordingly, many organizations, such as the Wikimedia Foundation,[18] have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as the election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse.[19][20] A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements.[21] A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to members and directors is concerned. Tax exemption[edit] In many countries, nonprofits may apply for tax-exempt status, so that the organization itself may be exempt from income tax and other taxes. In the United States, to be exempt from federal income taxes, the organization must meet the requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while granting tax-exempt designation (such as IRC 501(c)) is granted by the federal government via the IRS. This means that not all nonprofits are eligible to be tax-exempt.[22] For example, employees of non-profit organizations pay taxes from their salaries, which they receive according to the laws of the country. NPOs use the model of a double bottom line in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization's sustainability.[23][24] An advantage of nonprofits registered in the UK is that they benefit from some reliefs and exemptions. Charities and nonprofits are exempt from Corporation Tax as well as the trustees being exempt from Income Tax.[25] There may also be tax relief available for charitable giving, via Gift Aid, monetary donations, and legacies.[26] In United States[edit] According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), there are more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered in the United States, including public charities, private foundations, and other nonprofit organizations. Private charitable contributions increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2017 (since 2014), at an estimated $410.02 billion. Out of these contributions, religious organizations received 30.9%, education organizations received 14.3%, and human services organizations received 12.1%.[27] Between September 2010 and September 2014, approximately 25.3% of Americans over the age of 16 volunteered for a nonprofit.[28] In the United States, both nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations are tax-exempt. There are various types of nonprofit exemptions, such as 501(c)(3) organizations that are a religious, charitable, or educational-based organization that does not influence state and federal legislation, and 501(c)(7) organizations that are for pleasure, recreation, or another nonprofit purpose.[29] There is an important distinction in the US between non-profit and not-for-profit organizations (NFPOs); while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a club, whose purpose is its members' enjoyment.[4] Other examples of NFPOs include: credit unions, sports clubs, and advocacy groups. Nonprofit organizations provide services to the community; for example aid and development programs, medical research, education, and health services. It is possible for a nonprofit to be both member-serving and community-serving.[citation needed] Online presence[edit] When selecting a domain name, NPOs often use one of the following: .org, the country code top-level domain of their respective country, or the .edu top-level domain (TLD), to differentiate themselves from more commercial entities, which typically use .com. In the traditional domain noted in RFC 1591, .org is for \"organizations that didn't fit anywhere else\" in the naming system, which implies that it is the proper category for non-commercial organizations if they are not governmental, educational, or one of the other types with a specific TLD. It is not designated specifically for charitable organizations or any specific organizational or tax-law status, but encompasses anything that is not classifiable as another category. Currently, no restrictions are enforced on registration of .com or .org, so one can find organizations of all sorts in either of those domains, as well as other top-level domains including newer, more specific ones which may apply to particular sorts of organization including .museum for museums and .coop for cooperatives. Organizations might also register by the appropriate country code top-level domain for their country. In 2020, nonprofit organizations began using microvlogging (brief videos with short text formats) on TikTok to reach Gen Z, engage with community stakeholders, and overall build community.[30] TikTok allowed for innovative engagement between nonprofit organizations and younger generations.[31] During COVID-19, TikTok was specifically used to connect rather than inform or fundraise, as its fast-paced, tailored For You Page separates itself from other social media apps such as Facebook and Twitter. Alternative names[edit] Some organizations offer new, positive-sounding alternative terminology to describe the sector. The term civil society organization (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, including the Center for the Study of Global Governance.[32] The term citizen sector organization (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector – as one of citizens, for citizens – by organizations including Ashoka: Innovators for the Public.[33] Advocates argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities, and limitations.[34] Criticism[edit] Founder's syndrome[edit] Main article: Founder's syndrome Founder's syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.[35] Financial mismanagement[edit] Financial mismanagement is a particular problem with NPOs because the employees are not accountable to anyone who has a direct stake in the organization. For example, an employee may start a new program without disclosing its complete liabilities. The employee may be rewarded for improving the NPO's reputation, making other employees happy, and attracting new donors. Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute accounting fraud. But even indirect liabilities negatively affect the financial sustainability of the NPO, and the NPO will have financial problems unless strict controls are instated.[36] Some commenters have argued that the receipt of significant funding from large for-profit corporations can ultimately alter the NPO's functions.[37] A frequent measure of an NPO's efficiency is its expense ratio (i.e. expenditures on things other than its programs, divided by its total expenditures). Tax exempt status of NPOs can result in some cases, such as mismanagement, in negative value for society.[38] Lower wages[edit] There are reports of major labor shortages in the nonprofit sector today, particularly for management positions.[39][40] While many established NPOs are well-funded and comparative to their public sector competitors, many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain people. The initial interest for many is the remuneration package, though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and the workload.[41] Public- and private-sector employment have, for the most part, been able to offer more to their employees than most nonprofit agencies throughout history. Either in the form of higher wages, more comprehensive benefit packages, or less tedious work, the public and private sectors have enjoyed an advantage over NPOs in attracting employees. Traditionally, the NPO has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause. Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally. This leads many young and driven employees to forego NPOs in favor of more stable employment. Today, however, nonprofit organizations are adopting methods used by their competitors and finding new means to retain their employees and attract the best of the newly minted workforce.[42] One article states that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector[43] and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. A good environment is ranked higher than salary and pressure of work.[40] NPOs are encouraged to pay as much as they are able and offer a low-stress work environment that the employee can associate him or herself positively with. Other incentives that should be implemented are generous vacation allowances or flexible work hours.[44] See also[edit] 501(c) organization Community organization Fundraising Master of Nonprofit Organizations Mutual organization Non-commercial activity Non-governmental organization Nonprofit organization laws by jurisdiction Non-profit organizations and access to public information Non-profit technology Public-benefit nonprofit corporation Supporting organization (charity) United States non-profit laws Voluntary sector Notes[edit] ^ As a nominalized adjective References[edit] ^ a b Ciconte, Barbara L.; Jacob, Jeanne (2009).

A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business. A distinction is made in law and public offices between the term business and a company such as a corporation or cooperative. Colloquially, the terms are used interchangeably. Corporations are distinct from with sole proprietors and partnerships. They are separate legal entities and provide limited liability for their owners and members. They are subject to corporate tax rates. They are also more complicated and expensive to set up, but offer more protection and benefits for the owners and members.[6] Forms Main article: List of business entitiesThis article is part of a series onCorporate law By jurisdiction Anguilla Australia BVI Canada Cayman Islands India South Africa UK United States Vietnam European Union France Germany General corporate forms Company Conglomerate Cooperative Corporation Holding company Joint-stock Partnership General Limited Limited liability Private limited Shell corporation Shelf corporation Sole proprietorship Corporate formsby jurisdiction European Union Societas (SE) Societas cooperativa (SCE) Societas privata (SPE) Societas unius personae (SUP) Economic interest grouping (EEIG) UK / Ireland / Commonwealth Charitable incorporated organisation (England and Wales) (CIO) Scottish charitable incorporated organisation (SCIO) Community interest company (CIC) Industrial and provident society (IPS) Limited company (Ltd.) by guarantee by shares proprietary public Unlimited company United States Benefit corporation C corporation Limited liability company (LLC) Low-profit LLC Series LLC Limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) S corporation Delaware corporation / statutory trust Massachusetts business trust Nevada corporation Others Aktiebolag (AB) Aktiengesellschaft (AG) Ansvarlig selskap (ANS) Aktieselskab (A/S) Aksjeselskap (AS) Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) Kabushiki gaisha (K.K.)

Doctrines Business judgment rule Corporate governance De facto and estoppel corporations Internal affairs doctrine Limited liability Tag-along right Drag-along right Piercing the corporate veil Rochdale Principles Ultra vires Related areas Beneficial ownership Civil procedure Contract Corporate registers Registered agent Company portal Law portalvte Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, a computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.[7] A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[8] Corporations' owners have limited liability, and the business has a legal personality separate from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.[9] A cooperative or co-op is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy. Limited liability companies (LLC) and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, a general partnership or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[10] A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[11] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[12] Company limited by guarantee is commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital. A company limited by shares is the most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\" with corporations being \"the most common example of a limited company.\"[13] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a publicly traded company or a privately held company. A company limited by guarantee with a share capital is a hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[14] An unlimited company with or without a share capital is a hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case, the doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply. Less common types of companies are: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today. Charter corporations were the only types of companies before the passing of modern companies legislation. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter). Statutory companies are certain companies that have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction, and are relatively rare today. \"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\"[15] In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \"members\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \"segregated portfolio companies\" and restricted purpose companies. There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world. Companies are also sometimes distinguished into public companies and private companies for legal and regulatory purposes. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and a future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders. A parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The subsidiary company can be allowed to maintain its own board of directors.[16] The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.[16] Classifications Main article: Industry classification Agriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals, and livestock, as well as lumber, oil, vegetables, fruits, etc. Mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, metals or minerals. Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hair stylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses. Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private-equity firms, private-equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital. Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, and shipping companies deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee. Utilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government. Entertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses. Sports organizations are involved in producing, facilitating, promoting, or organizing any activity, experience, or business enterprise focused on sports. They make their profits by selling goods and services that are sports related. Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft. Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings. Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers. Activities Accounting Main article: Accounting Accounting is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial information about economic entities[17][18] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[19] Accounting, which has been called the \"language of business\",[20] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[21] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \"accounting\" and \"financial reporting\" are often used as synonyms. Commerce Main article: Commerce Commerce is the process of exchanging goods and services.[22] It is not just a single activity, but a set of activities that includes trade (buying and selling goods and services) and auxiliary services or aids to trade,[23] that includes communication and marketing, logistics, finance, banking, insurance, and legal services related to trade. Business is also defined as engaging in commerce, as these are done in all businesses.[24] Finance Further information: Financial management and Managerial finance See also: Corporate finance and Strategic financial management Finance is a field that deals with the study of money and investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk.[25] In the context of business and management, finance deals with the problems of ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives; i.e. that it: (1) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and (2) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments. Finance also deals with the long term objective of maximizing the value of the business, while also balancing risk and profitability; this includes the interrelated questions of (1) capital investment, which businesses and projects to invest in; (2) capital structure, deciding on the mix of funding to be used; and (3) dividend policy, what to do with \"excess\" capital. Human resources Main article: Human resources Human resources can be defined as division of business that involves finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants.[26] Human resources, or HR, is crucial for all businesses to succeed as it helps companies adjust to a fast-moving business environment and the increasing demand for jobs.[26] The term \"Human Resource\" was first coined by John R. Commons in his novel 'The Distribution of Wealth'. HR departments are relatively new as they began developing in the late 20th century. HR departments main goal is to maximize employee productivity and protecting the company from any issues that may arise in the future. Some of the most common activities conducted by those working in HR include increasing innovation and creativity within a company, applying new approaches to work projects, and efficient training and communication with employees. Two of the most popular subdivisions of HR are Human Resource Management,[27] HRM, and Human Resource Information Systems,[28] or HRIS. The HRM route is for those who prefer an administrative role as it involves oversight of the entirety of the company. HRIS involves the storage and organization of employee data including full names, addresses, means of contact, and anything else required by that certain company. Some careers of those involved in the Human Resource field include enrollment specialists, HR analyst, recruiter, employment relations manager, etc. Information technology Many businesses have an Information technology (IT) department, which supports the use of information technology and computer systems in support of enterprise goals. The role of a chief information officer is to lead this department. For example, Ford Motor Company in the United States employs \"more than 3,000 team members with advanced computing, analytical and technical skills\".[29] Manufacturing Main article: Manufacturing Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Marketing Main article: Marketing Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\"[30] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing. With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies. Research and development Main article: Research and development Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation.[31] Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product.[32] Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[32] Safety Main article: Safety This safety plan of a small Italian business provides information regarding emergency instructions (earthquake and fire), emergency telephone numbers, escape routes and locations of first aid box and fire exstinguishers. Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[33] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduce incidents, insurance costs, and workers' compensation claims.[34] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[35] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \"canary in the coal mine\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees. Sales Main article: Sales Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[36] Management Main article: Management For a topical guide, see Outline of business management. The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[37] Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business's value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed] Restructuring state enterprises In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[38] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets. Business process management Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a \"process optimization process\". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?] Organization and regulation See also: Theory of the firm and Industry self-regulation Time required to start a business in 2017[39] Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law applicable to business. The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually: The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so. The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways. Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason. Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations. Control and coordination requirements. In function of the risk and complexity of the tasks to organize, a business is organized through a set of formal and informal mechanisms.[40][41] In particular, contractual and relational governance can help mitigate opportunism as well as support communication and information sharing.[41] Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \"person\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed. Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable. General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like \"real\" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed. In most countries, there are laws that treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment. \"Going public\" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the US, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot \"go public\". Commercial law Main article: Commercial law Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[42] The word \"corporation\" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[43] In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source.[according to whom?] Laws can govern the treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave. Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business. Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex[according to whom?] and can affect many businesses. Capital Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.[44] Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange,[45] or in multiple other ways.[44] Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the US), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one. Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing. Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures. Intellectual property Main article: Intellectual property Businesses often have important \"intellectual property\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets.[46] Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors. Trade unions Main article: Trade union A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions.[47] The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers.[47] The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\".[48] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

Virtual museums can perform as the digital footprint of a physical museum, or can act independently, while maintaining the authoritative status as bestowed by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in its definition of a museum. In tandem with the ICOM mission of a physical museum, the virtual museum is also committed to public access; to both the knowledge systems embedded in the collections and the systematic, and coherent organization of their display, as well as to their long-term preservation. As with a traditional museum, a virtual museum can be designed around specific objects (such as an art museum or a natural history museum), or can consist of online exhibitions created from primary or secondary resources (as, for example in a science museum). Moreover, a virtual museum can refer to the mobile or World Wide Web offerings of traditional museums (e.g., displaying digital representations of its collections or exhibits); or can be born digital content such as, 3D environments, net art, virtual reality and digital art. Often, discussed in conjunction with other cultural institutions, a museum by definition, is essentially separate from its sister institutions such as a library or an archive. Virtual museums are usually, but not exclusively delivered electronically when they are denoted as online museums, hypermuseum, digital museum, cybermuseums or web museums. Off-line pioneers (CD-ROM and digital media before 2000)[edit] The following museums were created with digital technology before the web gained any form of popularity or mass usability. CD-ROM and postal mail distribution made these museums available world-wide, before web browsers, fast connections and ubiquitous web usage. The Canadian new media artist collective named .(La société de conservation du présent), created the world's first Virtual museum accessible from 1989 to 1993 by modem via Bell Canada's Alex (videotex service) system. Critical of rising neo-liberalism and the standardization of museum and art practices \"the Musée Standard proposes to consider the circulation of information, the inscription of the archive in public space and its energization through a process of anarchy as an activity intimately linked to the movements of life and art.\"[2][3] The Australian new media artist Jeffrey Shaw created a Virtual Museum [4][5] in 1991. As presented in 1992 at Ars Electronica, it also incorporated pioneering AR features. The Virtual Museum, Apple Computer. Released as a CD-ROM in 1992, and distributed free worldwide to 1000 schools, universities and museums, The Virtual Museum was an interactive, electronic museum where users moved from room to room, and selected any exhibit in a room for more detailed examination. The exhibits in the museum were educational, encompassing topics such as medicine, plant growth, the environment, and space. To facilitate interaction with the museum, a new method for navigating through a prerendered 3D space, and interacting with objects in that space had been developed, called 'virtual navigation'. Virtual navigation employed real-time video decompression for the display of, and interaction with, high-quality computer animation. In addition, a representation for 3D objects in animated sequences was used which permitted pixel-accurate, frame-accurate object picking, so that a viewer was able to select any 3D object to trigger movement within the 3D space, to examine an exhibit in animated form, or to play a digital movie or soundtrack. The use of precomputed video permitted 3D navigation in a realistic-looking space, without requiring special-purpose graphics hardware. This was designed as a project to showcase new techniques in computer graphics at the time, particularly to push the envelope of what QuickTime was capable of, as it was still in beta. This project was the grandfather of QuickTime VR, which made sense given Eric Chen's role in the project. The Virtual Museum was a product of Apple Computer, Inc.'s 3D graphics group and was created by Gavin Miller, Eric Hoffert, Shenchang Eric Chen, Elizabeth Patterson, Dean Blackketter, Steve Rubin, Sally Applin, Derrick Yim and Jim Hanan under the leadership of Frank Crow.[6][7][8] Guggenheim Virtual Museum. In 1999, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation released an experimental interactive virtual museum, conceived by the American design office Asymptote Architecture and based on VRML technology, to provide a virtual hub for the various venues of the foundation around the world, as well as to host exhibitions of cyberart.[9] Online pioneers (web-based sites established before 2000)[edit] The following online museums were pioneers. In the period, web pages were simpler, bandwidth was slower, the concepts of the online museum were still developing, and there were limited multimedia technologies available within web browsers. Some online museums began in non-website electronic forms and not all were established by existing physical museums. Many online museums have become significant sources of scholarly information, including extensive citations within Wikipedia. ibiblio – founded 1992. An online exhibition with the backing of the Library of Congress, ibiblio hosted EXPO Ticket Office[10] with exhibits including a Vatican Exhibit[11] and even a virtual \"restaurant\"[12] and \"post office\".[13] This looks very simplistic now, but was novel in 1991. Museum of Computer Art (MOCA) – Founded 1993. Directed by Don Archer, a non-profit corporation under charter from the Department of Education of New York State (US). MOCA was awarded .museum top-level domain (TLD) status by the Museum Domain Management Association (MuseDoma) in 2002 and is now hosted on the Web. WebMuseum, Paris – founded online in 1994 as the WebLouvre, before being required to change its name. A pioneering virtual or online museum, it was created by Nicholas Pioch with images digitized from books and other public-domain sources. It is now hosted by ibiblio.[14] The Lin Hsin Hsin Art Museum – online 1994. An early virtual art museum website by the Singaporean artist Lin Hsin Hsin.[15][16][17][18][19] The Israel Museum, Jerusalem – first launched in 1995, Hebrew pages 1996.[20] The Museum of the History of Science in Oxford – opened 1683, online 21 August 1995. Now the History of Science Museum, it was the earliest physical museum to inaugurate a programme of virtual exhibitions with detailed collections-based content and high-resolution images of paintings, books, instruments and other artworks and artefacts. Located in the oldest surviving purpose-built museum building in the world, it was able to initiate a website relatively early because of the networking facilities and expertise available in the university environment, pages created by staff-member Giles Hudson.[21][22] The site was mounted on Oxford University's 'Sable' UNIX mainframe, occupied 150MB and GIFs were used as not all browsers supported JPEGs at the time.[23] Virtual Museum of Computing – founded 1995.[24] This is an eclectic collection of links and online resources concerning the history of computers and computer science. The Natural History Museum, London, first United Kingdom national museum with a web server, online in 1995.[25] The Science Museum in London – founded 1857, online 1995.[26] One of the major science museums in the world was able to establish an early web presence partly due to the proximity of Imperial College, but was also spurred on by the fact that the Natural History Museum, which is next door, had recently established the first dedicated museum web server in the United Kingdom. Virtual Museum of New France – online 1997. Established by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation. Asia Society Virtual Gallery – online 1998. Created for the exhibition \"More Than Meets the Eye\".[27] The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County – founded 1910, online 1998. The museum is the largest natural and historical museum in the Western United States and an active research center. WebExhibits – founded 1999, online 1999. WebExhibits is an interactive, web-based museum that encourages visitors to think about and explore scientific and cultural phenomena in new ways.[28] Exhibits include \"Investigating Bellini's Feast of the Gods,\" \"Causes of Color,\" \"Color Vision & Art,\" Pigments through the Ages,\" \"Butter,\" \"Van Gogh's Letters,\" and \"Poetry through the Ages,\" \"Calendars through the Ages,\" and \"Daylight Saving Time.\" Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci – founded 1954, online 1996. The National Museum of Science and Technology, online since 1996, launched in 1999 an online 3D virtual cooperative environment, the first of its kind in the museum world.[29] Ljubljana: Open-Air Museum – founded 1993, online 1996. Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was presented as a huge museum where streets were the exhibitions of the architecture and building interiors were museum rooms. The method of the presentation was interactive maps and interactive virtual reality panoramas.[30] The aim of the project was to create \"3D like\" virtual visit of the museum and replacing and documenting the \"reality\" exhibition after it was discontinued in its original \"reality form\". After 1996, the project was extended to \"Virtual museums of Slovenia\", covering all museums in the country, totalling over 106 museum exhibitions.[31][32] Further development of the \"Virtual museum\"[33] developed to project City View documenting natural and cultural heritage of the country with over 10,000 locations added by 2006. The Thylacine Museum – online 1999. The Thylacine Museum[34] is an online scientific and educational resource aimed at promoting a greater awareness and understanding of the biology, behaviour and history of the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus). Other online museums[edit] This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation.

At one end of the spectrum, museums may provide simple contact and background information plus a list of exhibitions (brochure museums). On the other end of the spectrum, there are museums that exist only online, or those that have a physical building but offer extensive online exhibits, interactive online features, multimedia, and searchable or browsable collections (content museums, learning museums, virtual museums).[35] The following are a few other museums online: Carnamah Historical Society is an Australian historical society whose Virtual Museum: to be known and distinguished as Carnamah won a Museums and Galleries National Award in 2014.[36] Central Illinois' On-Line Broadcast Museum is virtual museum that documents, in detail, the history of television stations broadcasting in Central Illinois.[37] GLBT History Museum of Central Florida is an organization founded in 2005 that hosts a virtual museum and organizes mobile displays.[38] Google Arts & Culture is an online compilation of high-resolution images of artworks from galleries worldwide, as well as a virtual tour of the galleries in which they are housed. The project was launched on 1 February 2011 by Google, and includes works in the Tate Gallery, London; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; and the Uffizi, Florence.[39] International Museum of Women is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about women's issues globally as well as an online community. Online exhibitions include \"Imagining Ourselves\" (launched 2006) about women's identity, \"Women, Power and Politics\" (2008), and \"Economica: Women and the Global Economy\" (2009).[citation needed] International New Media Gallery (INMG) is an online museum specialising in moving image and screen-based art.

Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art is the VMMNA is the first of its kind in Africa. Hosted by the Pan-African University, Lagos, Nigeria this virtual museum offers a good view of the development on Nigerian Art in the past fifty years.[citation needed] Virtual Museum of Soviet Repression in Belarus presents recordings of audio- and video-recollections of witnesses of Soviet repression in Belarus. The museum is operated by historians and other scientists from Belarus, based on a private initiative. It started collection of materials in 2007 and is operable since 2014.[50] Western Australian Museum is a CyberMuseum using social media sites of Twitter and Facebook to tell the history of Perth, Western Australia, through photographs, videos and news feeds.[51][52] The Fortnite Holocaust Museum, a virtual museum in the video game Fortnite Creative dedicated to the Holocaust, was launched in August 2023.[53] Research and scholarship[edit] The digitalization of museums is a task that has combined efforts, budgets and research from many museums, cultural associations and governments around the world. For the last few years, there have been projects related to Information Society Technologies dealing with: preservation of cultural heritage, restoration and learning resources. Some examples of contributions in the field of digital and virtual museography: Euromuse.net (EU), DigiCULT (EU), Musings, Digital Museums Projects. European Community has founded various projects to support this filed, like V-Must, the Virtual Museum Transnational Network that aims to provide the heritage sector with the tools and support to develop Virtual Museums that are educational, enjoyable, long-lasting and easy to maintain.[54] A notable example of research work on digitizing information to replenish museum collections can be the conversion into digital format of information archived in display holograms.[55] In 2017, Virtual Multimodal Museum continues to explore the core concept of the virtual museum where the Working group 1.1 is actively working towards re-defining the definition of the virtual museum in order to keep up with current research. An international conference in the field of museums and their websites is the annual Museums and the Web conference. In 2004, Roy Hawkey of King's College London reported that \"Virtual visitors to museum websites already out-number physical (on-site) visitors, and many of these are engaged in dedicated learning\".[56] In establishing virtuality and promoting cultural development, the goal is not merely to reproduce existing objects, but to actualize new ones. Information and communication technologies are not merely tools for processing data and making it available, but can be a force and stimulus for cultural development.[57] Interactive environments[edit] A user avatar moving around a 3D virtual museum. There are several types of interactive environments. One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides a sense of place using various spatial references. They usually use 3D modelling, VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) and now X3D(successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, X-ray imaging, 3D laser scanning, IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of EU-funded projects, the ViHAP3D, a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers.[citation needed] Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is QTVR. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited. Mobile telepresence[edit] In 2013, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) trialled a virtual museum tour system that uses mobile telepresence technology and requires a high-speed broadband connection. The technology allows remote visitors, for example school students from regional and remote Australia, to interact with a museum facilitator through a robot equipped with an omni-directional camera. Each remote visitor is able to control their own view of the museum gallery.[58][59][60] Domain names[edit] Museums have a variety of top-level domain names. In the United States, many are .org. Some are .gov, or governmental domains for other countries. A few are .edu in the US, either as part of a larger educational institution, or grandfathered in when .edu regulations changed (e.g., as with the Exploratorium). The .museum domain name is used by some museums, as organized by MuseDoma, but is not widely used.[61] Prospects of development[edit] Depending on the scientific position of the researchers, industry or instrumental use, virtual museums are regarded and used in different ways. For example, as a kind of creative activity; an innovative educational tool; a fashion or advertising project; а room with multimedia capabilities; the representation of the traditional Museum on the Internet; a gadget; the publication; website; type of communication; the electronic catalogue, etc.[62] See also[edit] Virtual Library museums pages Museology References[edit] ^ \"Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Establishes Licensing Agreement with Frank Lloyd Wright Virtual Museum in Second Life\".

Some kinds of blocks restrict editing from specific service providers or telecom companies in response to recent abuse or vandalism, and can sometimes affect other users who are unrelated to that abuse. Review the information below for assistance if you do not believe that you have done anything wrong. The IP address or range 34.28.0.0/16 has been blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s): The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked because it is believed to be a web host provider or colocation provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts and colocation providers may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host or colocation provider because it hides your IP address, much like a proxy or VPN. We recommend that you attempt to use another connection to edit. For example, if you use a proxy or VPN to connect to the internet, turn it off when editing Wikipedia. If you edit using a mobile connection, try using a Wi-Fi connection, and vice versa. If you are using a corporate internet connection, switch to a different Wi-Fi network. If you have a Wikipedia account, please log in. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption. How to appeal if you are confident that your connection does not use a colocation provider's IP address: If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: {{unblock|reason=Caught by a colocation web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. My IP address is _______. Place any further information here. ~~~~}}. You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system. There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator. This block will expire on 12:34, 25 May 2025. Your current IP address is 34.28.91.204. Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page, as well as email administrators and other editors.

A department of the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of Greater Pittsburgh, the museum is located in the Squirrel Hill JCC at the corner Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, in the heart of Pittsburgh's historically Jewish neighborhood. The museum was founded in 1998, and though it does not have a permanent collection, it hosts several original and traveling exhibitions each year. The AJM aims to explore contemporary Jewish issues through art and related programs that facilitate intercultural dialogue.[1] History[edit] Prior to 1998, the JCC of Greater Pittsburgh had a small community gallery for nearly 25 years. Under the auspices of Leslie A. Golomb Archived 2010-05-14 at the Wayback Machine, the gallery underwent a period of substantial growth, evolving into a museum and receiving accreditation from the Council of American Jewish Museums (CAJM).[2] Accreditation by CAJM requires strict adherence to standards regarding archives, catalogues, and curating, as well as educational programs and outreach. Today, the AJM galleries are still located on the Pittsburgh JCC's Squirrel Hill campus. While the AJM continues to emphasize the Pittsburgh community in its exhibitions and programming, its scope has grown as it collaborates with regional, national, and international artists and organizations. Additionally, the AJM frequently explores Jewish themes such as contemporary iterations of rituals, but aims to reach the wider community though exhibits with broad appeal and programming that encourages interfaith discourse. Recent exhibitions[edit] As a non-collecting museum, the AJM works with local, national, and international artists to create original exhibitions,[3] and occasionally hosts traveling exhibitions from institutions such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.[4] Here is a list of recent, notable exhibitions: 2017: Hill District Paintings.[5] Rochelle Blumenfeld 2011: Legacy.[6] A Painter's Legacy: The Students of Samuel Rosenberg (artist) 2010: Between Heaven and Earth.[7] Ilene Winn Lederer[8] 2010: To Speak Her Heart.[9] Leslie A.

In 2010, about 40% of Squirrel Hill's residents were Jewish.[6] According to a 2002 study by the United Jewish Federation, 33% of the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh lives in Squirrel Hill, and another 14% lives in the surrounding neighborhoods.[7] The report states that: \"The stability of Squirrel Hill, a geographic hub of the Jewish community located within the city limits, is unique in North America.\" Asian/Chinese community[edit] Per the October 17, 2019 issue of Pittsburgh Magazine, the area is also becoming Pittsburgh's new Chinatown with an influx of mainland Chinese students from Carnegie Mellon University.[8] The area celebrates Chinese New Year annually with a parade.[9] The area as of 2017 was about 17% Asian.[10] History[edit] Origins[edit] The name \"Squirrel Hill\" may have been given to the area by the Native Americans who lived in its vicinity.[11] The neighborhood most likely was named for the abundance of black squirrels.[12] The growth and development of Squirrel Hill was initially focused on the riverfront along the Monongahela River. The first recorded house was built in 1760 by a soldier at nearby Fort Pitt, Colonel James Burd, at a place called Summerset on the Monongahela River. Squirrel Hill's next house was built by Ambrose Newton some time in the 1760s. This house is still standing and is located in what is now Schenley Park along Overlook Drive (near the ice skating rink). Its first \"business district\" was the intersection of Brown's Hill Road and Beechwood Boulevard. In 1778, John Turner built his estate of Federal Hill nearby (along what is now Beechwood Boulevard). He later established the Turner cemetery in 1838 inside his estate, which he donated to the local community when he died in 1840.[11] This cemetery holds the remains of many of the original settlers of Squirrel Hill. The Mary S. Brown Memorial Methodist church was also built on adjoining lands donated by Turner. This church was rebuilt several times, but the current building, which dates from 1908, is the oldest standing church in Squirrel Hill.[13] The third house in Squirrel Hill, Neill Log House, was built by Robert Neill around 1765, also in what is now Schenley Park. This house still exists and is occasionally open to the public. The Neills owned 262 acres (1.06 km2) of land in the northern section of Schenley Park. In 1795, the Neills moved from this house to a location in what is now Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. After they died, the house was handed down to two different people before it was sold to General James O'Hara. O'Hara's granddaughter, Mary Schenley, gave the property to the city of Pittsburgh in 1889. For a time, the house was rented out by the city to vacationers, but by 1969, the house was in such poor condition that it was dismantled and rebuilt by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. It still exists and is open for tours during the Vintage Grand Prix in July. Around 1820, William \"Killymoon\" Stewart built one of the first tavern/inns in the area. His tavern, located near the intersection of Beechwood and Brown's Hill Road, survived for over 100 years. Slowly, Squirrel Hill became a prosperous and affluent suburb. Around 1840,[14] the Murdoch family started[15][16] a farm and nursery business in the part of Squirrel Hill North which is known today as Murdoch Farms.[17][18][19] Today, this quiet area contains many upscale homes. By the 1860s, the area along Fifth Avenue near Woodland Road had several mansions, including Willow Cottage. The cottage was built by the industrialist and civic leader Thomas M. Howe, a bank president and member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1851 to 1855. Though neglected for many years and almost torn down, Willow Cottage has recently undergone a $2.2 million restoration and renovation into a Chatham University gatehouse and guesthouse. Civil War[edit] On December 24, 1860, protests broke out in the streets of Squirrel Hill after news arrived that the U.S. Secretary of War, John B. Floyd had ordered 124 cannons to be shipped from Allegheny Arsenal to two forts under construction in Louisiana and Texas.[20] The inhabitants of Pittsburgh predicted that these weapons would be used against them if the South seceded, and this did indeed happen at Fort Sumter.[21] Incorporation into Pittsburgh[edit] Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill, looking north near Darlington Road, circa 1937. The electric trolley lines are clearly visible running down the center of the street.Prior to 1868, the Squirrel Hill area was part of Peebles Township. This changed in 1868, when the area was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh. Following the Civil War, several of Pittsburgh's richest families built multiple houses in the Woodland Road area between Fifth and Wilkins Avenues. In 1869, a women's college, the predecessor to Chatham University, was established nearby. Today, Chatham University owns several of these large houses. In 1869, the clubhouse of the Pittsburgh Golf Club was built at the new Schenley Park Golf Course (The present building by Alden and Harlow was constructed in 1900.) In 1876, the Homewood Cemetery was established on 176 acres (0.71 km2) of land in Squirrel Hill.[11] Over the course of the 19th century, the focus of Squirrel Hill shifted from its riverfront at the Monongahela River to the area closest to Oakland and Shadyside. Ebdy's orchard was located near Shady Avenue and Murdoch's farm, known for its flowers, fruit trees, and vegetable trees was located on the hill above Oakland. By the late 1800s, the building of trolley lines caused a migration of wealthy executives outwards toward country estates and workers inward toward trolley lines. Farms were sold, and divided for new housing developments.[22] Inside the Squirrel Hill Tunnel, which runs underneath the southern half of Squirrel Hill The growth of Squirrel Hill accelerated when an electric trolley was installed in 1893.[11] The trolley line ran via Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, terminating in Homestead. The trolley line facilitated the building of hundreds of houses for the middle management of local factories, especially on Shady and Denniston Avenues near Aylesboro. Despite its trolley line, Murray Avenue remained a dirt road until 1920. Murray Avenue carried three Pittsburgh Railways trolley lines (#69 Squirrel Hill, #60 East Liberty-Homestead and #68 Homestead-Duquesne-Kennywood-McKeesport) until 1958 when the trolleys were replaced by buses. Bus routes 61A, 61B, 61C, 61D, 64, 67, and 69 pass through the area today. Squirrel Hill grew even more with the opening of the Boulevard of the Allies in 1927, providing a direct link to downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1930s, most of the available land in Squirrel Hill had been filled. In 1953, the Parkway and Squirrel Hill Tunnel were opened. They gave the area easier and quicker access from surrounding neighborhoods.[11] Cultural life[edit] Squirrel Hill's business area along Forbes and Murray avenues is referred to as \"upstreet\" (a contraction of \"up the street\") by locals. In addition to the many retail businesses in the neighborhood, there are a number of longtime, non-profit organizations, including a branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh,[23] the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Pittsburgh,[23][24] the Children's Institute of Pittsburgh,[23] and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition.[25] Many annual events are hosted in Squirrel Hill by various community organizations. Parks[edit] Chatham University Arboretum, located in the north of Squirrel Hill Squirrel Hill contains several nature-related points of interest. They include the Chatham University Arboretum, originally belonging to Andrew Mellon; Schenley Park; and Frick Park. In 1889, Schenley Park was established on land donated from Mary Schenley, whose grandfather had been the owner of considerable amounts of land in the area. The original size of the park was 120 acres (0.49 km2), though it eventually expanded to 456 acres (1.85 km2) over the years.[11] When Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, he bequeathed 150 acres (0.61 km2) of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park. He provided a $2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park. Frick Park on the eastern border of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood opened in 1927. Between 1919 and 1942, money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park, increasing its size to almost 600 acres (2.4 km2). In February 2004, Frick Park grew with the addition of the Nine Mile Run stream restoration area which flows to the Monongahela River. The United States Army Corps of Engineers managed the restoration funded with $5 million in federal money and $2.7 million raised by the city.[26] The restoration was completed in 2006. Jewish community[edit] See also: History of the Jews in Pittsburgh The origins of Squirrel Hill's Jewish community dates from the 1920s when Eastern European Jews began to move to the neighborhood in large numbers from Oakland and the Hill District. Many of them took up residence in rows of brick houses on the cross streets of Murray Avenue south of Forbes, such as Darlington Road, Bartlett Street, and Beacon Street. The neighborhood became the center of Jewish culture in the city, with kosher butcher shops, delicatessens, Jewish restaurants, bookstores, and designer boutiques. Several hundred Russian Jewish immigrants moved to the neighborhood in the 1990s.[6] A 2017 study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, conducted by researchers at Brandeis University and commissioned by the local Jewish Federation, found that 26% of Pittsburgh-area Jews live in Squirrel Hill, 20% live in the South Hills, 9% live in the North Hills, 31% live in other areas of Pittsburgh, and 14% live in other areas of the region. Although Squirrel Hill remains the traditional center of Jewish life in the region, the study found a shift to more suburban areas. The study also found an increase in the population of Jews who identify as Orthodox or secular, and a decrease in the number of Jews who identify as Conservative and Reform denominations.[27] This feature of Squirrel Hill and surrounding Jewish communities, sustained locations of Jewish life across time and denominations, makes the area unusual compared to Jewish life in other cities. Elsewhere, Jews tended to migrate in waves to suburban areas during the twentieth century, and more geographic separation exists between denominations compared to Pittsburgh.[28] All of Squirrel Hill, as well as much of the adjoining neighborhoods of Greenfield and Regent Square, is within an eruv, a symbolic enclosure that allows Orthodox Jews to carry items or push a stroller on Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), during which certain activities are not permitted.[29] Moving items from private domain to a public domain is not permitted on Shabbat, so an eruv creates a single, private shared space, and carrying within it is permitted.[29] The irregular boundaries of the eruv are such that, as one writer noted, \"an Orthodox Jew could carry something within the eruv's boundaries all the way from the north end of the Hot Metal Bridge to the intersection of Wilkins and South Dallas in Point Breeze.\"[30] Squirrel Hill contains three Jewish day schools: two are affiliated with the Chabad and Modern Orthodox movements, respectively,[31][32] while Community Day School is a co-ed, independent Jewish day school in the neighborhood that attracts families across the wide spectrum of Jewish belief and practice.[33] Antisemitic attacks[edit] Main article: Murder of Neal Rosenblum On April 17, 1986, Neal Rosenblum, a 24-year-old rabbinical student visiting from Toronto, was shot and killed near his in-laws' house in Squirrel Hill.[34] A suspect, 45-year-old Steven M. Tielsch, was arrested in 2000[34] after bragging to a fellow prison inmate that he had killed a Jew.[35] Tielsch's first three trials ended in a deadlocked jury; he was convicted of third-degree murder in a fourth trial in 2002.[36] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the decision in 2007.[36] Main article: Pittsburgh synagogue shooting On October 27, 2018, Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha synagogue during Shabbat morning services and opened fire, killing 11 people and injuring six, including four police officers.[37] Education[edit] Carnegie Mellon University Public schools[edit] The Free Public School Act of 1834 ordered school districts not only to establish free schools but also to establish them in townships outside city limits.[38] This affected Squirrel Hill, since it was part of Peebles Township at the time. John Turner, who never learned to read or write but became a wealthy landowner, left land and money to the community to build a school when he died in 1844 at the age of 83. It was called Squirrel Hill School and was located on Bigelow Street at Hazelwood Avenue in the Greenfield neighborhood. Its successor closed in 1915 and was replaced by Roosevelt School, named for then-president Theodore Roosevelt. It closed in 1957. It was replaced by John Minadeo Elementary School, named for a ninth-grade school crossing guard who gave his life to save a group of young students in the path of a runaway car near Gladstone School.[39][40] The Wightman School closed in 1980, and the building is now used as a community center. After Peebles Township was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868, Squirrel Hill became the Colfax School District, named for Schuyler Colfax, who was Vice President of the United States under President Ulysses S. Grant. The district had five numbered schools. Colfax No. 1 was located at Phillips Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard. Today, it is Pittsburgh Colfax K-8. Colfax No. 2 was on Beechwood Boulevard near the intersection of Saline Street and Hazelwood Avenue near Browns Hill Road. It closed in 1907 but was reopened in 1916 as the Roosevelt School Annex when Roosevelt became overcrowded. The annex closed in 1939. Colfax No. 3, on Forward Avenue, became Forward Avenue School and was named after Walter Forward, who was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler. The school was torn down in 1923, but its retaining wall still exists under the Parkway East bridge over Saline Street. Colfax No. 4, at Whipple and Commercial streets, became Swisshelm School and was named for Jane Swisshelm, a writer and abolitionist. Colfax No. 5, at Solway and Wightman streets, became Wightman School and was named for Thomas Wightman, owner of the Thomas Wightman Glass Company. Wightman operated as a school from 1897 to 1980 and since then has been used as a community center building and the home of Carriage House Children's Center. The building underwent extensive restoration and remodeling to make it one of only two older buildings in Western Pennsylvania to have LEED Gold certification.[40] Taylor Allderdice High School Two other public elementary schools existed in Squirrel Hill. Brown School was built near the Monongahela River in 1888 on land donated by the Brown family. It closed in 1932. H.B. Davis School, named for a principal of the Frick Training School for Teachers, was located on Phillips Avenue. It opened in 1931 and closed in 1980.[41] Squirrel Hill's Taylor Allderdice High School opened in 1927.[42] It was named for the president of the National Tube Company, who was also a member of the Pittsburgh Public Schools Board of Education, which was created in 1911 and given jurisdiction over all the public schools in the city, including those in Squirrel Hill.[40] Private schools[edit] Some private schools located in Squirrel Hill are St. Edmund's Academy, a private nonsectarian (formerly Episcopal) elementary school; Community Day School, a co-ed, independent Jewish day school for students ages 3 to grade 8; Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh; and Yeshiva Schools of Pittsburgh. The Day School at the Children's Institute of Pittsburgh serves children with a wide range of special needs. Higher education[edit] Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Chatham University are located in Squirrel Hill, although many of CMU's buildings are in Oakland. CMU borders Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, while Chatham borders Shadyside. Local government[edit] The neighborhood is represented on Pittsburgh City Council by Barb Warwick (District 5, Squirrel Hill South) and Erika Strassburger (District 8, Squirrel Hill North).

It is the largest museum in North America dedicated to a single artist.[4] The museum holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives from the Pittsburgh-born pop art icon Andy Warhol. The Andy Warhol Museum is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and is a collaborative project of the Carnegie Institute, the Dia Art Foundation and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWFVA).[5] Warhol Self Portrait Exhibit in 2010 The museum is located in an 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) facility on seven floors. Containing 17 galleries, the museum features 900 paintings, close to 2,000 works on paper, over 1,000 published unique prints, 77 sculptures, 4,000 photographs, and over 4,350 Warhol films and videotaped works. Its most recent operating budget (2010) was $6.1 million. In addition to its Pittsburgh location the museum has sponsored 56 traveling exhibits that have attracted close to nine million visitors in 153 venues worldwide since 1996.[6] History[edit] Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989,[7] about 2½ years after Warhol's death. At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation.[7] Thomas N. Armstrong III, who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993.[8] Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work.[9] By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million,[8] a donation that grew to about 3,000 works.[4] On May 13–14, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend.[4] Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had \"tense relations\" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation.[4] On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum.[10] In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan, New York City, in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side, an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017.[11][12][13][14] [15] However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex.[16] In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed, based on Warhol's 1975 book, “The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again”, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh.[17] In 2022, the museum announced a $60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits.[18] The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet (17,500 square meters), including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces.[19] The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations.[20] In popular culture[edit] Display of Interview magazine covers The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event. The film's subject was hosting the event. The Andy Warhol Diaries (TV series) in 2022 prominently featured museum staff as narrators of Warhol's life.[21] See also[edit] List of single-artist museums Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art, Medzilaborce, Slovakia References[edit] ^ \"Patrick Moore named new Warhol Museum director\". ^ \"Andy Warhol Museum Shuffles Operations Staff, Names New Chief Curator\".

Its zip code is 15212. It is home to Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, and The Andy Warhol Museum. History and features[edit] Developing rapidly around and between the two stadiums, the neighborhood has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by council members for District 1 (North Neighborhoods) and 6 (North Shore/Downtown Neighborhoods). Two new light rail stations opened in the spring of 2012. The North Side station is located beside PNC Park and near the north portal of the Allegheny River Tunnel. Allegheny station is located by Acrisure Stadium and is the current western terminus of the line. Future development[edit] In October 2014, two 11-story office skyscrapers were proposed for the area by local parking lot manager Alco Parking. The project is likely to move forward, as soon as an anchor tenant can be found.[2][3] Surrounding and adjacent Pittsburgh neighborhoods[edit] North Shore runs along the Allegheny River and its confluence with the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River. It is bordered by Chateau to the west, Allegheny West to the northwest, Allegheny Center to the north, East Allegheny to the northeast, and Troy Hill to the east. The Roberto Clemente, Andy Warhol, and Rachel Carson Bridges provide direct links to Downtown Pittsburgh as do the first southbound exits across the Veterans and Fort Duquesne Bridges.

Williams, Perkins and WillWebsiteaacc-awc.org The 2009 grand opening The stage The August Wilson African American Cultural Center is a U.S. nonprofit arts organization based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that presents performing and visual arts programs that celebrate the contributions of African Americans not only in Western Pennsylvania, but nationally and internationally. The August Wilson African American Cultural Center building is on Liberty Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh's Cultural District. It includes galleries, classrooms, a 500-seat theater, a gift shop, a cafe, and many multi-purpose spaces for visual and performing art. The museum opened in 2009. History[edit] The August Wilson Center was part of a plan drawn up by Pittsburgh NAACP President Tim Stevens in 1996 in order to try to bring the National NAACP Convention to Pittsburgh. In the plan, there was a statement that urged the Mayor of Pittsburgh to provide financial backing for an African American Museum. Later in 1996, then-Mayor Tom Murphy charged two City Council Members, Sala Udin and Valerie McDonald with bringing stakeholders together to discuss the museum's future. Funding from various sources, including the URA, State of Pennsylvania, and The Heinz Endowments came together to begin construction of the center. The land on which the center sits was taken by eminent domain and sold to the museum for $1. The center celebrated its \"topping off\" ceremony on August 12, 2008, at 12:30 pm. Construction was completed shortly thereafter and the museum was open to the full public on September 17 and 19, 2009.[1] The August Wilson Center was designed under the direction of Allison G. Williams, FAIA and members of her team from her San Francisco office of Perkins and Will. During the design of this project, AI merged with MBT Architecture and then was subsequently bought by Perkins+Will. The project design was completed in the San Francisco office of Perkins+Will. Team members included Greg Lehman, Sally Curtis, Stacie Velten.[2] In February 2019, the August Wilson Center for African American Culture (the center's original name) changed its name to the August Wilson Cultural Center,[3] and the following month, to the August Wilson African American Cultural Center (the latter change, following an online petition objecting to the deletion of \"African American\" from its name).[4] Debt troubles[edit] The center struggled to pay off its construction debt from 2012, on January 20, 2014, a federal bankruptcy official reported that the center's debt situation might be irreversible.[5] Subsequently, a federal court ruled on January 27, 2014, that the center's liquidation could begin to pay off debts.[6] In February 2014 concerned stakeholders started a website to raise funds for the center.[7] After numerous court cases, the center was sold at a sheriff's sale on November 3, 2014, to the mortgage holder, Dollar Bank for $1,912.50.[8] On November 5, 2014 Dollar Bank sold the center to a nonprofit consortium for $7.9 million. The consortium included contributions from private foundations: $2.45 million from the Heinz Endowments, $2.35 million from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, $500,000 from the Pittsburgh Foundation and $500,000 from the Thomas Tull Family Foundation. Public sources contributed another $3.15 million: $1.65 million from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and $1.5 million from the Allegheny Regional Asset District.[9] The court-appointed conservator had originally agreed to sell the building for $9.5 million to a private developer, 980 Liberty Partners, who had planned to build a hotel on top of the center. Pittsburgh Major Bill Peduto, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and the URA fought the bid. 980 Liberty Partners withdrew in a September 2014 settlement that favored the consortium of local foundations. 980 Liberty partners was reimbursed $360,000 from URA's share of the purchase price.[9] By 2019, the center was on a solid financial foundation, having ended 2018 with a budget surplus and was building a capital reserve.[10] By 2020, the center was showing additional signs of recovery, having increased its operating budget to $7.25 million from $1.77 million in 2015 and increased the percentage of the budget coming from earned income to 17% from 5%. The center had greatly increased its individual donor base and held substantially more events.[11] References[edit] ^ \"August Wilson Center for African American Culture\".

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: \"Cultural District, Pittsburgh\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (January 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The Cultural District is a fourteen-square-block area in Downtown Pittsburgh bordered by the Allegheny River on the north, Tenth Street on the east, Stanwix Street on the west, and Liberty Avenue on the south. The Cultural District features six theaters offering some 1,500 shows annually, as well as art galleries, restaurants, and retail shops. Its landmarks include Allegheny Riverfront Park, the Benedum Center, the Byham Theater, the Harris Theater, Heinz Hall, the O'Reilly Theater, Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School, the Three Rivers Arts Festival Gallery, the Wood Street Galleries, and the August Wilson Center for African American Culture. Major arts organizations based here include the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, the Pittsburgh Dance Council, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Public Theater, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Bricolage Production Company, and Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company. History[edit] The cultural district was the brainchild of H. J. Heinz II (1908–1987), known as Jack Heinz, and is managed by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust was formed in 1984 to realize Jack's vision of an entire cultural district for blocks of the Penn–Liberty Avenue corridor, which then was a blighted area. Transforming Loew's Penn Theatre into Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts[edit] Heinz Hall (formerly Loew's Penn Theatre) Built as the Loew's and United Artists' Penn Theatre, construction of the building was completed in 1927. Motion picture business magnate and pioneer Marcus Loew engaged the architectural firm of Rapp & Rapp to design the movie palace. The Grand Lobby was particularly impressive, with its 50-foot-high (15 m) vaulted Venetian ceiling, massive ornamental columns, marble staircase, bronze and crystal chandeliers and silk drapes. Like many 1920s-era film palaces, Loew's Penn Theatre fell on hard times in the 1960s. Competition from television and suburban theaters along with high maintenance costs put a squeeze on profitability. The theater shut its doors in 1964 and was scheduled for demolition. Henry J. Heinz II and Charles Denby, President of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society, together with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Allegheny Conference and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, purchased the site and rescued the theater for the purpose of creating a new home for the Pittsburgh Symphony. Jack Heinz and others, including his son, United States Senator from Pennsylvania John Heinz, and William Rea, began the changes that would follow in the district with the purchase and renovation of the former movie palace, Loew's Penn Theater, which was then transformed into the opulent and newly renamed Heinz Hall. This magnificent concert hall reopened after a complete restoration in 1971 as the new home for the Pittsburgh Symphony. The current seating configuration is 2,676. Heinz Hall is owned and operated by the Pittsburgh Symphony Society. The Stanley Theater becomes the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts[edit] The Benedum Center (formerly The Stanley Theatre) The Trust's first major project was the restoration of another visually stunning former movie palace, the Stanley Theater. The Stanley Theater was designed by the renowned theater architectural firm of Hoffman & Henon and opened on February 27, 1928. At the time, it had the distinction of being the largest theater in Western Pennsylvania, and was commonly known as \"Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement\". After a $43 million restoration returning it to its original splendor, it reopened in 1987 as the newly renamed Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, and is currently able to host about 2,885 people. The Benedum Center is owned and operated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Fulton Theater becomes the Byham Theater[edit] The Byham Theatre (formerly the Gayety Theatre). The Byham Theater, a landmark building at 101 Sixth Street in Downtown Pittsburgh, was the second major theater venue restoration project of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Built in 1903, the then called Gayety Theater was a stage and Vaudeville house, and it featured stars such as Ethel Barrymore, Gertrude Lawrence, and Helen Hayes. It was renamed The Fulton in the 1930s when it became a full-time movie theater. In 1990, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust bought the theater and refurbished the Fulton as part of its plan for the Cultural District. The Byham family of Pittsburgh made a major naming gift for a 1995 renovation, and it has been the Byham Theater since. The current seating configuration is 1,300. The Byham Center is owned and operated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Cultural District today[edit] Today the 14-square-block area continues to transform and flourish from a red-light district with only two cultural facilities—Heinz Hall and the Convention Center—to a dynamic arts and residential neighborhood with more than fourteen arts venues, including the Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School, public parks and plazas, and new commercial development. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust applies a holistic approach and vision to urban redevelopment: streetscaping programs, facade restorations, new cultural facilities, public open spaces and art projects. The Cultural District's transformation is widely praised and serves as a model for urban redevelopment through the arts. Brendan Lemon of The New York Times wrote, \"To describe Pittsburgh's unconventional, un-Disneyfied remodeling of its Cultural District ... is to explore how theater can help transform urban identity.\" The Cultural District is also home to the Pittsburgh Film Office, a non-profit organization that markets the greater southwestern Pennsylvania region as a great location for movie, television and commercial productions. Since its inception in 1990, the PFO has assisted more than 102 feature films and television productions to southwestern Pennsylvania to generate an economic impact of more than $575 million for the region.[1] Listing of theaters in the Cultural District[edit] Benedum Center (formerly the Stanley Theater) Byham Theater (formerly the Gayety Theater, then the Fulton Theater) Harris Theater (formerly Art Cinema) Heinz Hall (formerly Loew's Penn Theater) O'Reilly Theater (newly built in 1999) The August Wilson Center for African American Culture The Cabaret at Theatre Square Bricolage Production Company Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company Visual Arts in the Cultural District[edit] Wood Street Galleries Future Tenant SPACE 707-709 Penn Galleries Watercolors Gallery ToonSeum See also[edit] Theatre in Pittsburgh Theater portalArt portal References[edit] This article includes a list of general references, but it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.

It is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The museum is an active collection. The 650 m2 show room contains over 3,500 bicycles with an additional 27,000 in storage.[5] There are over 100,000 parts to keep the collection in repair.[6] Bicycle Heaven also serves as a bike shop, and consults as prop agents for film, television and theatrical productions. After filming, the bicycles are returned and become part of the permanent collection.[7][8] History[edit] Bicycle Heaven was founded in 2011. Exhibits[edit] Bowden Spacelanders[edit] Four of the last Bowden Spacelanders Benjamin Bowden, a British industrial designer, designed a space-age fiberglass bicycle in 1946. Bowden named the design the Spacelander; it entered production in 1960 and sold for $89.50.[9] Only 522 Spacelander bicycles were made in the original run.[10] By the 1990s only a few dozen were estimated to have survived. Morrow collected 17 of the proposed 38 left in the world.[11] The Bowden Spacelanders are some rarest bicycles in the museum. Given their scarcity and good condition, they are valued over $50,000 each.[12][13] Pee-Wee Herman's Bicycle[edit] One of the jewels of the museum is one of the prop bikes used as Pee-wee Herman's bicycle, the MacGuffin of the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure.[5][12][14] Other Movie Bicycles[edit] The museum displays bicycles used in the films A Beautiful Mind,[7] Fences, Super 8,[13] and others.

The museum's first gallery was opened for public viewing on November 5, 1895. Over the years, the gallery vastly increased in size, with a new building on Forbes Avenue built in 1907. In 1963, the name was officially changed to Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute. The size of the gallery has tripled over time, and it was officially renamed in 1986 to \"Carnegie Museum of Art\" to indicate it clearly as one of the four Carnegie Museums.[1] History[edit] Andrew Carnegie first thought of setting up a museum in 1886[2] that would preserve a \"record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America.\" Dedicated on November 5, 1895, the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's Main Branch in Oakland. Carnegie initially envisioned a museum collection consisting of the \"Old Masters of tomorrow\".[3] The museum received a major expansion in 1907 with the addition of the Hall of Architecture, Hall of Sculpture, and Bruce Galleries, with funds again provided by Carnegie.[4] Under the directorship of Leon A. Arkus, the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery (125,000 square feet) was built as an addition to the existing Carnegie Institute. Designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, it first opened in 1974 and more than doubled the museum's exhibition space, also adding a children's studio, theater, café, offices, and bookstore.[5] The New York Times art critic John Russell described the gallery as an \"unflawed paradise.\" The gallery has been renovated several times since its original creation, most recently in 2004. Today the museum also stages the Carnegie International every few years. Numerous significant works from the Internationals have been acquired for museum's permanent collection including Winslow Homer's The Wreck (1896) and James A. McNeill Whistler's Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate (1884). Collections and departments[edit] Neapolitan presepio seasonally displayed at the Carnegie Museum of Art The museum's curatorial departments include: Fine Arts (Contemporary Art, Works on Paper), Decorative Arts, Architecture and Photography. Every year, the museum hosts up to 15 different exhibitions. Approximately 35,000 pieces make up its permanent collection, which also includes works on paper, paintings, prints (particularly Japanese prints), sculptures, and installations from the late seventeenth century to the present. The museum has notably strong collections of both aluminum relics and chairs. Approximately 1,800 works are on view at any given time. The museum also maintains a large archive of negatives from African American photographer Charles \"Teenie\" Harris.[3] Heinz Architectural Center - The collection includes works in architecture, landscape design, engineering, and furniture and interior design. The center's facilities includes 4,000 square feet of exhibition space and a library housing several thousand books and journals. The Hillman Photography Initiative - The Initiative hosts a variety of projects including live public events, web-based projects, documentary videos, art projects, and writing. Yearly programming is determine by a group of five \"agents\" who plan and curate each 12-month cycle of works hosted.[6] Collection Themes Contemporary Glass Teenie Harris Photographs: Erroll Garner and Jazz from the Hill Carnegie International Japanese Prints Pittsburgh Artists The Art of the Chair Pictorialist Photography Painting and Sculpture 1860–1920 W.

It is the largest collection of plaster casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world, along with those of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Musée national des Monuments Français in Paris.[9] Hall of Sculpture (1907) – The Hall of Sculpture was modeled after the Parthenon's inner sanctuary and was originally created to house the museum's 69 plaster casts of Egyptian, Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman sculpture. Today it exhibits works from the permanent collections, with its balcony displaying decorative arts objects from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. Heinz Architectural Center (1993) – dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.[10] Scaife Galleries (1974) – The Scaife Galleries display the permanent collection of the museum,[11] and contains paintings, sculptures, works on paper, film, and video pieces. Forum Gallery – Located on the first floor of the museum just inside the Forbes Avenue entrance, this single room is dedicated to temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It opened November 3, 1990, with support from the National Endowment of the Arts – The first exhibition, Forum 1, was a solo show of Jeff Wall. Subsequent exhibitions were numbered sequentially (for example, Forum 40 featured Felix de la Concha). Unlike larger museum exhibitions, which can take up to three years to plan and execute, Forum shows come together relatively quickly, and are open to any curatorial staff's vision. In the words of Vicky Clark, a longtime curator at the museum, \"The idea was to make sure that we had an exhibition of contemporary art set up at all times.\"[12] Educational programs[edit] Saturday art classes in the galleries of the Carnegie Museum of Art have been conducted for over 75 years. Alumni of the program include Andy Warhol, photographer Duane Michals, and contemporary artist Philip Pearlstein. [citation needed] The museum has classes specific to various age groups.[13] Looted art controversy[edit] In 2023 the Manhattan District Attorney seized a drawing by Egon Schiele entitled Portrait of a Man within the framework of a criminal investigation concerning the Nazi-era looting of the collection of Fritz Grunbäum, who was murdered in the Holocaust.[14][15] Gallery[edit] Bronze ritualistic vessel, 1300–1150 BCE, Shang dynasty, China Stele of Vishnu with Avatars and attendant deities, 12th century, central India Housepost, c. 1930s, Yoruba culture, Africa Ancient Greco-Roman vase Casket for relics of a saint (châsse), 13th century, French Ivory portable altar, 14th century, French Armour, with Helmet, c. 1555, by Anton Peffenhauser View of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, 1846, oil on canvas, by William Coventry Wall Farallon Island, 1887, oil on canvas, by Albert Bierstadt Wheat Fields After the Rain (The Plain of Auvers), 1890, oil on canvas, by Vincent van Gogh Place des Lices, 1893, oil on canvas, by Paul Signac Steamboat on the Ohio, 1896, oil on canvas, by Thomas Pollock Anshutz Water Lilies (Nymphéas), 1915–1926, oil on canvas, by Claude Monet Miniature room box on display, Ruth McChesney Past directors[edit] John W.

Home to three universities, museums, hospitals, shopping venues, restaurants, and recreational activities, this section of the city also includes two city-designated historic districts: the mostly residential Schenley Farms Historic District and the predominantly institutional Oakland Civic Center Historic District, as well as the locally-designated Oakland Square Historic District. In addition, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire operates Fire Station No. 14 on McKee Place and Fire Station No. 10 on Allequippa Street.

Each section has a unique identity, and offers its own flavor of venues and housing. Oakland is Pittsburgh's second most populated neighborhood with 22,210 residents, a majority of these residents being students. Scattered amongst Oakland's four neighborhoods are 29 distinct flights of city steps – many of which are open and in a safe condition. These Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this densely populated area.[3] As of 2020, two of these public stairways, Joncaire Street (Central Oakland) and Louisa Street (West Oakland), also contain runnels which allow cyclists to easily transport a bike up or down the flight.

The Cathedral of Learning, the engineering or midsection of the University of Pittsburgh campus, and the Craig Street business district are in North Oakland. RAND's Pittsburgh center is located in North Oakland as well as the long time RIDC business incubator on Henry Street.[7] The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, the largest mosque in the city, is located in North Oakland.[8] This sector is also home to the Schenley Farms Historic District and many mid-rise condominium and apartment buildings. Central Oakland[edit] Central Oakland is bordered by Schenley Park, the Boulevard of the Allies, Fifth Avenue, and Halket Street. Many students at the University of Pittsburgh who decide to live off-campus reside in this neighborhood. Many of its homes are historic masonry structures dating from the turn of the century. The area is often confused with South Oakland. Its Main Business District runs along Forbes and Fifth Avenue, and contains a diversity of restaurants, retailers, and financial services. These businesses are organized by the Oakland Business Improvement District (OBID). Smaller business districts in Central Oakland provide additional dining options along Atwood Street and Semple Street. It is also the location of the relatively isolated and historic neighborhood of Panther Hollow which runs along Boundary Street in Junction Hollow as well as the Oakland Square Historic District. South Oakland[edit] South Oakland runs along the Monongahela River and forms a triangular shape between the Monongahela River, the Boulevard of the Allies, and the western bank of Junction Hollow. Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC and the Pittsburgh Technology Center are major landmarks of this neighborhood. The neighborhood is split between a riverfront flood plain to the southwest and a plateau to the northeast. The plateau is divided into two primarily residential areas which are separated from one another by Bates Street, which runs up a valley from the flood plain to the plateau. The residents of the neighborhood on the north side of Bates Avenue call their neighborhood Oakcliffe. The flood plain was previously packed with industrial sites such as the Pittsburgh Works Consolidated Gas Co. and the Jones & Laughlin Steel Co.,[9] but presently, the Pittsburgh Technology Center hosts facilities such as the Entertainment Technology Center of Carnegie Mellon University. Many residents of Central Oakland - as well as news outlets[10] - often consider their neighborhood part of South Oakland. However, the longstanding border between Central Oakland and South Oakland was established long ago along the Boulevard of the Allies. Forbes Avenue provides much of the neighborhood’s northern boundary. South Oakland is reputed to be a student neighborhood, but only 36.9% of its population is between the ages of 18 and 24, compared to Central Oakland's figure of 74.1%.[11] The difference is largely because the area between Forbes Avenue and the Boulevard of the Allies houses many undergraduate students. While it is commonly considered to be in South Oakland, it is actually the heart of Central Oakland. South Oakland was the childhood home of Andy Warhol, and later the residence of fellow pop artist Keith Haring. Haring had his first art show while living in Oakland. NFL Hall of Fame Quarterback Dan Marino was also born in Oakland, not far from Warhol's home. Dan Marino Field on Frazier Street was named in honor of its native son. Although they were not contemporaries, Warhol and Marino grew up on the same block with their former houses only a few doors apart. West Oakland[edit] West Oakland is bordered by Fifth Avenue in the south, DeSoto Street in the east, the Birmingham Bridge to the west, and Aliquippa Street to the north. While the smallest of the Oakland districts, the neighborhood hosts a range of commercial and residential dwellings. Among notable commercial operations exists Carlow University and most of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, including UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC Montefiore. The residential makeup is diverse and consists of a number of long-time, permanent residents living alongside students completing their undergrad and graduate degrees. Many permanent residents have called West Oakland home dating back to around 1990, when a program to incentivize first time home buyers actively brought the neighborhood to life. Entertainment and residential life has a catalyst through The Corner, which hosts social events of all kinds. Here you can find pop up art displays to jazz nights, afterschool programs, and more. Not Oakland[edit] Although the campus of Carnegie Mellon University and parts of Schenley Park, including Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and Flagstaff Hill are popularly referred to as being in Oakland, and are located with the 15213 zip code, they are actually part of the adjacent neighborhood of Squirrel Hill North. The border between Oakland and Squirrel Hill runs along Junction Hollow. History[edit] The name first appeared in 1839 in a local paper, Harris' Intelligencer. The area got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William Eichbaum, who settled there in 1840. Oakland developed rapidly following the Great Fire of 1845 in Downtown Pittsburgh, with many people moving out to suburban territory. By 1860, there was considerable commercial development along Fifth Avenue. In 1868, Oakland Township, just two years after seceding from Pitt Township, was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh.[12] Twenty-one years later, Mary Schenley gave the city 300 acres in Oakland for a park. Officials bought another 100 acres from her for \"Schenley Park.\" And Mary Schenley gave another gift: land for Schenley Plaza. At Schenley Plaza, industrialist Andrew Carnegie built a library, museum and concert hall complex, which opened in 1895. In 1917, Teddy Roosevelt visited the neighborhood.[13] Oakland has long been considered Pittsburgh's university center. Carnegie Mellon University is the result of a 1967 merger of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, founded in Oakland in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie, and Mellon Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon to conduct industrial research. The University of Pittsburgh, which is heir to the Pittsburgh Academy that was incorporated in 1787, relocated to Oakland in 1909 from its campus that was then in Allegheny. Some of the most impressive architecture in Oakland is on Pitt's campus. In 1925, work began on what was then the world's tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Although the Cathedral of Learning is now the fourth-tallest educationally purposed building in the world, it remains the world's second tallest university building, the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere,[14] and the second tallest gothic-styled building in the world.[15] Oakland is also home to the university's French-Gothic revival Heinz Memorial Chapel and St. Paul Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. It is also home of the main branch of the Carnegie Library, the Carnegie Museum, and Phipps Conservatory. Baseball fans might know Oakland for the beloved Forbes Field, which was built in 1909 as the third home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and first home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. While Forbes Field was closed in 1970, some remnants of the ballpark still stand. Pirates fans gather on the site each year on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski's World Series winning home run on October 13, 1960. The Decade nightclub was a staple of the neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s.[16] Surrounding neighborhoods[edit] North Oakland has eight borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Bloomfield to the northeast, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill North to the east, Central Oakland to the south, West Oakland to the southwest, the Terrace Village region of the Hill District to the west, the Upper Hill District to the northwest Polish Hill to the north-northwest. North Oakland also runs catty-corner (without a direct border) with Lower Lawrenceville to the north with its meeting point in the middle of the Bloomfield Bridge. Central Oakland has five Pittsburgh neighborhood borders, including North Oakland to the north, Squirrel Hill North to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, South Oakland to the south and southwest, and West Oakland to the northwest. South Oakland has six land borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Central Oakland to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, Greenfield to the southeast, Hazelwood to the south-southeast, Bluff to the west, and West Oakland to the northwest. Across the Monongahela River, South Oakland runs adjacent with Pittsburgh's South Side Flats neighborhood. West Oakland has six borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Oakland to the northeast, Central Oakland to the southeast, South Oakland to the south and south-southeast, Bluff to the southwest, and the Crawford-Roberts and Terrace Village regions of the Hill District to the west and northwest, respectively. Sites[edit] The neighborhood is the location of the massive Carnegie culture complex, originally funded by Andrew Carnegie, which includes the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Music Hall. Oakland is home to St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral, sponsor of the annual Greek Food Festival, as well as St. Paul Cathedral, mother church of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and the neighboring Pittsburgh Chinese Church, and St. George Orthodox Cathedral, the seat of the bishop of the Diocese of Charleston, Oakland, and the Mid-Atlantic.[17] Oakland's University of Pittsburgh Medical Center pioneered modern organ transplant surgery (home of Dr. Thomas Starzl). In 1955, the first effective polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Oakland was, at various points, the home of many professional Pittsburgh sports team, including the hockey Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL), Pittsburgh Steelers and the baseball Pittsburgh Pirates. They played at now-defunct venues such as the Duquesne Gardens, Pitt Stadium, and Forbes Field. The Pittsburgh Symphony and many touring plays and musical acts performed at the also now-defunct Syria Mosque. The Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera also called the neighborhood home, performing until 1961 at Pitt Stadium. The Pittsburgh Playhouse was founded in Oakland. WQED, Pittsburgh's PBS station and the first community-sponsored television station in the United States, has been located in Oakland since 1954, although it moved from its original building to a new, larger one in 1970. WQED's first building, which had originally been the manse of a neighboring church, is now the Music Building of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus. Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, the nationally syndicated children's show, was taped at WQED's studios in Oakland. WDTV-TV, now KDKA-TV, the region's first television station, went on the air at the Syria Mosque in Oakland on 11 January 1949. The event, aired on all four TV networks of the time DuMont, CBS, NBC, and ABC, was the first to \"network\" East Coast and Midwest TV stations into a modern \"television network\" of Pittsburgh and 13 other cities from Boston to St. Louis. Oakland is less than 3 miles (4.8 km) from Downtown Pittsburgh, and as a whole is bordered by Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, the Hill District, Greenfield, Bloomfield, and Bluff.

Carnegie established the International to educate and inspire the public as well as to promote international cooperation and understanding. He intended the International to provide a periodic sample of contemporary art from which Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art could enrich its permanent collection. History[edit] Established in 1896 as the Annual Exhibition,[7] the Carnegie International focused almost solely on painting until 1961. From 1955 through 1970, the show followed a triennial schedule; from 1961–1967, the exhibition was known as the Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture.[8] The first exhibition was selected by Carnegie Museum of Art director John. W. Beatty, on his own; after that, works were selected in consultation with a group of foreign advisory committees and a jury of award. In the first decade, the exhibition selection system was two-tiered: some artists were invited to participate directly, shipping their work straight to Pittsburgh and bypassing the selection process, while some were invited to submit works to a selection committee, often at their own expense.[citation needed] Exceptions include 1902, when the exhibition was a historical overview of well-known works by international artists; 1906, when the show was suspended to accommodate the enlargement of the museum; and a five-year hiatus between 1915 and 1919 due to World War I.[citation needed] After an interruption due to soaring costs[citation needed] and the construction of the Institute's new wing, the Sarah Scaife Gallery, the 1977 and 1979 exhibitions were rebranded as the International Series[citation needed], wherein single artists—Pierre Alechinsky, Willem de Kooning, and Eduardo Chillida—were featured. In 1982, it reappeared under a triennial survey format as the Carnegie International, and has been mounted every three to five years since. After the Venice Biennale, the Carnegie International is the oldest international survey exhibition in the world. Chronology[edit] 1896–1914[edit] The Carnegie Institute holds the \"annual exhibition\" for eighteen years, except in 1906, due to museum construction. 1920–1950[edit] Between 1920 and 1950, the Carnegie Institute held nineteen international exhibitions, with a hiatus during the Second World War and rebuilding of Europe. The Institute's second director, Homer Saint-Gaudens, instituted a new streamlined system whereby foreign representatives scouted promising works for his annual trips to Europe. Juries of award still included artists, but museum directors also served. Saint-Gaudens instituted the display of works by country during these years and introduced the Popular Prize, voted upon by the public, in 1924; he retired after the 1950 show.[citation needed] 1951–1969[edit] Between 1952 and 1969, Institute presented an international six times (1952, 1955, 1958, 1961, 1964, 1967). Gordon Bailey Washburn maintained his predecessor's use of foreign advisors, but dropped nationality as the organizing structure. He organized four Internationals, which were distinguished from larger competitors (the Venice Biennale and São Paulo Bienal) in press materials as the only international survey curated by a single person, \"one man’s view of contemporary art\" in a few hundred works. Concurrent with the 1958 International and in celebration of the Pittsburgh bicentennial, his assistant director, Leon Arkus, organized a retrospective exhibition including 95 paintings from previous editions. That year, Marcel Duchamp and Vincent Price sat on the jury of award.[citation needed] The 1964 and 1967 Internationals were organized by the Museum's fourth director, Gustave Von Groschwitz, in consultation with seven national correspondents based in Europe, whom he referred to as \"informal co-jurors\". Von Groschwitz returned to a nationality-based display structure and did away with numbered prizes, opting for six equal awards and several purchase prizes.[citation needed] 1970–1979[edit] The 1970, 1977, and 1979 Internationals were organized by fifth director, Leon Arkus. Arkus eliminated prizes for the 1970 show, and switched to a single-artist, retrospective format for the 1977 (Pierre Alechinsky) and 1979 (split between Eduardo Chillida and Willem de Kooning) shows, awarding a $50,000 prize each of those years.[citation needed] 1980–1990[edit] There were three internationals in the 1980s. John R. Lane became director in 1980, but hired curator Gene Baro to organize the 1982 International. This format has remained in place through all of the successive editions, with a twist in 1985, when Lane co-curated the exhibition with John Caldwell. All the curators since 1980, with the exception of Baro, have relied on the advice and/or assistance of advisory committees which also served on award-granting juries. The committees were most directly involved in the 1985 and 1988 shows, when the advisors were considered part of the curatorial team. The International was organized by John Caldwell in 1988; 1991–2010[edit] The International was curated by Lynn Cooke and Mark Francis in 1991, Richard Armstrong in 1995; Madeleine Grynsztejn in 1999; Laura Hoptman in 2004; and Douglas Fogle in 2008.[citation needed] Advisory committees in recent years have been composed of other curators, critics, and artists; committee members also participate in the jury of award, alongside the museum director and select trustees.[9] See also[edit] Art portal Carnegie Prize List of first prize winners at the exhibition.

It was founded by Pittsburgh-based industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1896. Housing some 22 million specimens, the museum features one of the most extensive paleontological and entomological collections in the world. As seen from the 36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning. Description and history[edit] The museum consists of 115,000 square feet (10,700 m2) organized into 20 galleries as well as research, library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and 63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools all around western Pennsylvania. The museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the fossils of Diplodocus carnegii.[1] Notable dinosaur specimens include one of the world's very few fossils of a juvenile Apatosaurus, the world's first specimen of a Tyrannosaurus rex,[2] and a recently identified species of oviraptorosaur named Anzu wyliei.[3] Research teams including former Carnegie scientists made critical discoveries such as Puijila darwini, Castorocauda lutrasimilis, and Hadrocodium wui. Portion of the dinosaur exhibit. Fossil fish Fossil specimen of Anaethalion knorri from the Solnhofen limestone Mummies from the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt. Other major exhibits include Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, Polar World: Wyckoff Hall of Arctic Life, Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, Benedum Hall of Geology, Dinosaurs in Their Time, and Powdermill Nature Reserve, established by the museum in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations. The museum's active curatorial departments are: Anthropology, Birds, Botany, Herpetology (Amphibians & Reptiles), Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammals, Minerals, Mollusks (Malacology), and Vertebrate Paleontology. These departments work collaboratively under strategic centers created to re-frame how the museum leverages its research, exhibitions, and public programming to meet the challenges and issues of today. In late 2013, however, the museum's parent organization and interim administration eliminated multiple scientific positions, seriously reducing its capacity to conduct original research. Scientific publications[edit] Gift shop inside Carnegie Museum of Natural History Carnegie Museum of Natural History publishes scholarly journals and books including Annals of Carnegie Museum, which offers peer-reviewed articles in organismal biology, earth sciences, and anthropology; Bulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural History, offering monographs or collections of related papers from symposia; and Special Publications of Carnegie Museum, documenting special topics or areas of research.

Kamin Science Center,[2][needs update] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Chateau[3] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium. Overview[edit] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year.[1][4] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as \"the biggest screen in Pittsburgh\"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University’s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema),[5] SportsWorks, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine). Updates[edit] According to Nicholas Efran, \"The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years.\" However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are \"Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building\"[6] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations.[7] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs.[8] In June 2022, § Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame, such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars, Maria from Metropolis, as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the § SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid, the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center’s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage \"until the Science Center decides what to do with it\".[5][9] History[edit] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science, which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States, and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger.[10] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.[11] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center[12] Roboworld (until 2022)[edit] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022.[9] It was touted as \"the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition\", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring \"all things robotic\".[13] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid, the Robothespian, an interactive, animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort.[14] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2, C-3PO, Data, the T-800 Terminator, R.O.B., Maschinenmensch, Gort, Robby the Robot, Robot B-9, HAL 9000, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running. Highmark SportsWorks[edit] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate.[15] The main idea of SportsWorks is \"to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports.\"[15] SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC, ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark. It reopened in the Fall of 2009.[16] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition. At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit.[17] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector, an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh.[18] E-motion cone[edit] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system.[19] In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs.[20] At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.[21][22] Temperature Red Warmer Green No change Blue Cooler Other <flashing> Precipitation Yellow Severe weather See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Carnegie Science Center.

As of the 2000 U.S. census, Chateau has a population of 39. A 2006 investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found the neighborhood virtually uninhabited.[4] This may be because the neighborhood mostly consists of warehouses and places of business along the Ohio River.

The Miniature Railroad & Village (MRRV) is a large and detailed model train layouts diorama of western Pennsylvania from 1880 to 1930. It is a long-running display currently located in the Kamin Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the MRRV has been a Pittsburgh tradition for over 50 years. History[edit] A model of the Bowdish Homestead, since demolished, on the MRRV platform. The exhibit was initiated by Charles Bowdish (1896–1988) of Brookville, Pennsylvania. Bowdish was a soldier during World War I. When doctors discovered a congenital heart problem, he was honorably discharged from service and sent home, where he began to build models of structures around Brookville, his hometown. Every Christmas, in his home on Creek Street (the house has since been demolished), the buildings were assembled in a display, complete with Lionel trains running through it. On Christmas Eve 1920, Charles hosted his brother's wedding and reception, and entertained the guests by running his train display. One of the guests, Alfred Truman, asked if he could bring some friends over to see it—word quickly spread, and nearly 600 people showed up. Because of this, Christmas Eve 1920 is considered to be the birth date of the exhibit. Bowdish soon began setting up and exhibiting his railroad yearly at Christmas time in his house. Each year there would be a different theme, such as White Christmas or Indian Summer. The railroad spanned the entire second floor, and no admission fee was ever charged. Thousands of people saw it over the years, some coming from other countries. A combination of a flood nearly destroying his stored models, and his insurance company refusing to cover the crowds anymore, forced Charles to begin searching for a new home for his work. He originally offered it to Brookville, but the town declined. Eventually he offered it to the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science in Pittsburgh (renamed Buhl Science Center in the 1970s). The Buhl offered him space, and the exhibit opened there on December 1, 1954, and ran until December 31. During the 31-day period, figures showed that 23,885 visitors viewed the layout. It was originally 14' X 14', and was called The Great Christmastown Railroad. It was renamed The Miniature Railroad & Village in 1957. The exhibit was an instant hit, and was and still is one of the major holiday attractions in Pittsburgh. The MRRV was in the basement, and the queue would at times extend out the front door and around the block, and the wait would be four hours long. Eventually the dates it was open would be the first weekend of November to the last weekend of February. It was then torn down and stored until the next year because the space had to be used for the annual science fair. On January 1, 1987, the Buhl officially became a part of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The Buhl staff had been wanting to expand the science center so they could bring in large travelling exhibits, and create more of their own. Joining the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh allowed them to have the resources to do it. Buhl closed on August 31, 1991, and Kamin Science Center opened on October 5, 1991. A whole new building allowed the museum to dedicate a room just to the MRRV. The new and expanded Miniature Railroad & Village opened in the Fall of 1992. Present[edit] The replica of the Sharon Steel Mill. The current platform is 83 feet (25 m) long by 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, 60% larger than the original. Five independent loops feature Lionel trains, and one Bowser trolley travels through the town; these lines operate continuously. The new display's philosophy was the historic and educational significance of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas; this permitted the display to be considered a large, animated history book. Scenes on the display depict how people worked, lived, and played during the years 1880–1930. These years cover part of the American Industrial Revolution, the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the Gilded Age (as Mark Twain called it), World War I, the Roaring 20s, and the beginning of the Great Depression. All of the models featured on the display are handcrafted by staff, both paid and volunteers, and replicate real structures from around Western Pennsylvania. The display boasts the largest steel mill ever replicated in O scale: the Sharon Steel Mill from Farrell, PA, which was constructed from the mill's actual blueprints. Expert advisors were contracted to make the new display as lifelike as possible. For example, a Harvard professor designed the lighting system to resemble the movement of the Sun and actual daylight. A sophisticated computer system controls the layout. Opto 22, a company which supplies NASA and Disney World with control modules, provided the system. Every year, two months before Thanksgiving, the display closes down for maintenance. During this shutdown period, new models are installed, and sometimes new animations are installed, which were constructed earlier in the year, for exhibition on the display. Occasionally old models are installed as well. Scenes on the display are updated, and the layout is given a careful and thorough cleaning. The exhibit reopens the day after Thanksgiving. Collectible Boxcars[edit] Since 1999, Lionel has issued collectable boxcars and a caboose as part of the commemorative MRRV series. Each year, the boxcar features a unique design, drawn up inhouse. These limited edition cars are only available through the Kamin Science Center's XPLOR Store. Additionally, Lionel produced a Sub car for the Kamin Science Center in 2002 as part of the LCCA Pittsburgh Convention.

Kamin Science Center,[2][needs update] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Chateau[3] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium. Overview[edit] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year.[1][4] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as \"the biggest screen in Pittsburgh\"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University’s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema),[5] SportsWorks, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine). Updates[edit] According to Nicholas Efran, \"The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years.\" However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are \"Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building\"[6] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations.[7] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs.[8] In June 2022, § Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame, such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars, Maria from Metropolis, as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the § SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid, the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center’s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage \"until the Science Center decides what to do with it\".[5][9] History[edit] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science, which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States, and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger.[10] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.[11] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center[12] Roboworld (until 2022)[edit] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022.[9] It was touted as \"the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition\", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring \"all things robotic\".[13] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid, the Robothespian, an interactive, animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort.[14] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2, C-3PO, Data, the T-800 Terminator, R.O.B., Maschinenmensch, Gort, Robby the Robot, Robot B-9, HAL 9000, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running. Highmark SportsWorks[edit] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate.[15] The main idea of SportsWorks is \"to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports.\"[15] SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC, ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark. It reopened in the Fall of 2009.[16] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition. At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit.[17] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector, an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh.[18] E-motion cone[edit] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri. It was installed in 2000 with a computerized lighting system.[19] In 2008 a storm damaged the cone, thus it underwent upgrades to its lighting system with an addition of energy-efficient bulbs.[20] At night, it is lit with different colors, signalling the weather forecast from WTAE-TV for the coming day.[21][22] Temperature Red Warmer Green No change Blue Cooler Other <flashing> Precipitation Yellow Severe weather See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Carnegie Science Center.

In contrast to typical natural history museums, it is focused on the collection and exposition of organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans by means including selective breeding or genetic engineering,[1] a phenomenon referred to as the postnatural. The Center is \"dedicated to the advancement of knowledge relating to the complex interplay between culture, nature, and biotechnology\", whose mission is \"to acquire, interpret, and provide access to a collection of living, preserved, and documented organisms of postnatural origin\".[1] Origins[edit] It was founded by Richard Pell, an associate professor of Electronic and Time-based Arts at Carnegie Mellon University.[2] Exhibits[edit] Displays have included GloFish (with fluorescence genes from sea coral), 'Biosteel' goats that grow spider silk proteins in their milk,[3] transgenic fruit flies and a Silkie chicken, bred through the continuation of a recessive gene for its fluffy, fur-like coat. Exhibits are narrated via wired telephone handset.[3][4] A range of formats are used including photography, taxidermy and dioramas, and living exhibits.[5] In addition, the Center has an extensive online archive detailing past and current exhibitions, specimens, archives, events and press releases. Details of past exhibitions include notably those of the Cold Coast Archive, a collection of artefacts and seeds from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault collected by researchers and artists Signe Lidén, Annesofie Norn, and Steve Rowell which was displayed at the Center in 2012;[6] Atomic Age Rodents, an archive of rodents from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History which had been used in some form or another in atomic testing in the early to mid-20th Century;[7] and PostNatural Nature, produced in collaboration with the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin documenting different instances of the postnatural in everyday organisms.[8] Traveling exhibitions for museums and galleries are also produced.[2] Locations displayed at include the Waag Society in Amsterdam and the Art Laboratory in Berlin.[9] Design[edit] The Center employs a delicate and purposeful aesthetic to the display of their exhibits. It also intentionally uses neutral language so as to invite visitors to go beyond a reactionary impulse to stigma-blighted words, and instead consider the specimens and ideas on a deeper level. \"The Center for Post Natural history does not offer a celebration of this technological harnessing of the immanence of life, nor is it a simple rejection. Instead it is a careful exploration of how lives might be lived together, asking what might be at stake for subjects, places, practices and politics\".[10] In addition, the Center also produces a range of other paraphernalia pertaining to their collections and other conceptions of the postnatural. These include books, T-shirts and postcards,[11] and 3D archival prints which can be purchased on site. Recent news[edit] In 2015, the Center was featured by National Geographic in their March 2015 The Age of Disbelief issue.[12] References[edit] ^ a b \"About\". Center for PostNatural History.

Garfield is bordered on the South by Bloomfield and Friendship (at Penn Avenue), on the West by the Allegheny Cemetery (at Mathilda Street), on the North by Stanton Heights (at Mossfield Street), and on the East by East Liberty (at Negley Avenue). Like many parts of Pittsburgh, Garfield is a fairly steep neighborhood, with north-south residential streets running at about a 20% incline from Penn Avenue at the bottom to Mossfield Street at the top. Garfield is divided into “the valley” and “the hilltop.” Garfield is part of District 9 on the Pittsburgh City Council, and is currently represented by Rev. Ricky Burgess. City Steps[edit] The Garfield neighborhood has 13 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Garfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and the Penn Avenue business corridor and provide an easy way to access the Fort Pitt Playground and neighborhood parklets.[2]The recently[when?] refurbished N Winebiddle Street city steps in Garfield. Photo by Laura Zurowski. History[edit] Like nearby Bloomfield and Friendship, the land comprising modern-day Garfield was acquired by Casper Taub from the local Delaware tribe. Taub sold it to his son-in-law, Joseph Conrad Winebiddle, in the late 18th century. About a hundred years later, Winebiddle's descendants broke the family estate into lots and sold them to new residents of an expanding City of Pittsburgh. The first owner of a lot in present-day Garfield bought his plot in 1881, on the day that U.S. President James Garfield was buried, so the neighborhood was named for the late President.[3] Garfield's earliest settlers were predominantly blue-collar Irish laborers and their families, who worked in the mills and foundries down along the Allegheny River, shopped in local stores on Penn Avenue, and built and lived in modest brick foursquare homes on the streets running up from Penn Avenue. The community, then almost exclusively Catholic, built St. Lawrence O'Toole Parish on Penn Avenue in 1897. From 1880 until about 1960, the neighborhood remained as it began: a solid, working-class area. Neighborhood activist Aggie Brose described Garfield in 1960 as a place where \"You sponsored each other's kids, you went to all the weddings and funerals, you never wanted for a baby-sitter, you never had to call a repairman, you didn't need for a social. When you put the kids to bed, the women went out on the stoops.\"[4] Things changed in the 1960s, when some Garfield residents began to leave the City for nearby suburbs in Shaler and Penn Hills.[citation needed] In response, the City's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) used eminent domain and attempted to change nearby East Liberty from an urban shopping area, then the third-busiest retail center in Pennsylvania, to a suburban one. The URA knocked down many small shops, accessible on foot or by bus, and thereby opened land for larger ones, accessible by car.[citation needed] At the same time, the City's housing authority built several massive public housing complexes on Garfield's borders: Garfield Heights, a 600+ unit complex high up on Fern Street, and the East Mall, a 20+ story tower straddling Penn Avenue at the entrance to East Liberty. These changes, designed to halt the slow trickle of Garfield residents to the suburbs, instead turned a trickle into a torrent. East Liberty lost most of its businesses, and the new housing projects, inhabited by poor African-Americans, unnerved Garfield residents. In 1969 the federal government gave the City funds to enforce housing codes in Garfield so that as old residents fled, their homes were not allowed to deteriorate. This move also backfired: long-time residents, told that homes built in 1900 (and often passed through families over the years) did not meet codes written in 1960, moved away rather than pay for upgrades.[4] Thus began a textbook case of white flight: in 1970, Garfield had a population of roughly 10,000 people, 80% of them white. In 2000, Garfield's population had been cut almost in half to 5,450 people, 83% of them black.[5] To halt what they perceived as the neighborhood's decline, in 1975 parishioners at St. Lawrence O'Toole founded the Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation (BGC), a Community Development Corporation that uses private and government funds and activism to encourage home ownership and business development.[citation needed] Over the years, the organization has built or renovated dozens of housing units, and renovated commercial properties for dozens of small businesses, from restaurants to art galleries to theater companies. In the 1980s, a similar group called the Garfield Jubilee Association formed, with a goal of creating affordable housing.[citation needed] In recent years,[when?] the two groups have joined together in a joint project to build dozens of new single-family homes. In 2000, the BGC and Friendship Development Associates, Inc. formed the Penn Avenue Arts Initiative. The PAAI encourages artists to live and work along the Avenue by rehabbing properties, making small loans or grants for facade renovations, and organizing joint marketing events such as Unblurred, held the first Friday of each month, where the venues of Garfield and Friendship open for special events.[citation needed] Efforts by groups like these, along with a recent recognition that massive, 1960s-style social welfare projects often had negative consequences, have helped to revitalize the neighborhood.[citation needed] Commercially, Penn Avenue is recovering from the flight of local businesses in the 1970s and 1980s. Some bastions of the old neighborhood remain, as groups like the BGC and GJA, and FDA have worked to keep some banks and stores along Penn Avenue. Since 1990, these have been joined by newcomers: African-American barbershops and salons, tiny family-owned Vietnamese restaurants, and a series of arts-related businesses (e.g., theatres, galleries, an architecture studio, a glass factory, a coffeeshop, and much more) attracted by the PAAI.[citation needed] There has also been some positive residential development: the East Mall and Garfield Heights Senior highrise was razed in 2005, and the townhouse units are scheduled to be demolished in 2007–2008, and replaced with mixed-income units, as well as new replacement homes scattered through the neighborhood.[6] Visitors to Garfield today will see a neighborhood on the rise, a formerly blighted community that is now becoming a vibrant community, with a focus on the arts, while not forgetting its roots ([1]).

It is in the Allegheny Center neighborhood in Pittsburgh's Northside. History[edit] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh was founded in 1983 in the old Allegheny Post Office, gifted to the museum by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, and is situated on Pittsburgh's North Side, formerly Allegheny City. The neighboring Buhl Planetarium building was vacated by 1991 when it was superseded by the nearby Kamin Science Center. The museum grew from a traveling mobile museum started at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1972, and was part of the first wave of children's museums spreading across the country at that time.[3] New building[edit] In the early 2000s, it was announced the museum would be expanding from the old Beaux Arts-style post office into the neighboring vacant Art Deco Buhl Planetarium. A plan was devised by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc. to connect the two historic structures with a modern glass addition over what was a street called Allegheny Square. The street was vacated and realigned and the addition was built. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh became the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country in March 2006. This validates that the museum's expansion has been designed and constructed using sustainable practices with particular attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, indoor air quality as well as developing new programs for visitors. To offer teaching moments about the new green museum, many of the building's structural and mechanical systems are left exposed. Buhl Community Park[edit] In 2010, officials announced plans to rehab a rundown park in front of the museum. The centerpiece of the new park will be a fog sculpture by Ned Kahn. The park opened on June 23, 2012, during a community celebration.[4][5] Grounds[edit] In its seasonal \"Backyard\",[6] the museum grounds includes an interactive environment called \"Allegheny Waterworks\" which incorporates preserved local architectural relics.[7] A garden on the grounds once displayed sculptures of Guyasuta, Christopher Gist and others, designed by sculptor Charles Keck and rescued from the Manchester Bridge when it was razed in 1970. The garden was removed in the 2000s to make room for more parking. The Guyasuta and Gist sculptures have been reinstalled near Stage AE in the North Shore neighborhood.[8] Exhibits[edit] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh houses several ongoing exhibits as well as rotating exhibits. The MAKESHOP, Kindness Gallery, Studio, Backyard, Garage, Garden, Theater, Waterplay, and Nursery areas are ongoing interactive exhibits and encourage touch and play.[9] Also located within the museum are iconic items from the show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. These include the original puppets, one of Fred Rogers' sweaters, and his sneakers.[10] Programs[edit] The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh presents a wide variety of programs for children in fields ranging from dance and rocket building to quilting and robotics. Visiting artists offer workshops in a host of media, including pottery, Japanese paper cutting, animation and painting. The museum's extensive outreach program offers performances, workshops, after school programs, artist days and festival programs for schools and groups throughout the year. Educational field trips are offered for local schools, scouts and other groups. The museum has collaborated with a number of regional institutions and programs, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Create a Comic Project.[11][12] Awards[edit] The former Buhl Planetarium building is now part of the Children's Museum The addition has received numerous awards, including a 2009 National Medal for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, National Trust for Historic Preservation award, LEED silver certification, and an award from American Institute of Architects. Children's Museum Executive Director Jane Werner received the Green Building Alliance[13] 2006 Shades of Green Leadership Award which celebrates leaders who have helped transform the Pittsburgh region into a more sustainable place to live and work. Werner's contributions cited include launching a new program/initiative supporting green-building related activities; raising significant community awareness and outreach of green issues through materials, programs and events; and influencing the adoption of a program/policy through advocacy efforts and implementing green management and operation policies within the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.

Its zip code is 15212, and it has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by both council members for District 6 (Downtown, North Shore) and District 1 (Northside). History[edit] In 1783, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established a 3000-acre tract of land north of where the Allegheny River merged with the Ohio River.[3] John Redick created an initial town plan for Allegheny City- which featured 36 city blocks surrounded by a common grazing area - the following year.[4] That initial 36-block area is today's Allegheny Center. It is still surrounded on three sides by the former grazing area, now a public park called Allegheny Commons. On either side of this park are the neighborhoods of Allegheny West and East Allegheny. Because Allegheny City was intended by the Pennsylvania Legislature to serve as the county seat of Allegheny County, the central blocks of Redick's 36-block plan were designed for public uses, including a market house and post office. The main thoroughfare was East Ohio Street, which stretched from Allegheny West through Allegheny Center and then to Allegheny East and beyond. From the 19th century to 1907, Allegheny Center was thus the hub of downtown Allegheny City. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh (consisting of the old Allegheny Post Office and Buhl Planetarium joined by a 2006 addition) is located within it, as is the old Carnegie Free Library of Allegheny (now the New Hazlett Theater and the Children's MuseumLab). Allegheny Center is also home to the National Aviary, situated within West Park. After 1907 (when Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City), this area continued to be a hub for those residents of what was now Pittsburgh's North Side. But the area deteriorated as: 1) Allegheny's wealthiest residents, who had founded Allegheny Country Club in 1895, moved the club to Sewickley in 1902 and began moving their residences along with it; 2) the Great Depression caused an economic slowdown; and 3) rationing during World War II prevented much investment in the buildings. As one example of the trend, the landmark Boggs & Buhl department store, which had done a thriving business among Allegheny City's wealthy residents, steadily lost money after 1931 and was closed in 1958.[5] In the 1950s, community leaders discussed how to revitalize the historic hub of Allegheny City and established a modern plan for Allegheny Center. Designed by architects Deeter & Ritchey, it involved a $65 million project by Alcoa Properties, Inc. The construction project razed about 518 buildings (including the Boggs & Buhl department store) - many of them taken by eminent domain - to make way for 2 professional buildings, 4 apartment complexes totaling 840 units, 50 townhouses, a shopping mall, and a 3-acre (12,000 m2) public square. The public square was the object of an international design competition sponsored by the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority. The entire Allegheny Redevelopment Area encompasses approximately 79 acres (320,000 m2) on the North Side, about a half-mile from downtown Pittsburgh. The project converted what had been an open, walkable business district into an enclosed mall called Allegheny Center Mall that had few pedestrian entrances and sat above an underground parking garage. The central portion of East Ohio Street was closed, and drivers were forced to take a new ring road around the mall and the other blocks of Redick's initial plan to proceed east or west. The former Allegheny Center Mall from PNC Park in 2014. The mall, opened in 1965 and anchored by Sears, F. W. Woolworth Company, and Zayre, had some initial success, but it did not revive the business fortunes of Allegheny City, which continued to decline after Interstate 279 allowed area residents to drive to the northern suburbs to shop.[6][7] The mall's stores began closing in the 1990s, and the mall gradually became a successful office complex.[8] Today,[when?] the 36-block area initially planned by John Redick consists of the Allegheny Center Mall - now Nova Place, which contains 1.5 million square feet of Class A office space in the old mall concourse, plus two of the office towers, restaurants, including Federal Galley, a fitness center, and Alloy 26, Pittsburgh's largest coworking space, which is located in the concourse[9] - and several public structures including the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. A former business district along North Avenue in Central Northside, which deteriorated along with Allegheny Center, is also being revived.

It was created and hosted by Fred Rogers. Its original incarnation, the series Misterogers debuted in Canada on October 15, 1962, on CBC Television.[4] In 1966, Rogers moved back to the United States creating Misterogers' Neighborhood (sometimes shown as MisteRogers' Neighborhood), later called Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, on the regional Eastern Educational Television Network (EETN, a forerunner of today's American Public Television). The U.S. national debut of the show occurred on February 19, 1968. It aired on NET and its successor, PBS, until August 31, 2001. The series is aimed primarily at preschool children ages 2 to 5, but it was labeled by PBS as \"appropriate for all ages\".[5] Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was produced by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public broadcaster WQED and Rogers' non-profit production company Family Communications, Inc., previously known as Small World Enterprises prior to 1971; the company was renamed The Fred Rogers Company after Rogers' death (it has since been renamed again to Fred Rogers Productions as of 2019).[6][7] In May 1997, the series surpassed Captain Kangaroo as the longest-running children's television series,[8][2] a record the series held until June 2003, when Sesame Street beat Mister Rogers' record. The series could be seen in reruns on most PBS stations until August 31, 2007,[9] when it began to be removed by various PBS stations, and was then permanently removed from the daily syndicated schedule by PBS after August 29, 2008. Eleven years after Mister Rogers' Neighborhood concluded, PBS debuted an animated spin-off, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. A 50th-anniversary tribute and a PBS pledge-drive show, hosted by actor Michael Keaton (who got his start on the show), titled Mister Rogers: It's You I Like, premiered on PBS stations nationwide on March 6, 2018.[10] In December 2023, Variety ranked Mister Rogers' Neighborhood #89 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.[11] History Neighborhood Trolley from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood set at WQED studios in Pittsburgh. The series had its genesis in 1953, when Rogers and Josie Carey joined the newly formed public television station WQED. On April 5, 1954, WQED debuted The Children's Corner, a program featuring Rogers as puppeteer and composer, with Carey as host and lyricist, in an unscripted weekday-afternoon live television program.[12] It was on this program where many of the puppets, characters and music used in the later series were developed, such as King Friday XIII, Daniel Tiger, and X the Owl. It was also the time when Rogers began wearing his famous sneakers, as he found them to be quieter than his work shoes while he was moving about behind the set. The show was briefly broadcast nationally on the NBC Television Network.[13][14][15] CBC television Rogers moved to Toronto, Ontario, in 1961 to work on a new series based on The Children's Corner, called Misterogers, a 15-minute program on CBC Television.[16] Misterogers aired on CBC for about four years, and a number of the set pieces that he would take with him back to the United States, such as the trolley and castle, were created for the Canadian program by CBC designers and in collaboration with producer Bruce Attridge. Most importantly, Rogers appeared on camera in the new show rather than only appearing through puppets or characters. Fred Rainsberry, head of Children's Programming at CBC, persuaded Rogers to appear on camera in the new show (which he named after Rogers) after seeing him interact with children.[17] Ernie Coombs, one of the Americans whom Rogers brought with him to help develop the CBC show, would remain with CBC, on Rogers' recommendation, after Rogers returned to the United States. Coombs first appeared as Mr. Dressup in the CBC program Butternut Square, conceived and produced by Attridge. Coombs then helped to develop what became Mr. Dressup, which ran for nearly 30 years as an iconic presence on Canadian television, ending in 1996.[18] Move to WQED In 1966, Rogers acquired the rights to his program from CBC and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on The Children's Corner. He renamed the show Misterogers' Neighborhood, which initially aired regionally in the northeastern United States through EEN, including educational stations in Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City.[18] The 100 episodes of the half-hour show incorporated the \"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\" segments from the CBC episodes with additional reality-based opening and closing material produced in Pittsburgh. The series was cancelled in 1967 due to lack of funding, but an outpouring of public response prompted a search for new funding. In 1967, The Sears Roebuck Foundation provided funding for the program, which enabled it to be seen nationwide on National Educational Television; taping began on September 21, 1967[19][20][21] for the first national season. The first national broadcast of Misterogers' Neighborhood appeared on most NET stations on February 19, 1968. In 1970, when PBS replaced NET, it also inherited this program. Around the same time, the show had a slight title change, to the more-familiar Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The show was broadcast from February 19, 1968 to February 20, 1976, and again from August 27, 1979 to August 31, 2001. The final episode was recorded on December 1, 2000.[22] The studio at WQED in Pittsburgh in which the series was recorded was later renamed \"The Fred Rogers Studio\". Format Rogers on the set in the late 1960s Rogers and François Clemmons having a foot bath in 1969, breaking a well known color barrier[23] Rogers changing shoes Rogers and wife Joanne Rogers, 1975 During each half-hour segment, Rogers spoke directly to the viewer about various topics, taking the viewer on tours of factories, demonstrating experiments, crafts, and music, and interacting with his friends. Rogers also made a point simply to behave naturally on camera rather than acting out a character, stating that \"One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away\".[2] The half-hour episodes were punctuated by a puppet segment chronicling occurrences in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Another segment of the show consisted of Rogers going to different places around the neighborhood, where he interviewed people to talk about their work and other contributions that focused on the episode's theme, such as Brockett's Bakery, Bob Trow's Workshop, and Negri's Music Shop. In one episode, Rogers took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of The Incredible Hulk, which aired on CBS from 1978 to 1982. At the start of each episode, the show's logo appears as the camera pans slowly over a model of the neighborhood, as the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers' television house. From 1979 to 1981, an alternate version of the opening sequence was used.[which?] Beginning in the early 1980s, the neighborhood model incorporated a small version of the \"Neighborhood Trolley\", as it crosses several streets from left to right on a model train track. This is the same model electric trolley that later in the program would transport viewers into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.[24] Usually, the camera goes from the neighborhood to out on the porch of the Rogers' television house, where the viewers see Fred Rogers coming for a visit before he enters the house. After the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers' television house, Fred Rogers is seen coming home with his jacket on, singing \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\". He goes into the closet, takes off his jacket, hangs it up, and grabs a cardigan zipper sweater to put on. After that, he takes his dress shoes off and grabs a pair of blue sneakers to put on. One of Rogers' sweaters now hangs in the Smithsonian Institution, a testament to the cultural influence of his simple daily ritual.[25] At the end of each episode, Rogers sang \"It's Such a Good Feeling\" (a different song, \"Tomorrow\" was used from 1968 to 1972) when he took off his sneakers as he says \"You're alive\" in a higher-toned voice, and grabs his dress shoes to put back on, and then snaps his fingers two times. After that, Rogers goes into the closet, takes off his cardigan, hangs it up, and grabs his jacket to put back on. Before the closing credits, Rogers got ready to go out the door by reminding the viewers: \"You always make each day a special day. You know how: By just your being you/yourself. There's only one person in the whole world that's like you, and that's you. And people can like you just/exactly the way you are. I'll be back next time. Bye-bye!\". During the closing credits, which is complete with the show's logo and the episode number, the camera would perform a reversed version of the opening sequence's pan shot, while the \"Neighborhood Trolley\" crosses streets from right to left. Starting in 1979, episodes were grouped into week-long series, with each series focused on a particular topic; each opening includes that week's subject, in the form of \"Mister Rogers Talks About [subject]\". Rogers' monologues throughout the week explore various facets of the topic, and the ongoing story from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe serves as illustration. Rogers covered a broad range of topics over the years, and the series did not shy away from issues that other children's programming avoided. In fact, Rogers endeared himself to many when, on March 23, 1970, he dealt with the death of one of his pet goldfish. The series also dealt with competition, divorce, and war. Rogers returned to the topic of anger regularly and focused on peaceful ways of dealing with angry feelings. Beginning in the third season, Mister Rogers always made a clear distinction between the realistic world of his television neighborhood and the fantasy world of Make-Believe (prior to that, the line was blurred somewhat as he would often talk about it as if it were real and he had a direct line of contact with the characters in it). He often discussed what was going to happen in Make-Believe before the next fantasy segment was shown (\"Let's pretend that Prince Tuesday has been having scary dreams...\"), and sometimes acted out bits of Make-Believe with models on a table before the camera transitioned to the live-action puppet rendition. The miniature motorized trolley, which was known in character form as \"Trolley\", with its accompanying fast-paced piano theme music, and which was operated by Rogers with his left hand, working buttons and controls hidden on the side of the bench on which Rogers usually would sit, was the only element that appeared regularly in both the realistic world and Make-Believe: it was used to transport viewers from one realm to the other. Rogers, however, was mentioned from time to time in Make-Believe, particularly by Mr. McFeely, who appeared occasionally in the Make-Believe segments and seemed to form a link between the two worlds. The idea of the trolley came from Rogers. When he was young, many trolleys operated in Pittsburgh, and he liked riding on them.[26] This reality/fantasy distinction put Rogers' series in sharp contrast with other children's series, such as Sesame Street and Captain Kangaroo, which freely mixed realistic and fantastic elements. Trolley was a character in its own right. Often, when it crossed into the Neighborhood of Make Believe, it would stop and have a \"conversation\" with King Friday XIII (by moving back and forth slightly and making bell noises to respond to Friday), then continue on. Trolley also truly showed the difference between the worlds during the week when the three youngest puppet characters (Daniel Striped Tiger, Prince Tuesday, and Ana Platypus) prepared for and went to school for the first time, as it played the school bus. When in Mister Rogers' house, it simply had two pieces of yellow construction paper shaped and drawn like the profile of a school bus stuck to its sides, but in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, it had a chassis on it that made it look like a school bus. The series featured \"Picture Picture\", a rear-projection motion picture and slide projector, whose screen was encased with a picture frame. In early episodes, Picture Picture would show various films or slides at Mister Rogers' command; after the material was presented, Mister Rogers would thank Picture Picture, to which it would return a \"You're Welcome\" on its screen. After 1970, Picture Picture no longer operated magically, becoming merely a projector; Mister Rogers would insert a film, slides or videotape through a slot on the side, then show the material using a wired remote control (slides were viewed on Picture Picture; films and video were faded in to the clip). When Picture Picture was not used, a different painting would be displayed on its screen. Often it would display the words \"Hello\" or \"Hi\" at the opening. The series was also notable for its use of jazz-inspired music, mostly arranged and performed by Johnny Costa, until Costa's death in 1996, when he was succeeded by Michael Moricz for the remainder of the series. The music was unique in its simplicity and flow that blended with the series' sketches and features. The music was usually played live during taping. Lyrics and melodies were written and sung by Rogers, who created more than 200 original songs.

Neighborhood of Make-Believe Main article: Neighborhood of Make-Believe The \"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\" is the fictional kingdom visited by Mr. Rogers during the show. Characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were portrayed by both hand puppets and actors. Fred Rogers was the puppeteer for a great number of the characters: Collette Cornflake S. Pecially Daniel Striped Tiger Donkey Hodie Edgar Cooke Grandpere Tiger Henrietta Pussycat Ino A. Horse King Friday XIII Lady Elaine Fairchilde Mrs. Frogg Princess Margeret H. Lizard Queen Sara Saturday Tadpole Frogg X the Owl Other characters and their performers or puppeteers: Anna Platypus Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones Bob Dog Cousin Mary Owl Cousin Steven Owl Dr. Duckbill Platypus Elsie Jean Platypus Harriett Elizabeth Cow H.J. Elephant III Hula Mouse James Michael Jones Prince Tuesday Purple Panda Robert Troll In addition to Bob Trow, other regular puppeteers included Michael Horton, Lenny Meledandri (1980–2001), and Carole Switala. Michael Keaton made his first television appearance as a volunteer in 1975. He played an acrobat in a troupe called The Flying Zookeenies that performed for King Friday's birthday and was also in charge of running the Trolley.[29] Operas Thirteen in-series \"operas\" took place during the course of the series within the Make-Believe segments.[27] Many of them featured American baritone John Reardon as a main character. The operas would encompass the entire episode and would be seen after a brief introduction by Mr. Rogers. Babysitter Opera (1968) Campsite Opera (1968) Teddy Bear/Whaling Ship Opera (1969) \"Pineapples and Tomatoes\" (1970) \"Monkey's Uncle\" (1971) \"Snow People and Warm Pussycat\" (1972) \"Potato Bugs and Cows\" (1973) \"All in the Laundry\" (1974) \"Key to Otherland\" (1975) \"Windstorm in Bubbleland\" (1980) \"Spoon Mountain\" (1982) \"A Granddad for Daniel\" (1984) \"A Star for Kitty\" (1986) Additionally, a play, Josephine The Short-Necked Giraffe, first aired in 1989 as a tribute to the late John Reardon. Guests Guests on the series ranged from cellist Yo-Yo Ma to actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno of TV's The Incredible Hulk (in a 2001 piece where celebrities were asked about their heroes, Rogers cited Ma as one of his heroes[citation needed]). A 1968 visit by electronic music pioneer Bruce Haack resurfaced in the 2004 documentary Haack: King of Techno. Guests on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood were often surprised to find that, although Rogers was just as gentle and patient in life as on television, he was nevertheless a perfectionist who did not allow \"shoddy\" ad-libbing;[30] he believed that children were thoughtful people who deserved programming as good as anything produced for adults on television.[31] Rogers appeared as a guest on some other series. On the children's animated cartoon series Arthur, for example, Rogers plays himself as an aardvark like Arthur. Later on, Arthur appears as a guest in hand-puppet form in a 1999 episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Bill Nye, host of a science-themed program, and Rogers also exchanged appearances on each other's series, as did Rogers and Captain Kangaroo. Rogers additionally appeared in an episode of Sesame Street, where he explains to Big Bird that, even if one loses a running race such as the one Big Bird had run against his friend \"Snuffy\", no hard feelings threaten to break the two of them apart.[32] Big Bird himself also appeared in one episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, when he came to deliver his entry to the \"Draw the Neighborhood\" art contest.

(September 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Rogers testifies before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications on May 1, 1969, explaining how his series was funded and convincing senators to further fund PBS's predecessor NET. N.E.T. affiliated stations children's program fund (1968–1970) The Sears-Roebuck Foundation (1968–1976, 1979–1992) Corporation for Public Broadcasting (1971–1976, 1991–2001) Office of Education (1974–1975) Bureau of Education for the Handicapped (1975) Ford Foundation (1975–1976) Johnson & Johnson (1975–1976) Public Television Stations / \"contributions to your PBS station from Viewers Like You\" (1975–1976, 1979–2001) The Ford Foundation, Public Television Stations and Johnson & Johnson also provided funding for repeats of the 1969-1975 color episodes, beginning in 1976. After the series When Fred Rogers died in 2003, PBS's website provided suggestions to parents on how to respond to children who ask about Rogers' death.[33] Beginning on September 3, 2007, some PBS affiliates began replacing the show with new programs such as Super Why!, WordGirl and WordWorld. In June 2008, PBS announced that, beginning in late 2008, the network would stop broadcasting Mister Rogers' Neighborhood as part of its daily syndication lineup to member stations, instead airing the program only once a week over the weekend.[34] Milwaukee PBS, for example, still carries the show once a week, on Sunday, over its primary HD/SD channel.[35] Beginning on September 1, 2008, Mister Rogers was replaced by new programming such as Martha Speaks, Sid the Science Kid, and an update of The Electric Company. However, individual member stations have the option of airing Mister Rogers independently of the PBS syndicated feed, with series home WQED in particular continuing to air the series daily until 2010.[36] There was a campaign in 2008 and 2009 to urge PBS and all member stations to bring the show back seven days a week.[37] The premiere of the Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood spin-off in 2012 effectively ended most reruns of the show for several years, but, by 2017, some stations began to bring back a select number of episodes. As of 2023, reruns air on many PBS stations early in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series' national premiere, PBS aired select episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for a week in February 2018. Spin-offs Main articles: Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood and Donkey Hodie (TV series) In July 2011, during the annual Television Critics Association summer press tour, it was announced that a new animated spin-off series, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, was in production. The show debuted on most PBS stations on September 3, 2012. The series features Daniel Tiger, the four-year-old son of Daniel Striped Tiger, as a host of the series, which also features characters of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe all grown older, with the children now having families of their own.[7][38] A second spin-off titled Donkey Hodie, focusing on the titular character, aired on PBS May 3, 2021. The puppet series features a radically different design for the character along with his friends Purple Panda, Duck Duck and Bob Dog, as they learn and sing through the land of \"Someplace Else\".[39][40] Music and regular songs Regular songs \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" redirects here. For the film, see Won't You Be My Neighbor? (film). The song \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" was written by Fred Rogers in 1967 and was used as the opening theme for each episode of the show. In the first three seasons of the show, during which new episodes were constantly being produced, each show ended with the song \"Tomorrow\", which was written by Rogers' former colleague, Josie Carey. Starting with Season 4 in 1971,[citation needed] \"Tomorrow\" was used only on Monday through Thursday episodes, and a new closing song, which is titled as \"The Weekend Song\", was used only on Friday episodes as the program would not return until Monday. Eventually, the \"Tomorrow\" song was removed entirely due to copyright issues, and by 1973, Rogers sang \"It's Such a Good Feeling\" at the end of each episode. Prior to 1973, the original version of \"It's Such a Good Feeling\" was used as part of Mister Rogers' general repertoire of songs. When \"It's Such a Good Feeling\" became the closing theme for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1973, it used a rewrite of \"The Weekend Song\" at the end, using only the first four lines: \"And I'll be back when the day is new, and I'll have more ideas for you. And you'll have things you'll want to talk about; I will too\". This was only used on Monday through Thursday episodes. On Friday episodes, the lyric was changed to \"week\" instead of \"day\". On early episodes of this season, the line was originally written as \"When tomorrow is new\". Music Musical directors for the series include: Johnny Costa (1968–96) Michael Moricz, who took over as music director after Costa's death and served until the end of the series in 2001. In addition to arranging and directing the music heard on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Costa, along with other musicians, performed almost all the background music heard on the series, including the show's recognizable main theme, the trolley whistle, Mr. McFeeley's frenetic speedy delivery piano plonks, the vibraphone flute-toots (played on a synthesizer) as Fred fed his fish, dreamy celesta lines, incidental music, and Rogers' entrance and exit tunes. Each day an episode was recorded, Costa and his ensemble played live in the studio for the filming. Musicians who played in this ensemble were: Johnny Costa – Piano, Celesta, Synthesizer, & Trolley Whistle Joe Negri – Guitar Carl McVicker Jr. – Bass Guitar, Double Bass Bobby Rawsthorne – Drums & Percussion[41][42] Even after Costa's death in 1996, much of the music heard on the program continued to be Costa's, and his name continued to be listed in the show's closing credits as one of its Musical Directors.[43] Broadcast history The first broadcast of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was on the National Educational Television network on February 19, 1968; the color NET logo appeared on a model building at the beginning and end of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1969 to 1970. When NET ceased operations, the series moved its successor network PBS, even though episodes up until the end of the fourth season in May 1971 were still copyrighted by and produced for NET.[44] The series' first season (1968) consisted of 130 episodes, produced in black-and-white. For seasons 2–8 (1969–75), the show produced 65 new color episodes each year. By the end of season 8, this meant there was a library of 455 color episodes that could be repeated indefinitely. Rogers and the rest of the show's cast and crew began suffering burnout from taping 65 episodes a year and, in 1975, Rogers made the decision to take a break from the series for a few years. As a consequence, season 9 (1976) consisted of only five episodes. These five new episodes (which aired the final week of original episodes of the so-called \"first series\") featured Mister Rogers in his workshop, watching scenes of past episodes of his series, which he recorded on videocassettes and kept on the shelf in his workshop. On the Friday episode of that week (February 20, 1976), he reminded viewers that they, too, could watch many of those old episodes beginning the following week. During the hiatus period, two primetime episodes were produced and aired as specials: a Christmas show in December 1977 and a \"springtime\"-themed show. In 1978, production of the series resumed, with an eye towards \"freshening up\" the show by producing 15 new episodes per year. These \"second series\" episodes, which began airing in August 1979, would be mixed in with the already-airing cycle of repeats from the so-called \"first series\" (i.e., the color episodes of seasons 2–9, aired from 1969 to 1976). The series aired 15 new episodes annually between 1979 and 1993. As well, there were occasional \"Mister Rogers Talks with Parents About...\" specials, which featured panelists discussing ways in which parents could talk to their children about the issues discussed on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. These specials usually were aired on weekends, just prior to the airing of a new batch of Monday-to-Friday episodes. Beginning in 1994, the production schedule was changed so that 10 new episodes a year were produced instead of 15. Shortly thereafter, as of August 11, 1995,[citation needed] the episodes from the \"first series\" (1968–76) were withdrawn from the repeat schedule, since there were over 200 \"second series\" episodes available for broadcast, and many of the first series episodes had become outdated.[citation needed] The show's final years varied the number of episodes produced per season: season 26 (1995–96) consisted of 20 episodes, season 27 (1997) produced 10 episodes, seasons 28 and 29 (1998–99) both contained 15 episodes, and season 30 (2000) reverted to 10 episodes. The final season, season 31 (2001), consisted of only 5 episodes, centering on the theme \"Celebrate The Arts\". A few episodes from the \"first series\" are available for viewing in the Paley Center for Media, including the first episode of the series and the first color episode. A complete collection of episodes, including more than 900 videotapes and scripts from the show along with other promotional materials produced by Rogers or his Family Communications Inc. production company, exists in the Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Archives, located in the Elizabeth Nesbitt Room at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information Building.[45] Reruns When PBS began re-airing the first 460 color episodes of the series in 1976, some of the earliest color episodes from 1969 and 1970 were re-edited with new voice-overs or footage. For example, in one 1970 episode where Mister Rogers demonstrates the noise-proof ear protectors that airport workers use on the tarmac, the film footage used featured a worker directing a United Airlines jet with its stylized \"U\" logo—which was not introduced until 1974. All of the episodes revised from the first series also included an extra segment following the closing credits, mentioning the episode number and additional companies that provided funding since these episodes originally aired, even though they had not provided funding at the time of their original production. The episode numbers correlated to activity guides for parents, which included activities and discussion topics for parents and child care providers to utilize with their children.[46] The black and white episodes of the first season were last re-run on August 21, 1970, just before NET was replaced by PBS. As of 2013[update], almost all of the 1979–2001 \"second series\" episodes are still in active rotation on a number of PBS stations.[47][48][49] The only exception is the week-long \"Conflict\" series (episodes #1521–#1525), first aired during the week of November 7–11, 1983. The series/story arc covered the topics of war, bombs, and an arms race, and was created in response to the Invasion of Grenada, and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.[citation needed] The \"Conflict\" series was last aired on PBS during the week of April 1–5, 1996.[citation needed] Only a few episodes of the series have been released to DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, although some earlier compilation-based releases were issued on VHS by Playhouse Video during the mid-1980s. 100 episodes have subsequently been released as part of Amazon Video.[50] A DVD set titled the It's a Beautiful Day Collection, containing 30 episodes from the second series, was released on March 27, 2018 by PBS.[51][52] Twitch marathons On May 11, 2017, streaming video platform Twitch announced with The Fred Rogers Company that 886 episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood would be streamed live on the Internet over an 18-day period (although several episodes were skipped over during the marathon, most notably the 1983 \"Conflict\" episodes).[53] The marathon began on May 15, 2017, at noon PT and ended on June 3, 2017. The marathon included many Mister Rogers episodes that had only aired once before. During the live stream, viewers were encouraged to support their local PBS station.[53] Mister Rogers' Neighborhood joined other popular PBS shows, including The Joy of Painting and The French Chef, that have been streamed on the Twitch service.[53] On March 20, 2018, Twitch began streaming a 90-episode marathon to commemorate Rogers' 90th birthday, followed by a repeat marathon of the series.[54][55] International Broadcast In the Canadian province of Ontario, the show was broadcast on TVOntario from 1970 to 1989. These broadcasts could also be seen in U.S. cities close to Canadian border. Digital Platforms In late May 2024, it was announced that online streaming platform Pluto TV would be creating a dedicated 24/7 channel for Mister Rogers Neighborhood as the program was available already on-demand.[56][57] On June 10th, the channel was launched.[58] The show is also among the shows broadcast by the free streaming channel PBS Retro launched in April 2024.[59] Episodes SeasonEpisodesOriginally releasedFirst releasedLast releasedNetwork1130February 19, 1968August 16, 1968NET265February 10, 1969May 9, 1969365February 2, 1970May 1, 1970465February 15, 1971May 14, 1971PBS565February 21, 1972May 19, 1972665February 19, 1973May 18, 1973765February 18, 1974May 17, 1974865February 17, 1975May 16, 197595February 16, 1976February 20, 19761015August 27, 1979May 23, 19801115February 16, 1981July 24, 19811215March 1, 1982July 2, 19821315November 15, 1982April 29, 19831415November 7, 1983May 11, 19841515November 19, 1984May 17, 19851615November 25, 1985May 9, 19861715November 24, 1986May 8, 19871815November 23, 1987May 6, 19881915November 21, 1988May 5, 19892015November 20, 1989August 3, 19902115November 19, 1990August 30, 19912215November 25, 1991August 28, 19922315November 23, 1992September 3, 19932410February 21, 1994September 2, 19942510February 20, 1995September 1, 19952620October 16, 1995August 30, 19962710February 17, 1997August 29, 19972815February 16, 1998August 28, 19982915February 15, 1999August 27, 19993010February 21, 2000September 1, 2000315August 27, 2001August 31, 2001Specials17June 7, 1968September 13, 1994NET (special 1), PBS (specials 2–17) Specials A prime time Christmas special, Christmastime with Mister Rogers, first aired in 1977. This special had François Clemmons introducing a storyteller and flutist friend to Rogers. They filmed several narrated segments of the stories François' friend told. The special also had the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segment which shows how they celebrated Christmas. The trolley had a banner on the roof that said \"Merry Christmas\" on one side, and \"Happy Hannukah\" on the other. This special was aired every Christmas season until 1982. This special's opening has Rogers walking through a real neighborhood while the titles roll rather than the model neighborhood used in the series. In 1994, Rogers created another one-time special for PBS called Fred Rogers' Heroes which consisted of documentary portraits of four real-life people whose work helped make their communities better. Rogers, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit and tie, hosted in wraparound segments that did not use the \"Neighborhood\" set. For a time, Rogers produced specials for the parents as a precursor to the subject of the week on the Neighborhood called \"Mister Rogers Talks To Parents About [topic]\". Rogers did not host those specials, though; other people like Joan Lunden, who hosted the \"Conflict\" special, and other news announcers played MC duties in front of a gallery of parents while Rogers answered questions from them. These specials were made to prepare the parents for any questions the children might ask after watching the episodes on that topic of the week. Mister Rogers: It's You I Like On March 6, 2018, a primetime special commemorating the 50th anniversary of the series aired on PBS, hosted by actor Michael Keaton.[10][60] The hour-long special also features interviews by musician Yo-Yo Ma, musician Itzhak Perlman, actress Sarah Silverman, actress Whoopi Goldberg, actor John Lithgow, screenwriter Judd Apatow, actor David Newell, producer Ellen Doherty, and spouse Joanne Byrd Rogers, as well as clips of memorable moments from the show, such as Rogers visiting Koko the gorilla, Margaret Hamilton dressing up as The Wizard of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West, and Jeff Erlanger in his wheelchair singing \"It's You I Like\" with Rogers.[61] Earlier PBS specials include Our Neighbor, Fred Rogers in 1990 and Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor in 2003.[62][63][64] A short special, Mister Rogers in Our Neighborhood by PBS station WUCF, described Fred Rogers's college years and family connections in Florida.[65] Tributes Over the years, many television shows, exhibits and attractions have been named in tribute to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. After three years as a traveling exhibit, the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh[26] had \"Welcome to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" installed as a permanent exhibit in 2004.[66] The planetarium show \"The Sky Above Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" is an animated adaptation of the television show for preschool-aged children.[67] Idlewild and Soak Zone, an amusement park near Rogers' hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania has an attraction called \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe\" featuring a life-size trolley ride, designed by Rogers. This was shut down in 2014 to reopen as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood in 2015.[68][69] A children's play area at Monroeville Mall in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monroeville was named for the television show.[70] Many of the artifacts from the set of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, including the tree of X the owl, the make-believe neighborhood and the inside entrance to Mister Rogers' home is on display at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. Also included is a life-size figure of Mister Rogers and a sweater he wore on the show. A kiosk containing artifacts used during the series is located on Concourse C of Pittsburgh International Airport, near the children's play area.[71] The Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Archives at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information is an academic resource and collection that contains correspondence, scripts, props, puppets, fan mail, 911 tapes including all but four episodes of the series on 3/4-inch production videotape; plus one on VHS (three other episodes are not in the collection) along with various videos of specials, interviews and scholarly articles that show the cultural impact of Fred Rogers' work.[72] A statue of Fred Rogers exists on the North Shore of the Allegheny River near Heinz Field at the surviving footing of the Manchester Bridge.[73] The original trolley from the shows is on display at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto, Ontario.[citation needed] A documentary feature film about the series, titled Won't You Be My Neighbor?, was released by Focus Features on June 8, 2018.[1][10][74] Another documentary, Mister Rogers & Me, was shown at film festivals in 2010 and on PBS stations in 2012.[75][76] An American drama film, titled A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood starring Tom Hanks as Rogers, was released on November 22, 2019 by TriStar Pictures.[77] On September 21, 2018, a Google Doodle was created in honor of Mr. Rogers.[78] In summer of 2023, a fan's Lego Ideas contest toy block creation of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood[79][80] received some 10,000 supporters for an official project set. It advanced to the Sep. 2023 review phase[81] but was turned down by the Lego Review Board in May 2024.[82] Music The music of the show was interpreted by an eclectic mix of modern artists for the 2005 album Songs From the Neighborhood: The Music of Mister Rogers. The YouTube show Pittsburgh Dad uses a piano theme song inspired by the jazz music constantly heard on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.[83] The musical project Symphony of Science, in association with PBS Digital Studios, created a music video called \"Garden of Your Mind\" from clips of the show, using Rogers' own pitch-corrected spoken words to create a song.

The museum is located in the former Engine House No. 25, in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania It features thousands of items of Clemente memorabilia, including professional sports photography, Clemente family snapshots, old uniforms, gloves, balls, bats, and seats from Forbes Field.[1][2] History[edit] The Roberto Clemente Museum was founded in 2007[1] by photographer Duane Rieder. Rieder had met Clemente's family in 1994 during a photo shoot. A decade later, his personal Clemente collection with help from Clemente's immediate family would serve as the basis for the museum.[3] In 2017, a charity auction featuring over 700 pieces of Roberto Clemente's memorabilia was held.[4] The roster included his 1960 and 1971 World Series ring.[5] Charitable causes[edit] The Clemente Museum carries on the giving legacy of Roberto Clemente. The museum organized local relief efforts upon hearing of the devastation of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.[6] They asked the community to donate $21, in honor of Clemente's number, for relief.[7] The efforts raised over $50,000 and filled two 43-foot tractor-trailers with supplies.[8] References[edit] ^ a b Nelson Jones, Diana (July 23, 2007). \"Clemente Museum brightens Lower Lawrenceville outlook\".

It is located northeast of downtown, and like many of the city's riverfront neighborhoods, it has an industrial past. The city officially divides Lawrenceville into three neighborhoods, Upper Lawrenceville, Central Lawrenceville, and Lower Lawrenceville, but these distinctions have little practical effect. Accordingly, Lawrenceville is almost universally treated as a single large neighborhood.[2] In 2019, the Lawrenceville Historic District, which encompasses the majority of the neighborhood, was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[3] History[edit] Lawrenceville was founded in 1814 by William B. Foster, father of composer Stephen Foster, who was born there in 1826. It is named for Captain James Lawrence, hero of the War of 1812, famous for his dying words, \"Don't Give Up The Ship!\"[4] Lawrenceville was selected as home to the Allegheny Arsenal, due to \"The area's accessibility to river transportation and its proximity to what was then the nation's only iron producing district\". Incorporated as a borough on February 18, 1834, Lawrenceville was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh in 1868.[5] One of the original buildings, a log home built in the 1820s, survived until July 2011 at 184 38th Street.[6] As seen on older maps, two sizable islands once sat opposite Lawrenceville in the Allegheny river: Herrs Island (now known as Washington's Landing), which stretched from roughly 28th street to 37th street, and McCullough's Island (sometimes labeled Wainwright's Island or \"Good Liquor\" Island), which stretched from roughly 35th street to 40th street.[7] Washington's Landing is named after an event in 1753 in which George Washington was thrown from his raft while crossing the Allegheny River and scrambled to safety on a nearby island. However, Washington did not actually land on Washington's Landing—he landed on McCullough's Island.[8] Although Washington's Landing still exists, McCullough's Island, which sat much closer to the mainland, does not. The channel between McCullough's Island and Lawrenceville was filled in between 1872 and 1882.[9][10][11] Present[edit] Lawrenceville's primary zip code is 15201, though a small section shares 15224 with Bloomfield and Garfield. The neighborhood is home to landmarks such as Allegheny Cemetery, Arsenal Middle School, Arsenal Park, and Doughboy Square. Lawrenceville maintains much of its industrial-era aesthetic, with narrow row houses and old warehouses lining streets and alleyways. The UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened a new facility in Lawrenceville on May 2, 2009, moving all patients from Oakland.[12] This addition has helped spawn Lawrenceville's transformation, bringing new job and business opportunities to the area. The New York Times has since called the neighborhood a \"go-to destination.\"[13] Lawrenceville's Butler Street is its main artery, housing a number of restaurants, bars, boutiques, furniture stores, and coffee shops.[14] Arsenal Lanes,[15] a longstanding bowling alley with a full-stocked bar. The Row House Cinema[16] opened in 2014, showing popular classics. Lawrenceville hosts Pittsburgh's annual Art All Night, an event for amateur artists to showcase their work in a large warehouse, open for free and to the public. In April 2016, the 19th Art All Night event was held in a new location at the Arsenal Terminal Building at 39th and Butler Streets.[17] Lawrenceville has experienced a real estate boom in recent years. In 2007, price appreciation was the second highest in the city, after the South Side, according to Carnegie Mellon University.[18] In 2015, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette[19] reported an increasingly high volume of developers looking to Lawrenceville to renovate properties for resale, also known as \"flipping\" houses, although such opportunities have become less lucrative as prices rise. Many homes now sell upwards of $200,000. As a result of this growth, Lawrenceville is typical of Pittsburgh's gentrification: once a working-class district, the neighborhood now caters to higher-earning buyers. Increases in construction and commercial enterprise have also led to a shortage of street parking,[20] as hundreds of drivers try to squeeze their cars onto too-narrow streets. Arsenal Park remains a popular recreation spot, hosting July 4 events each year, and the VFW center and Teamster Temple are active. Lawrenceville was used as a location for some scenes of the film Love & Other Drugs (2010), starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.[21] Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods[edit] Lower Lawrenceville has four land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Central Lawrenceville to the northeast, Bloomfield to the east, Polish Hill to the south, and the Strip District to the southwest. Across the Allegheny River, the Lower neighborhood runs adjacent with the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Troy Hill and Millvale with a direct link to the latter via 40th Street Bridge. Central Lawrenceville has five land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Upper Lawrenceville to the north, Stanton Heights to the east and northeast, Garfield to the southeast, Bloomfield to the south and Lower Lawrenceville to the southwest. Its adjacent neighborhoods across the Allegheny River include Millvale and Shaler Township. Upper Lawrenceville has three land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Morningside to the east, Stanton Heights to the southeast, and Central Lawrenceville to the south and southwest. The Upper section runs adjacent across the Allegheny River with Etna Boro, Sharpsburg and then Shaler Township.

In December 1972, Clemente died in the crash of a plane he had chartered to take emergency relief goods for the survivors of a massive earthquake in Nicaragua. After his sudden death, the National Baseball Hall of Fame changed its rules so that a player who had been dead for at least six months would be eligible for entry. In 1973, Clemente was posthumously inducted, becoming the first player from the Caribbean and second from Latin America (after Lefty Gomez in 1972) to be honored in the Hall of Fame. Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Clemente was a track and field star and an Olympic hopeful in his youth before deciding to turn his full attention to baseball. His professional career began at the age of eighteen, with the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. He quickly attracted the attention of the Brooklyn Dodgers who signed him to a bonus of $10,000. However, due to the bonus rule under which Clemente had signed and the Dodgers decision to send him to the minor leagues, they lost Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates who drafted him after the 1954 season. Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion. Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971). During the offseason, in addition to playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. The following season, the Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 21. In his honor, Major League baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award, given to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team\", to the Roberto Clemente Award. Early life[edit] Clemente was born on August 18, 1934, in Barrio San Antón in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Luisa Walker and Melchor Clemente. He was the youngest of seven siblings (three were from his mother's previous marriage). During Clemente's childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks.[3] Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. When he was fourteen, he was recruited by Roberto Marín to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Antón. He was with the team two years as a shortstop.[4] He attended Julio Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina where he was a track and field star, participating in the high jump and javelin throw. Clemente was considered good enough to represent Puerto Rico at the Olympics. He later stated that throwing the javelin helped in strengthening his arm and with his footwork and release.[5] Despite his all-around athletic skill, however, Clemente decided to focus on baseball and went on to join Puerto Rico's amateur league, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.[6] Professional career[edit] Puerto Rican baseball (1952–1954)[edit] Clemente's professional career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedrín Zorrilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce (\"Crabbers\"), a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR). Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team's leadoff hitter.[7] While Clemente was playing in the Puerto Rican League, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract of $15,000 – $10,000 bonus and $5000 league minimum salary. Clemente signed with them on February 19, 1954.[8] Minor league baseball (1954)[edit] At the time of Clemente's signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($56,000 today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons and failure to comply with the rule would result in the team losing the rights to that player's contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire.[9] As Clemente's bonus was larger than $4,000, he was considered a bonus baby. However, the Dodgers decided against benching him for two years in the majors and decided to place him with the Montreal Royals, their International League Triple-A affiliate. While it is often believed that the Dodgers instructed manager Max Macon to use Clemente sparingly to prevent him from being drafted under the Rule 5 Draft, Macon himself denied it. Box scores also suggest that Macon platooned Clemente the same as he did with other outfielders.[10] Affected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black.[b] Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' scouting trip to Richmond on June 1, 1954. Noticing Clemente in batting practice, Pirates scout Clyde Sukeforth made inquiries and soon learned about Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby.[12] Twelve years later, manager Macon acknowledged that \"we tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn't work\" but denied being instructed to not play Clemente, stating that the player needed time to develop and was struggling against Triple-A pitching.[13] However, Pittsburgh noticed his raw talents; as Sukeforth recalled years later, \"I knew then he'd be our first draft choice. I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt.\"[14] In 87 games with the Royals, Clemente hit .257 with two home runs.[15] The first home run of his North American baseball career came on July 25, 1954; Clemente's extra inning, walk-off home run was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement. His only other minor league home run came on September 5. On his 20th birthday, August 8, he made a notable game-ending outfield assist, cutting down the potential tying run at the plate.[16] At the end of the season, Clemente returned to play for Santurce where one of his teammates was Willie Mays.[17][18] While with the team, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954.[19] Major League Baseball (1955–1972)[edit] For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters.[20] For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente.[21] During the off-seasons (except the 1958–59, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1968–69, 1971–72, and 1972–73 seasons), Clemente played professionally for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, Criollos de Caguas, and Senadores de San Juan in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team. Clemente in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in September 1958. In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion.[22] The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles, caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, disappeared as a result of the training. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964.[23][24][25] Clemente would face racism throughout his Major League career, particularly from journalists. Former Pirates teammate Bill Mazeroski wrote that some sports writers, \"tried to make him look like an ass by getting him to say controversial things and then they wrote how the Puerto Rican hot dog was popping off again.\"[26] The language barrier between Clemente and the American journalists created a divide which led Clemente to be distrustful of the media. Mazeroski wrote that, \"writers who couldn't speak three words of Spanish tried to make him look silly, but he's an intelligent man who knows people and knows the game.\"[27] Clemente's disagreements with the media were exasperated by his open expression of anger at the continued discrimination in baseball.[28] His outspoken nature earned him a reputation for being hot-tempered that followed him through his career.[29] Early years[edit] The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948. Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying \"I don't believe in color.\" He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity. Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of African descent. The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts, their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers.[30] When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area.[31] During his rookie season, Clemente had to sit out several games, as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter. A speeding, drunk driver rammed into his car at an intersection. He finished his rookie season with a .255 batting average, despite trouble hitting certain types of pitches. His defensive skills were highlighted during this season. Clemente in 1957 The following season, on July 25, 1956, at Forbes Field, Clemente erased a three-run, ninth-inning deficit against the Chicago Cubs with a bases-clearing inside-the-park home run[32] off of pitcher Jim Brosnan[33], thus becoming the first—and, as yet, only—player in modern Major League history (since 1900) to hit a documented walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam.[34] While rounding third, Clemente ran through a stop sign from Pirates manager Bobby Bragan, a decision which infuriated Brosnan. In the October 24, 1960, edition of Life magazine, Brosnan wrote that Clemente's heroics, \"excited the fans, startled the manager, shocked me and disgusted my club.\"[35] After the game, Bragan announced that Clemente would not be fined the $25 that was the standard punishment for a player who missed a sign.[36] Pittsburgh-based sportswriter John Steigerwald said that a walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam, \"may have been done only once in the history of baseball.\"[37] Clemente was still fulfilling his Marine Corps Reserve duty during spring of 1959 and set to be released from Camp Lejeune until April 4. A Pennsylvania state senator, John M. Walker, wrote to US Senator Hugh Scott requesting an early release on March 4 so Clemente could join the team for spring training.[38] Stardom[edit] Early in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a .353 batting average, and the 14 extra-base hits and 25 RBIs recorded in May alone resulted in Clemente's selection as the National League's Player of the Month.[39] His batting average would remain above the .300 mark throughout the course of the campaign. On August 5 at Forbes Field, Clemente crashed into the right-field wall while making a pivotal play, depriving San Francisco's Willie Mays of a leadoff, extra-base hit in a game eventually won by Pittsburgh, 1–0. The resulting injury necessitated five stitches to the chin and a five-game layoff for Clemente, while the catch itself was described by Giants beat writer Bob Stevens as \"rank[ing] with the greatest of all time, as well as one of the most frightening to watch and painful to make.\"[40] The Pirates compiled a 95–59 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Clemente batted .310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game.[41] His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season (two All-Star games were held each season from 1959 through 1962).[42] During spring training in 1961, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler, Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing. During the 1961 season, Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 2 for 4; he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly. With the AL ahead 4–3 in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5–4 NL victory, culminating in Clemente's walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award.[42] Following the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda, who was a native of Ponce. When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people. During this time, he was also involved in managing the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh while doing some work at home but wanted to participate in the league's all-star game. He pinch-hit in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field. This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted .257. Although he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting lineup, he got hits in 33 out of 34 games and his batting average climbed up to .340.[42] He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15. Clemente in 1966 Clemente was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s other than 1968—the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed to hit above .300—and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final 12 seasons, beginning in 1961. He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league's MVP Award in 1966, hitting .317 with a career-high 29 home runs and 119 RBIs. In 1967, Clemente registered a career-high .357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs. Following that season, in an informal poll conducted by Sport Magazine at baseball's Winter Meetings, a plurality of major league GMs declared Clemente \"the best player in baseball today,\" edging out AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski by a margin of 8 to 6, with one vote each going to Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Bill Freehan and Ron Santo.[43] In an effort to make him seem more American, sportswriters started calling him \"Bob\" or \"Bobby\". His baseball cards even listed him as \"Bob Clemente\", a practice that persisted through to 1969. He disliked the practice, which he felt was disrespectful to his Puerto Rican and Latino heritage. Clemente would correct reporters who referred to him as \"Bob\" during post-game interviews, but the issue continued throughout the 1960s.[44] Final seasons[edit] The 1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente said that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, \"I spent half my life there.\" The night of July 24, 1970, was declared \"Roberto Clemente Night\"; on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request. During the 1970 season, Clemente compiled a .352 batting average; the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. During the offseason, Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and underwent surgery. In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore had won 101 games (third season in row with 100+ wins) and swept the American League Championship Series, both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente had a .414 batting average (12 hits in 29 at-bats), performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2–1 seventh game victory.[45] Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[42] Although he was frustrated and struggling with injuries,[46] Clemente played in 102 games and hit .312 during the 1972 season.[45] He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the fifteenth (15th) time (he played in 14/15 All-Star games)[47] and won his twelfth consecutive Gold Glove. On September 30, he hit a double in the fourth inning off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th.[48][49] It was his last regular season at-bat of his career. By playing in right field in one more regular season game, on October 3, Clemente tied Honus Wagner's record for games played as a Pittsburgh Pirate, with 2,433 games played. In the NL playoffs that season, he batted .235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972, at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of the 1972 NLCS, won by the Reds in the bottom of the 9th inning. Clemente had his final hit (single) in the 1st inning; his final plate appearance was an intentional walk in the 8th inning.[45] He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series championship team. Charity work and death[edit] Further information: 1972 Puerto Rico DC-7 crash Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. He also visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series.[50] When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights.[51] He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake.[52] He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.[53] The airplane which he chartered for the New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg).[54] It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.[55] A search and rescue effort was immediately launched, led by the USCGC Sagebrush.[56] A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case which apparently belonged to Clemente was the only personal item of his which was recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was the only member of the Pirates who did not attend Roberto's memorial service. Instead, the Pirates catcher chose to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane were never recovered.[55] Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico, had helped him load the plane. Because Clemente wanted Walker, who was single, to go and enjoy New Year's Eve,[57] Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. A few hours later, Walker returned to his condo and discovered that the plane carrying Clemente had crashed.[58] Immediately following Clemente's death, a relief-aid organization for the victims of the Nicaraguan earthquake was created in his name. President Richard Nixon was one of the most prominent contributors to Roberto Clemente Memorial Fund. Shortly after the inception of the fund, donations grew to $350,000.[59] In an interview for the ESPN documentary series SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her that he thought he was going to die young several times.[30] Indeed, while he was being asked when he would get his 3,000th career hit by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities, Clemente's response was \"Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow.\"[60] Career overall[edit] At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including most triples in a single game (three) and hits in two consecutive games (ten).[61] He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won among outfielders with Willie Mays.[62][63] Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games.[c] He won the NL MVP Award in 1966, and was named NL Player of the Month Award three times (May 1960, May 1967, July 1969). Clemente led the Pirates to two World Series titles, being named World Series MVP in 1971.[42] Clemente had two three-home run games in his career, as well as eight five-hit games in MLB.[65] Category G BA AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI SB CS BB SO OBP SLG OPS E A PO FLD% Ref.

On March 20, 1973, the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 out of 424 available votes, for 92.7% of the votes.[d][68] Clemente's number 21 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 6, 1973, a few months after his election to the Hall of Fame.[69][70] There have been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide, as was done with Jackie Robinson's number 42 in 1997, but the sentiment has been opposed by the Robinson family.[71] In 1999, Clemente was ranked number 20 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking Latin American and Caribbean player on the list.[72] Later that year, he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[73] In 2020, The Athletic ranked Clemente at number 40 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.[74] In 2007, Clemente was selected for the All Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team for the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Gold Glove Award.[75] He was named to Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team in 2005.[76] In 1973, Major League Baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award to the Roberto Clemente Award. It has been awarded every year to a player with outstanding baseball playing skills who is personally involved in community work. A trophy and a donation check for a charity of the player's choice are presented annually at the World Series.[77] Clemente was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010,[78] and the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2003, he was also inducted into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.[79] Near the old Forbes Field where Clemente began his major league career, the city of Pittsburgh renamed a street in his honor.[80] Additionally, the city named Roberto Clemente Memorial Park in his honor. At Pirate City, the Pirates spring training home in Bradenton, Florida, a section of 27th Street East is named Roberto Clemente Memorial Highway.[81] The United States Postal Service issued a Roberto Clemente postal stamp on August 17, 1984.[82] The stamp was designed by Juan Lopez-Bonilla and shows Clemente wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap with a Puerto Rican flag in the background.[83] A statue of Clemente outside of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. The Pirates originally erected a statue in memory of Clemente at Three Rivers Stadium, just before the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It has since been moved to PNC Park when it opened in 2001, and stands outside the park's centerfield gates.[84] In 1974, the Harlem River State Park in Morris Heights, The Bronx, New York City, was renamed Roberto Clemente State Park in his honor. In 2013, forty years after his election to the Hall of Fame, a statue was unveiled at the park. It was the first statue honoring a Puerto Rican to be unveiled in New York City.[85] In 2012, the Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League (LBPPR) was renamed Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, the number 21 was also permanently retired.[86] A number of schools have been named after Clemente, including the Roberto Clemente Community Academy in Chicago,[87] and the Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown, Pennsylvania.[88] In 2002, 30 years after his death, Major League Baseball proclaimed September 15 as \"Roberto Clemente Day\".[89] In 1973, President Richard Nixon posthumously honored Clemente with the Presidential Citizens Medal.[90] That same day, Congress honored Clemente with the Congressional Gold Medal.[91] In 2003, President George W. Bush awarded Clemente the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[92] Clemente is an iconic sports figure in Puerto Rico, widely revered by his people. In 2022, the government of Puerto Rico granted Clemente the formal recognition of prócer (national hero).[93] The Coliseo Roberto Clemente, opened in 1973 in San Juan, and Estadio Roberto Clemente, opened in 2000 in Carolina, are both named in his honor.[94] Personal life[edit] Clemente was married on November 14, 1964 to Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto (often referred to as \"Roberto Jr.\"), born in 1965; Luis Roberto, born in 1966; and Roberto Enrique, born in 1969.[95] Vera Clemente died on November 16, 2019, aged 78.[96][97] Clemente was a devout Catholic.[98] In the 2010s, there was an initiative to have him canonized by the Catholic Church.[99][100] See also[edit] List of Gold Glove Award winners at outfield List of baseball players who died during their careers List of Major League Baseball batting champions List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders List of Major League Baseball career batting average leaders List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders List of Major League Baseball career extra base hits leaders List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders List of Major League Baseball career total bases leaders List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico List of Major League Baseball players who spent their entire career with one franchise List of Puerto Rican Presidential Citizens Medal recipients List of Puerto Rican Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients Notes[edit] ^ Both a 1955 interview with Clemente and a 1994 interview with his wife Vera confirm that Clemente's full name includes the middle name, Enrique. The discrepancy in spelling – 1994's 'Enrique' vs. 1955's E-n-r-i-c-q-u-e (as allegedly spelled out for the interviewer by Clemente) – is presumably due to a misunderstanding on the part of the Post-Gazette's non-Spanish-speaking interviewer, likely mistaking the word \"Si\" for the letter c.[1][2] ^ To what extent Lasorda assisted Clemente is open to debate. Fellow Royals hurler Joe Black categorically denies Lasorda's characterization of Clemente as unable to \"speak one word of English\": \"I saw him on the field and I said, 'Tommy, why did you tell that story?' He said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'One: Clemente didn't hang out with you. Second: Clemente speaks English.' ... Puerto Rico, you know, is part of the United States. So, over there, youngsters do have the privilege of taking English in classrooms. He wouldn't give a speech like Shakespeare, but he knew how to order breakfast and eggs. He knew how to say, 'it's a good day,' 'let's play,' or 'why I don't play?' He could say, 'Let's go to the movies.'\"[11] ^ Major League Baseball held two All-Star Games for the years from 1959 to 1962.[64] ^ Clemente's Hall of Fame plaque originally had his name as \"Roberto Walker Clemente\" instead of the proper Spanish format \"Roberto Clemente Walker\"; the plaque was recast in 2000 to correct the error.[66] Both plaques are currently on display in the Hall of Fame, the new one in the plaque gallery and the original in the “sandlot kids clubhouse” area.[67] References[edit] ^ Abrams, Al (June 7, 1955). \"Sidelight on Sports: A Baseball Star is Born\".

The Pennsylvania historical plaque honoring Jonas Salk's research conducted in Salk Hall that resulted in the first polio vaccine can be seen at the bottom right. Salk Hall from the rear Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pennsylvania state[2] and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark.[3] The Art Deco building is named after Jonas Salk, who conducted his research on the first polio vaccine in a basement laboratory while on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh.[4] Jonas Salk in 1955 holds bottles of a culture used to grow polio vaccines History[edit] The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city. It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz.[5] The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration.[6] The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city. Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health.[7] In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.6 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall. For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students. Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962.[8] Annex[edit] The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel[9] for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967[10] for a cost of over $5 million ($49.9 million today).[11] Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics. A new $50.6 million ($73 million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010.[12] It will include the construction of an 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m2) research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure.[13] The target completion date is July, 2014. Dental Museum[edit] A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall. The museum contains a variety of original dental artifacts, including a c. 1910 dental chair, and x-ray machine and instrument cabinet from the 1920s.[14] Pharmacy Museum[edit] Also contained in Salk Hall is the Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum,[15] which opened in the fall of 1996. Located on the fourth floor, the museum holds pharmacy memorabilia such as drug products, equipment, and sundry products dating back to the early 20th century. Among the museum's possessions are two hand-carved finials, which were often found over the door or partitions that separated the main part of the pharmacy from the back room where pharmacists did most of their work, an old-fashioned powder mill, and a konseal machine.[16][17] References[edit] ^ Historic Landmark Plaques 1968-2009 (PDF), Pittsburgh, PA: Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, 2010, p. 5, retrieved June 26, 2010 ^ \"Salk Polio Vaccine\".

PharmacyOccupationNamesPharmacist, Chemist, Doctor of Pharmacy, Druggist, Apothecary or simply DoctorOccupation typeProfessionalActivity sectorsHealth care, health sciences, chemical sciencesDescriptionEducation requiredDoctor of Pharmacy, Master of Pharmacy, Bachelor of Pharmacy, Diploma in PharmacyRelated jobsPhysician, pharmacy technician, toxicologist, chemist, pharmacy assistant, other medical specialists The Green Pharmacy Cross (sometimes overlaid with Bowl of Hygieia), is widely used in Europe and India[citation needed] on pharmacy signs. A medication is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. The Apothecary or The Chemist by Gabriël Metsu (c. 1651–67) Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications, aiming to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines. It is a miscellaneous science as it links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and natural sciences. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, pharmacy practice is either classified as community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies is considered clinical pharmacy.[1] The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications. It also includes more modern services related to health care including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information with patient counselling. Pharmacists, therefore, are experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients. An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a pharmacy (this term is more common in the United States) or chemists (which is more common in Great Britain, though pharmacy is also used).[citation needed] In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines, as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products and magazines, and occasionally refreshments and groceries. In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the apothecary may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology, prior to the formulation of the scientific method.[citation needed] Disciplines[edit] Pharmacy, Tacuinum sanitatis casanatensis (14th century) The field of pharmacy can generally be divided into various disciplines: Pharmaceutics and Computational Pharmaceutics Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy Pharmacology Pharmacy Practice Pharmacoinformatics Pharmacogenomics The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut. Often, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology. Pharmacology is sometimes considered the fourth discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline. Pharmacoinformatics is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety. Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs.[2] Professionals[edit] The World Health Organization estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.[3] Pharmacists[edit] Main article: Pharmacist See also: List of pharmacy associations Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialized education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual. Pharmacists are represented internationally by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), an NGO linked with World Health Organization (WHO). They are represented at the national level by professional organisations such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the UK, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA), Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA), Indian Pharmacist Association (IPA), Pakistan Pharmacists Association (PPA), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and the Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society (MPS).[4] In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and ethics of the profession. In the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties include: cardiovascular, infectious disease, oncology, pharmacotherapy, nuclear, nutrition, and psychiatry.[5] The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied toxicology. Pharmacy support staff[edit] A pharmacy worker distributing drugs to an old woman at a local clinic. Pharmacy technicians[edit] Main article: Pharmacy technician Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises. In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications. Some states have a legally mandated pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio. Dispensing assistants[edit] Dispensing assistants are commonly referred to as \"dispensers\" and in community pharmacies perform largely the same tasks as a pharmacy technician. They work under the supervision of pharmacists and are involved in preparing (dispensing and labelling) medicines for provision to patients. Healthcare assistants/medicines counter assistants[edit] In the UK, this group of staff can sell certain medicines (including pharmacy only and general sales list medicines) over the counter. They cannot prepare prescription-only medicines for supply to patients. History[edit] Main articles: History of pharmacy and List of pharmacists Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from Medicinarius (1505) by Hieronymus Brunschwig The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the Sushruta Samhita, an Indian Ayurvedic treatise attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD. Many Sumerian (4th millennium BC – early 2nd millennium BC) cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine.[6] Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of the 16th century BC. Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, Byzantium, 15th century In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic.[7] The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five-volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances) was used as a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age, themselves deriving their knowledge from earlier Greek Byzantine medicine.[8] Pharmacy in China dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the Shennong Bencao Jing (The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the Han dynasty and was attributed to the mythical Shennong. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the Mawangdui, sealed in 168 BC. In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538–710) and the early Nara period (710–794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.[9] There is a stone sign for a pharmacy shop with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus near Kusadasi in Turkey.[10] The current Ephesus dates back to 400 BC and was the site of the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world. In Baghdad the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754,[11] under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. By the 9th century, these pharmacies were state-regulated.[12][unreliable source?] The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the \"simples\" from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to record his findings in a pharmacopoeia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[13][verification needed] In Europe, pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240, emperor Frederic II issued a decree by which the physician's and the apothecary's professions were separated.[14] Löwen-Apotheke in Trier, operating continuously from at least 1241 Sign of the Town Hall Pharmacy in Tallinn, operating continuously from at least 1422, showing the Bowl of Hygieia There are pharmacies in Europe that have been in operation since medieval times. In Florence, Italy, the director of the museum in the former Santa Maria Novella pharmacy says that the pharmacy there dates back to 1221.[15] In Trier (Germany), the Löwen-Apotheke is in operation since 1241, the oldest pharmacy in Europe in continuous operation.[16] In Dubrovnik (Croatia), a pharmacy that first opened in 1317 is located inside the Franciscan monastery: it is the 2nd oldest pharmacy in Europe that is still operating.[17][18] In the Town Hall Square of Tallinn (Estonia), there is a pharmacy dating from at least 1422.[citation needed] The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Llívia, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerdà, is a museum: the building dates back to the 15th century and the museum keeps albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs. Practice areas[edit] Pharmacists practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies, infusion pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, medical communication companies, research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, extended care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and regulatory agencies. Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a medical specialty. Community pharmacy[edit] Main article: Pharmacy (shop) See also: Community pharmacy and Pharmacy automation A pharmacy in Klaukkala, Finland A pharmacy (also known as a chemist in Australia, New Zealand and the British Isles; or drugstore in North America; retail pharmacy in industry terminology; or apothecary, historically) is where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers. Community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by Muslim pharmacists in Baghdad in 754 AD.[11][19] Hospital pharmacy[edit] Main article: Hospital pharmacy Pharmacies within hospitals differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues. Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency, sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy. For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more. Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible. Clinical pharmacy[edit] Main article: Clinical pharmacy Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.[20] Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection. In the UK clinical pharmacists can also prescribe some medications for patients on the NHS or privately, after completing a non-medical prescribers course to become an Independent Prescriber.[21] The clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. Research shows that pharmacist led strategies reduce errors related to medication use.[22] The pharmacist must also consider potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.[23] Ambulatory care pharmacy[edit] Since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states. In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states, such as North Carolina and New Mexico, these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.[24] In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.[25] Compounding pharmacy/industrial pharmacy[edit] Main article: Compounding Compounding involves preparing drugs in forms that are different from the generic prescription standard. This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form.[26] Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need. One area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead. Another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical pharmacist practitioner. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy. Compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies. Consultant pharmacy[edit] Main article: Consultant pharmacist The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (December 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \"cognitive services\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.[27] Traditionally[where?] consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare or PharMerica. This trend may be gradually reversing[citation needed] as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services. The main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.[28][29] Veterinary pharmacy[edit] Main article: Veterinary pharmacy Veterinary pharmacies, sometimes called animal pharmacies, may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals. Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on veterinary medicine, are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be kept separate from regular pharmacies. Nuclear pharmacy[edit] Main article: Nuclear pharmacy Nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients. Military pharmacy[edit] The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (December 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt. Giovanni Fiorito, 332nd Expeditionary Medical Group pharmacy technicians, fill prescription medication for patients, Oct. 7, Joint Base Balad Iraq. Military pharmacy is a different working environment to civilian practise because military pharmacy technicians perform duties such as evaluating medication orders, preparing medication orders, and dispensing medications. This would be illegal in civilian pharmacies because these duties are required to be performed by a licensed registered pharmacist.[30] In the US military, state laws that prevent technicians from counseling patients or doing the final medication check prior to dispensing to patients (rather than a pharmacist solely responsible for these duties) do not apply. Pharmacy informatics[edit] Main article: Pharmacy informatics Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.[31] Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies. As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment, and optimization. Specialty pharmacy[edit] Main article: Specialty pharmacy Specialty pharmacies supply high-cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.[32] Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed.[33] In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.[34] In the US, it is currently the fastest-growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.[35] Due to the demand for clinicians who can properly manage these specific patient populations, the Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board has developed a new certification exam to certify specialty pharmacists. Along with the 100 questions computerized multiple-choice exam, pharmacists must also complete 3,000 hours of specialty pharmacy practice within the past three years as well as 30 hours of specialty pharmacist continuing education within the past two years.[36] Pharmaceutical sciences[edit] \"Pharmaceutical research\" redirects here.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: \"Pharmacy\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The pharmaceutical sciences are a group of interdisciplinary areas of study concerned with the design, manufacturing, action, delivery, and classification of drugs. They apply knowledge from chemistry (inorganic, physical, biochemical and analytical), biology (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology), epidemiology, statistics, chemometrics, mathematics, physics, and chemical engineering.[37] The pharmaceutical sciences are further subdivided into several specific specialties, with four main branches: Pharmacology: the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on human beings. Pharmacodynamics: the study of the cellular and molecular interactions of drugs with their receptors. Simply \"What the drug does to the body\"[38] Pharmacokinetics: the study of the factors that control the concentration of drug at various sites in the body. Simply \"What the body does to the drug\"[39] Pharmaceutical toxicology: the study of the harmful or toxic effects of drugs. [citation needed] Pharmacogenomics: the study of the inheritance of characteristic patterns of interaction between drugs and organisms.[40] Pharmaceutical chemistry: the study of drug design to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and synthesis of new drug molecules (Medicinal Chemistry). Pharmaceutics: the study and design of drug formulation for optimum delivery, stability, pharmacokinetics, and patient acceptance.[41] Pharmacognosy: the study of medicines derived from natural sources.[42] As new discoveries advance and extend the pharmaceutical sciences, subspecialties continue to be added to this list. Importantly, as knowledge advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of pharmaceutical research and drug therapy. Pharmacocybernetics (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the pharmaceutical care of patients.[43] Society and culture[edit] Etymology[edit] The word pharmacy is derived from Old French farmacie \"substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect\" from Medieval Latin pharmacia from Greek pharmakeia (Ancient Greek: φαρμακεία) \"a medicine\", which itself derives from pharmakon (φάρμακον), meaning \"drug, poison, spell\"[44][45][a] (which is etymologically related to pharmakos). Separation of prescribing and dispensing[edit] Main article: Separation of prescribing and dispensing Separation of prescribing and dispensing, also called dispensing separation, is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs. In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces conflict of interest in the healthcare industry, unnecessary health care, and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances. Environmental impacts[edit] In 2022 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposed that pharmaceutical companies should be required to collect and destroy unused or expired medicines that they have put on the market in order to reduce public health risks around the misuse of medicines obtained from waste bins, the development of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from the discharge of antibiotics into environmental systems and \"economic losses\" from wasted healthcare resources. Potentially harmful concentrations of pharmaceutical waste has been detected in more than a quarter of water samples taken from 258 rivers around the world. OECD recommend that medicines should be collected separately from household waste and that \"marketplaces and redistribution platforms for unused close-to-expiry-date medicines\" should be set up. Such extended producer responsibility schemes are already running in France, Spain and Portugal.[47] The future of pharmacy[edit] Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction. In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.[48] In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.[49][unreliable source?] This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.[50] Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes, are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy\".[51] In addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows \"pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group\".[52] Pharmacy journals[edit] List of pharmaceutical sciences journals Symbols[edit] The symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy are the mortar and pestle (North America) and the ℞ (medical prescription) character, which is often written as \"Rx\" in typed text; the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India; the Bowl of Hygieia (only) often used in the Netherlands but may be seen combined with other symbols elsewhere. Other common symbols include conical measures, and (in the US) caduceuses, in their logos. A red stylized letter A in used Germany and Austria (from Apotheke, the German word for pharmacy, from the same Greek root as the English word \"apothecary\"). The show globe was used in the US until the early 20th century; the Gaper in the Netherlands is increasingly rare. Rod of Asclepius, the internationally recognised symbol of medicine green cross (AIGA symbol for First Aid) Green cross and Bowl of Hygieia used in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Austria) and India Simple green Greek cross, widely used in Europe and India,[citation needed] often an animated neon sign Red \"A\" (Apotheke) sign, used in Germany Similar red \"A\" sign, used in Austria The mortar and pestle, used in the United States and Canada A hanging Show globe, formerly used in the United States The Gaper, formerly used in the Netherlands The symbol used on medical prescriptions, from the Latin recipe (take thou). the Bowl of Hygieia See also[edit] American Society for Pharmacy Law – Professional organization Apothecary – Former name for a pharmacist Bachelor of Pharmacy, Master of Pharmacy, Doctor of Pharmacy Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals – Taxonomy of cases requiring referral Clinical pharmacy – Branch of pharmacy for direct provision Consultant pharmacist – Provider of expert pharmaceutical advice Drug packaging – Packaging for pharmaceutical preparations Evidence-based pharmacy in developing countries Health informatics – Computational approaches to health care History of pharmacy Hospital pharmacy – Dispensary within a hospital International Pharmaceutical Federation International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation List of drugs by year of discovery List of pharmaceutical laboratories by year of foundation List of pharmacies List of pharmacy associations List of pharmacy organizations in the United Kingdom List of pharmacy schools in the United States List of pharmacy schools Nuclear pharmacy – Branch of pharmacy focused on radioactive pharmaceuticals Online pharmacy – Pharmacy that operates over the Internet Pharmaceutics – Science of the properties of medicines Pharmaceutical industry – Industry involved with discovery, development, production and marketing of drugs Pharmacogenomics – Study of the role of the genome in drug response Pharmacognosy – Study of drugs obtained from natural sources Pharmacology – Science of drugs and medications and their effects Pharmaconomist – Danish qualification like BPharm Pharmacy automation – Mechanical handling of medications Pharmacy residency – Post-graduate internship Professional Further Education in Clinical Pharmacy and Public Health – academic publisherPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback Raeapteek – One of Europe's longest-lived pharmacies Telepharmacy – Pharmacy care by telecommunication Notes[edit] ^ Its earliest attested form in Greek could be the Mycenaean 𐀞𐀔𐀒, pa-ma-ko, written in the Linear B syllabic script and found on the PY Un 1314 tablet; this tablet is also found listed as PY Vn 1314 or PY Sb 1314.[46] References[edit] ^ Thomas D (November 2018).

The university is composed of seventeen undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its urban Pittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and around 28,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus includes various historic buildings that are part of the Schenley Farms Historic District, most notably its 42-story Gothic revival centerpiece, the Cathedral of Learning. Pitt is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[7] It is the second-largest non-government employer in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Pitt traces its roots to the Pittsburgh Academy founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge in 1787. While the city was still on the edge of the American frontier at the time, Pittsburgh's rapid growth meant that a proper university was soon needed, and Pitt's charter was altered in 1819 to confer university status on it as the Western University of Pennsylvania. After surviving two devastating fires and several relocations, the university moved to its current location in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, and by act of the state legislature was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966, when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. The campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and its flagship hospital, UPMC Presbyterian, as well as the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Schenley Park, and Carnegie Mellon University. The university also operates four undergraduate branch campuses in Western Pennsylvania, located in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville. In athletics, Pitt competes in Division I of the NCAA as the Pittsburgh Panthers, primarily as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. History[edit] Hugh Henry Brackenridge, founder of Pittsburgh Academy, the precursor to the University of Pittsburgh Main article: History of the University of Pittsburgh Founding[edit] Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the Allegheny Mountains.[8] The school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin, possibly as early as 1770[9] in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.[10] Brackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.[11][12] A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.[13][14] The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.[15] Western University of Pennsylvania[edit] The university in 1833 at its location on 3rd Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school was named the Western University of Pennsylvania, or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.[12][16] By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the state legislature's desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.[17] It was also during this era that the founder of Mellon Bank, Thomas Mellon (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.[18][13][14] The university's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1845 that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in Trinity Church until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former Horne's department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day City-County building) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that Samuel Pierpont Langley, astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was chosen as director of the Allegheny Observatory that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, James Keeler. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[18][13][14] The university eventually found itself on a 10-acre (4.0 ha) site on the North Side's Observatory Hill at the location of its Allegheny Observatory. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university (now the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American, William Hunter Dammond.[19] In 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and Andrew Carnegie and George Westinghouse were elected to the board of trustees, where they joined Andrew Mellon, who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university.[20] During this period, university engineering professor Reginald Fessenden was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at Exposition Park, the university had its first undefeated football team.[18][13][14][21] A new name and home[edit] The Cathedral of Learning, the centerpiece of Pitt's campus and the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere Citing a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought 43 acres (17 ha) of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.[22] The initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by Henry Hornbostel for 30 buildings.[23] However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only Thaw Hall remains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the panther as its mascot.[24] It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor Samuel McCormick, again held off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.[23] In the 1920s, new university chancellor John Gabbert Bowman declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece \"tall building\" for the university. The 14 acres (5.7 ha) Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-Gothic Revival plan that today comprises the Cathedral of Learning, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Clapp Hall buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by Charles Klauder for the \"tall building\": an attention-getting 535-foot (163 m) tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the \"character that ought to be in an educated man.\" The building's \"parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness\" and it would \"unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.\" The cathedral is \"cut off\" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the Great Depression intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) Gothic hall Commons Room with 52-foot (16 m) tall arches currently surrounded by 31 Nationality Rooms. Development of the polio vaccine[edit] Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh. In the early 20th century, epidemics of polio began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in iron lungs, and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas Salk had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now Salk Hall. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the vaccine developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.[25][26] State relations to present day[edit] In 1966, Pitt was designated by Pennsylvania as a state-related university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3 million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget,[27] and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett and continued success in the 1980s with players such as Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of organ transplantation was conducted by Thomas Starzl, establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor Wesley Posvar retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million.[28] Mark Nordenberg was chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal[29] and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.[30] Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the Petersen Events Center, a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of disruptive bomb threats that occurred in 2012. Patrick D. Gallagher was named the 18th chancellor of the university and assumed the office on August 1, 2014.[31] Campus[edit] The Pittsburgh Athletic Association building, one of several Pitt buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is pictured to the left of Alumni Hall, both Benno Janssen designed buildings that are examples of Renaissance Revival and Greek Revial architecture, respectively. The University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53 km2) located in Pittsburgh's historic Oakland neighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story Cathedral of Learning, falls within the Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District.[32] The campus has been noted for its impressive architecture,[33] and contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern. It has been termed \"a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.\"[34] The campus has won multiple Green Star Awards from the Professional Grounds Management Society.[35][36][37] The University of Pittsburgh's main campus contains four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, residence halls); mid (Benedum, Chevron, Allen and Thaw Halls); lower (Cathedral of Learning, Union, Posvar Hall); and on the west end of campus, the medical center complex. The campus is bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east. Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a bus and shuttle service between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods.[38] The main campus is within walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions in the Oakland neighborhood. The campus is adjacent to Schenley Plaza, the main branch of the Carnegie Public Library, the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art and the Carnegie Music Hall, as well as portions of Carnegie Mellon University. Carlow University is just west of campus, adjacent to the university's medical center complexes. The main quad of Carnegie Mellon University, Central Catholic High School, and historic Schenley Park, site of the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, lie across Junction Hollow on the east end. Historic buildings[edit] Heinz Memorial Chapel Four Pitt buildings are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Allegheny Observatory (in Pittsburgh's Riverview Park on the Northside), the Cathedral of Learning,[39] the Pittsburgh Athletic Association building, and the Ford Motor building. Twenty-one of Pitt's buildings (including the 5 residence halls that make up Schenley Quadrangle, see below) are contributing properties to the Schenley Farms-Oakland Civic Center Historic District that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.[32] Due to the historical nature of various sites around Pitt's buildings, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has placed historical markers outside the Allegheny Observatory,[40] Posvar Hall,[41][42] Salk Hall,[43] Stephen Foster Memorial,[44] and the William Pitt Union.[45] In addition, a Pennsylvania Historical Marker has been placed on campus near the Cathedral of Learning to mark the significance of the University of Pittsburgh itself.[46] Another state historical marker has been placed to highlight the significance of Pitt's involvement in the archaeological excavation at the Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Avella, Pennsylvania.[47] In addition, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has designated the following Pitt buildings as Pittsburgh Historic Landmarks: Allegheny Observatory, Allen Hall, Alumni Hall, Bellefield Hall, Chancellor's Residence, Cathedral of Learning, the Cathedral of Learning interior rooms, Gardner Steel Conference Center, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Thaw Hall, Salk Hall, Schenley Quadrangle residence halls, Stephen Foster Memorial, the University Child Development Center, and the William Pitt Union.[48][49] Other Pitt buildings not designated individually as landmarks, but listed among the 16 Pitt-owned contributing properties to the Schenley Farms Historic District, include Clapp Hall, O'Hara Student Center, Ruskin Hall, Thackeray Hall, Frick Fine Arts Building, Music Building, and the University Club.[50] The restored Louis XV mirrored ballroom of the Beaux-Arts styled William Pitt Union Historic structures within, adjacent to, or near Pitt's campus, but not belonging to the university, include the Carnegie Museum buildings, Frick School, Forbes Field wall remnant, Magee Estate iron fence, the Schenley Fountain, Mellon Institute, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Schenley High School, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall – where scenes of The Silence of the Lambs were filmed in 1990, and the Stephen Foster sculpture. Many of these buildings and their facilities are integrated into the events and activities of the university.[51][52][53] Other buildings[edit] Main article: List of University of Pittsburgh buildings The art gallery at the Frick Fine Arts Building The majority of Pitt-owned facilities are clustered in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh which includes the Schenley Farms Historic District, however a few prominent facilities are scattered elsewhere throughout the city, including the adjacent Shadyside neighborhood. Pitt also maintains regional Pennsylvania campuses in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville, as well as a Computer Center in RIDC Park in Blawnox, the Plum Boro Science Center in Plum, the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (U-PARC) in Harmarville, and the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology in Linesville.[54] The university also has a major archeological research site, the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve, in Spring Creek, Wyoming.[55][56] Athletic facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Panthers that are located in Oakland in the upper campus and include the Charles L Cost Sports Center, Fitzgerald Field House, the Petersen Events Center, Trees Hall and Trees Field. An approximately $30 million upgrade of on-campus sports facilities, starting with the Petersen Sports Complex, includes new soccer, baseball, softball facilities, and helps clear a space for the future construction of a new track and field and band complex.[57] Athletic facilities in Pittsburgh that are located outside of the Oakland neighborhood include Acrisure Stadium and the UPMC Sports Performance Complex.[58] Major on-campus residence halls include the Litchfield Towers, Schenley Quadrangle, Forbes Hall, Bouquet Gardens and Ruskin Hall located on the lower campus, Lothrop Hall on the medical campus, and Panther, Nordenberg Hall, and Sutherland halls located on the upper campus.[59] University of Pittsburgh Medical Center[edit] See also: List of UPMC buildings in Pittsburgh Thomas Starzl Biomedical Science Tower is connected to the med school and UPMC's flagship hospitals The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is consistently ranked in U.S. News & World Report's \"Honor Roll\" of America's top hospitals[60] and consists of the following hospitals and facilities in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Oakland, many of which have shared uses with various University departments: UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, UPMC Montefiore Hospital, Magee-Women's Hospital of UPMC, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Thomas Detre Hall, Eye and Ear Institute, Forbes Tower (home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences), Iroquois Building, Kaufman Medical Building, Medical Arts Building, 230 McKee Place, and UPMC University Center. UPMC academic hospitals and facilities elsewhere in Pittsburgh include the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh campus in the Lawrenceville neighborhood, the UPMC Sports Performance Complex on the South Side, and the UPMC Shadyside and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute in the Hillman Cancer Center (both located in the Shadyside neighborhood adjacent to Oakland).[61] Regional campuses[edit] Regional campuses offer master's, bachelor's, and associate degrees at four locations in Western Pennsylvania. They also allow students to take preliminary courses and relocate to other regional campuses or the Oakland campus to complete their degrees. They offer several degrees and certificates: University of Pittsburgh at Bradford – master's, bachelor's, associate's and certificates University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg – master's, bachelor's and certificates University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown – bachelor's and certificates University of Pittsburgh at Titusville – associate's and certificates Community impact[edit] Aerial view of the university and Oakland neighborhood; Carnegie Mellon University is at top-right The University of Pittsburgh has been noted for both its role in community outreach and its impact on the economy of the city and the Western Pennsylvania region. In 2009, Pitt was ranked second overall, and the top public university in the nation, as a \"Best Neighbor\" for positive impact on its urban community, including both commercial and residential activities such as revitalization, cultural renewal, economics, and community service and development according to the \"Saviors of Our Cities\" ranking.[62] Pitt was also listed as a \"best neighbor\" in the previous ranking released in 2006.[63] These rankings reflect the statistics that each year Pitt spends more than $1.7 billion in the community and supports nearly 33,800 jobs in Allegheny County. The university is the Pittsburgh region's second largest non-government employer behind its affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).[64] Pitt's research program alone imports more than $822 million into the region each year (more than $3.60 for each $1 of state appropriations), and supports some 23,100 local jobs.[65][13][22] Pitt students also spend more than $213 million on goods, services, and rental payments within the local economy.[66] Pitt ranked sixth in the number of startups spawned by technologies developed by its researchers according to Association of University Technology Managers.[67] Then-Vice President of the United States Joe Biden speaks at the Petersen Events Center on April 5, 2016. Pitt and its medical school are the academic partners of the closely affiliated the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. With over 1450 employees and $1 billion annual revenue, UPMC is the largest non-government employer in Pennsylvania.[68] Through the Pitt Volunteer Pool, faculty and staff members donate more than 10,000 hours annually to community service projects for agencies such as the Salvation Army, Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Pitt is a leading producer of Peace Corps volunteers.[66][69] According to the Peace Corps' 2008 ranking of colleges and universities, only 14 schools in the nation produced more Peace Corps volunteers.[70] Pitt's graduate school also ranked tenth for most alumni Peace Corps volunteers.[71] Sustainability[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(April 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The University of Pittsburgh has undertaken programs to improve sustainability initiatives and practices. Pitt started programs in ecology and established biological field stations in 1926.[72] In 1990, Pitt was one of the first 22 signatories of the Talloires Declaration.[73] In 2003, Pitt founded its Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation.[74][75] In 2013, Pitt released its first sustainability report[76] and in 2014 celebrated a \"Year of Sustainability\"[77] by launching a Student Office of Sustainability that now has over 25 affiliated student organizations.[78] In 2018, Pitt published its first comprehensive \"Pitt Sustainability Plan\",[79] established the Office of Sustainability,[80] and hired its first director of sustainability.[81][82] In 2020, Pitt committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2037 (its 250th anniversary)[83] and its first climate action plan came out in 2022.[84] Pitt received a AASHE STARS Gold rating in 2021,[85] building on its Silver rating from 2018,[86] has long been on The Princeton Review's \"Green Colleges\" list,[87] been included on the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Powered Universities list since 2018,[88][89] won multiple Sustainable Pittsburgh Challenges,[90] and has other third-party recognitions. In 2018, the university announced its intention to buy all of the electricity from a run-of-the-river hydro power facility to be built by Rye Development at Allegheny Lock and Dam No. 2 on the Allegheny River in 2023.[91] In 2020, the university announced a second local renewable power purchasing agreement, for solar power to be built on the border of Beaver and Allegheny counties near Pittsburgh International Airport.[92] The university has been criticized for some of its financial investments, namely those in the fossil fuel industry.[93][94] In 2020, a Board report disclosed that endowment exposure to fossil fuels had decreased 42% between 2015 and 2020, with zero private investments in fossil fuels by the end of 2035.[95] Organization and administration[edit] College/school founding College/school Year founded Arts and Sciences 1787 Business (graduate) 1960 Business (undergraduate) 1907 Dental Medicine 1896 Education 1910 Engineering 1846 General Studies 1932 Health & Rehabilitation Sciences 1969 Honors 1987 Computing and Information 2017 Law 1895 Medicine 1883 Nursing 1939 Pharmacy 1878 Public & International Affairs 1957 Public Health 1948 Social Work 1938 The university was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1787 and it operated as a fully private institution until an alteration to its charter in 1966 at which point it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. This conferred \"state-related\" status to the university making it a legal instrument of the Commonwealth which provides an annual financial appropriation, currently 7.7% of the university's total operating budget,[96] in exchange for the university offering tuition discounts to students who are residents of Pennsylvania. Legally, however, the university remains a private entity, operating under its nonprofit corporate charter, governed by its independent Board of Trustees, and with its assets under its own ownership and control. Therefore, it retains the freedom and individuality of a private institution, both administratively and academically, setting its own standards for admissions, awarding of degrees, faculty qualifications, teaching, and staff hiring.[c] The university's board of trustees maintains ultimate legal authority, governance, and responsibility for the university but specifically reserves authority over selecting the university's chancellor; approval of major policies, particularly those related to the fiduciary responsibilities of the board; and the definition of the university's mission and goals. It is made up of 36 voting members: chancellor, 17 term trustees elected by the board, 6 alumni trustees elected by the board on nomination from the Alumni Association Board of directors, and 12 Commonwealth trustees. The governor of Pennsylvania, the president pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, and the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives each appoints four of the 12 Commonwealth trustees. Additional non-voting trustees include 14 special trustees and additional emeritus trustees selected by the board. Non-voting ex-officio members include the governor of Pennsylvania, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the chief executive of Allegheny County, and the mayor of Pittsburgh. There are three or more regular meetings of the Board of Trustees per year.[100] The Board of Trustees selects the university's chancellor, who doubles as the chief academic officer and the chief executive of the university as well as serving as an ex officio voting member of the board of trustees. The chancellor is delegated with general administrative, academic, and management authority over the university. Under the chancellor are the provost and senior vice chancellor, the senior vice chancellor for health sciences, the deans of the various schools, the presidents of the regional campuses, department chairs, and the directors of university centers and institutes.[100] The university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.[3] Academics[edit] Throughout its history, Pitt has been committed to a liberal arts education with a curriculum in the arts, sciences, and humanities.[17] Pitt also has emphasized undergraduate research experience and opportunities such as co-ops and internships.[101] Undergraduate degrees can be earned as Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Philosophy. Along with providing certificate programs, graduate level master's, professional, and doctoral degrees are also awarded. Pitt has also initiated a university-wide Outside the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) that includes a structured series of extracurricular programs and experiences designed to complement students' academic studies and help develop personal attributes and professional skills.[102] Students who complete the OCC requirements receive an OCC \"transcript\" and a green cord of distinction to wear at commencement.[103] Pitt offers free workshops and certification programs such as a pedagogy certification badge[104] and a semester-long public education mentorship program.[105] Distinguished undergraduate programs are offered through the David C. Frederick Honors College.[106] The freshman level entry schools include the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business Administration, the Swanson School of Engineering, and the School of Nursing.

In the 2020–2021 academic year, 10 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.[110] Fall First-Time Freshman Statistics [111] [107] [112] [113] [114] [115] 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Applicants 53,072 34,656 32,549 32,091 29,857 27,679 Admits 26,079 23,109 20,791 18,180 17,696 16,528 Admit rate 49.1 66.7 63.9 56.7 59.3 59.7 Enrolled 4,390 4,875 4,230 4,026 4,126 4,019 Yield rate 16.8 21.1 20.3 22.1 23.3 24.3 ACT composite*(out of 36) 29–33 (16%†) 28–33(16%†) 28–32(33%†) 28–33(34%†) 28–33(41%†) 27–32(50%†) SAT composite*(out of 1600) 1280–1470 (49%†) 1250–1470(49%†) 1243–1420(81%†) 1260–1440(83%†) 1270–1430(81%†) 1240–1420(78%†) * middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit International studies[edit] The Indian Classroom, one of 31 Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning The university's historic emphasis on international studies is physically present in its collection of 31 Nationality Rooms on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning. Pitt is also one of the country's leading producers of both Fulbright scholars and Peace Corps volunteers,[66][116] and one of fewer than 20 American universities to claim five or more area studies programs that have been competitively designated as National Resource Centers by the U.S. Department of Education.[117] Pitt's National Resource Centers include Asian, European, Latin American, Russian and East European, and Global studies,[118] as well as Pitt's International Business Center.[117] In addition, Pitt's Asian Studies Center has been awarded status as a Confucius Institute by the Chinese Ministry of Education.[119][120] Further, Pitt is home to one of just ten European Union Centers of Excellence in the U.S., funded by the European Commission.[121] The University Center for International Studies (UCIS) coordinates international education curricula, centers on topical specializations in international studies, and the centers for area studies, including the National Resource Centers, among existing faculty and departments throughout the university. It does not confer degrees, but awards certificates of attainment to degree candidates in the university's schools and also operates certificate programs in African Studies (undergraduate) and in Global Studies (undergraduate & graduate).[122] UCIS also operates the Study Abroad Office,[123] Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs.[124] Pitt's study abroad program, under the auspices of UCIS, helps to facilitate student study in over a hundred different countries, and oversees a variety of programs including the Panther Programs, which are course taught abroad that have been developed and are accompanied by faculty of the university; two-way exchange agreements with foreign institutions; and Pitt-recognized, third-party exchange programs.[125] The university also offers several study abroad scholarships, including those through the Nationality Rooms program.[126] In addition, following the decision to end a 24-year sponsorship of the Semester at Sea program due to academic, administrative and safety concerns,[127] Pitt has created a Multi-region Academic Program (PittMAP) that involves international travel, accompanied by university faculty, to three different continents for the comparative study of one of six rotating global study themes.[128][129] Further, Pitt's Swanson School of Engineering has also established a joint engineering institute and program with Sichuan University in Chengdu,[130] and Pitt's School of Medicine has established an exchange program for biomedical research students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.[131] Rankings[edit] Academic rankingsNationalForbes[132]152U.S. News & World Report[133]70Washington Monthly[134]116WSJ/College Pulse[135]83GlobalARWU[136]90QS[137]222THE[138]141U.S. News & World Report[139]50 In its 2025 rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Pitt tied of 70th among national universities.[140] Princeton Review placed Pitt among its \"Best Value Public Colleges\",[141] while Kiplinger rated Pitt the best value in Pennsylvania and thirty-sixth best nationally for out-of-state students among public universities in their 2016 rankings.[142] The 2017 Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education college rankings of American universities ranked Pitt 75th overall, and the No. 1 public college in the Northeast.[143] In worldwide evaluations of universities, Newsweek ranked Pitt 37th in its \"The Top 100 Global Universities.\"[144] Pitt ranked 43rd worldwide in the 2017 Center for World University Rankings.[145] Pitt is also ranked 90th worldwide (and 42nd in the U.S.) in the 2018 Academic Ranking of World Universities.

An additional 5,353 full-time and part-time undergraduate students attend the university across the four regional campuses for a university-wide headcount of 33,744 total students, 24,553 of which are undergraduates. ^ Upon joining the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966, the University of Pittsburgh legally remained a private entity and in practice, retained the administrative and academic freedom of a private institution. It sets its own standards for student admission and retention, faculty, and teaching. Its assets remain in the hands of the corporation, its employees are employed by the corporation, and its affairs are governed by an independent Board of Trustees.[97] In-state tuition is subsidized by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the state provides approximately 11% of its operating budget.[98] The University of Pittsburgh is categorized as a public university in the Carnegie Foundation Classifications[7] and is typically listed as a public university in third party publications.[99] For simplicity, Pitt sometimes refers to itself a \"public university\". ^ Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say. ^ The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students. ^ The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.

It is at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, where the Ohio River is formed. Fort Pitt Museum is surrounded by Point State Park, a Pennsylvania state park named for the geographically and historically significant point that is between the rivers. This piece of land was key to controlling the upper reaches of the Ohio River Valley and western Pennsylvania, before, during and after the French and Indian War as well as the American Revolution. The museum is in a recreated bastion of Fort Pitt, which was originally built in 1758 by the British. An outline of Fort Duquesne is nearby. The historical focus of the museum is the role that Fort Pitt played during the French and Indian War. The museum also features detailed information on Fort Pitt's role during the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion and the founding of Pittsburgh. The museum was established and operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until its closure in August 2009 from state budget cuts. The Heinz Center took over the operation of the museum and reopened it in April 2010. History[edit] Main article: Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania) Fort Pitt was a fort in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The fort was built in 1758 during the French and Indian War, next to the site of Fort Duquesne. The French built Fort Duquesne at the beginning of that war, and it became a focal point due to its strategic river location. The Braddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at the Monongahela River. The French garrison viciously mauled an attacking British regiment in September 1758, but abandoned and destroyed the fort at the approach of General John Forbes's expedition in November. The Forbes expedition was successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of the Treaty of Easton, in which area American Indians agreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians— primarily Delawares and Shawnees— made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians wanted a trading post on the spot, but they did not want a British army garrison. The British, however, built a new fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder. \"A Plan of the New Fort at Pitts-Burgh\", drawn by cartographer John Rocque and published in 1765. \"Fort Pitt in 1795\", from Durant's 1876 \"History of Allegheny County\" The Blockhouse. Part of the excavated fort. As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part in Pontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, the commander of Fort Pitt gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox, in hopes of infecting the surrounding Indians and ending the siege. The effectiveness of this attempt is unclear. Outbreaks of smallpox had plagued Native Americans for years before, during and after the Fort Pitt attempt, killing much of the Native American population. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege in order to intercept an approaching force under Colonel Henry Bouquet, resulting in the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10. After Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for the western theatre of the war. Fort Pitt fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. It was abandoned in 1792 when Fort Fayette was built to replace it. Residents of the growing Pittsburgh used the remnants of the fort to build permanent housing for themselves. A small brick building called the Blockhouse—actually a type of outbuilding known as a redoubt—remains in Point State Park, the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764 and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh but in western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a home, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who make it open to the public. Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War, under the charge of William Metcalf. Museum[edit] Main article: Point State Park Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well underway. They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs. Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced. They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011.[2] These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different locals labour unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labour union protested the use of four non-labour workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park. [1] On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed.[3] The Senator John Heinz History Center reopened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District; Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, a two-floor museum-within-a-museum at the History Center.[4] Currently, the Fort Pitt Museum is open to visitation seven days a week from 10am - 5pm. The museum is closed only on major holidays (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving and Easter)[5] References[edit] Notes ^ \"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Pittsburgh Renaissance Historic District\" (PDF).

It is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River whose joining forms the Ohio River. The triangle is bounded by the two rivers. The area features offices for major corporations such as PNC Bank, U.S. Steel, PPG, Bank of New York Mellon, Heinz, Federated Investors, and Alcoa. It is where the fortunes of such industrial barons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Henry J. Heinz, Andrew Mellon and George Westinghouse were made. It contains the site where the French fort, Fort Duquesne, once stood.

An expanded definition of Downtown may include the adjacent neighborhoods of Uptown/The Bluff, the Strip District, the North Shore, and the South Shore. Transportation[edit] The Smithfield Street Bridge Famed mural on the 300 Sixth Street building Public transportation[edit] Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail subway system (known locally as the \"T\"), an extensive bus network, and two inclines (Duquesne Incline and Monongahela Incline). The Downtown portion of the subway has the following stations: T Stations Station Square on the South Shore in the Station Square development (street-level station) First Avenue near First Avenue & Ross Street, Downtown (elevated station) Steel Plaza at Sixth Avenue & Grant Street, Downtown (underground station) Penn Plaza near Liberty Avenue & Grant Street, Downtown (underground, limited service) Wood Street at the triangular intersection of Wood Street, Sixth Avenue, and Liberty Avenue, Downtown (underground station) Gateway Center at Liberty Avenue & Stanwix Street, Downtown (underground station) North Side near General Robinson Street & Tony Dorsett Drive on the North Shore (underground station) Allegheny near Allegheny Avenue & Reedsdale Street on the North Shore (elevated station) Downtown is also home to the Pittsburgh Amtrak train station connecting Pittsburgh with New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. to the east and Cleveland and Chicago to the west. Greyhound's Pittsburgh bus terminal is located across Liberty Avenue from the Amtrak Station, in the Grant Street Transportation Center building. Highways[edit] Major roadways serving Downtown from the suburbs include the \"Parkway East\" (I-376) from Monroeville, the \"Parkway West\" (I-376) from the airport area, and the \"Parkway North\" (I-279) from the North Hills, and (I-579) in Downtown Pittsburgh. Other important roadways are Pennsylvania Route 28, Pennsylvania Route 51, Pennsylvania Route 65, and U.S. Route 19. Three major entrances to the city are via tunnels: the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Squirrel Hill Tunnel on I-376 and the Liberty Tunnels. The New York Times once called Pittsburgh \"the only city with an entrance,\"[6] specifically referring to the view of Downtown that explodes upon drivers immediately upon exiting the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Also traveling I-279 south and I-376, the city \"explodes into view\" when coming around a turn in the highway. Local streets[edit] Wood Street Downtown surface streets are based on two distinct grid systems that parallel the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.[7] These two grids intersect along Liberty Avenue, creating many unusual street intersections. Furthermore, the Allegheny grid contains numbered streets, while the Monongahela grid contains numbered avenues. And, in fact, there are cases where these numbered roadways intersect, creating some confusion (i.e. the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 7th Street/6th Avenue). This unusual grid pattern leads to Pittsburghers giving directions in the terms of landmarks, rather than turn-by-turn directions.[7] Bridges[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh Bridges Aerial photo of Downtown Pittsburgh and all of the connecting bridges in 2019 Pittsburgh is nicknamed \"The City of Bridges\". In Downtown, there are 10 bridges (listed below) connecting to points north and south. The expanded definition of Downtown (including the aforementioned surrounding neighborhoods) includes 18 bridges. Citywide there are 446 bridges. In Allegheny County the number exceeds 2,200. Downtown Bridges Sixth Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh Fort Pitt Bridge carries I-376 (Previously I-279) between Downtown and the Fort Pitt Tunnel Fort Duquesne Bridge carries I-279 between Downtown and the North Shore Smithfield Street Bridge carries Smithfield Street between Downtown and the South Shore Panhandle Bridge carries the city's light rail transit system between Downtown and the South Shore Liberty Bridge connects the Liberty Tunnel to I-579 Downtown Roberto Clemente Bridge (formerly 6th St Bridge) connects 6th Street Downtown to Federal Street on the North Shore at PNC Park Andy Warhol Bridge (formerly 7th St Bridge) connects 7th Street Downtown to Sandusky Street on the North Shore at the Andy Warhol Museum Rachel Carson Bridge (formerly 9th St Bridge) connects 9th Street Downtown to Anderson Street on the North Shore Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge carries freight and Amtrak trains from Downtown to the North Shore Veterans Bridge carries I-579 from Downtown to the North Side Bridges of Expanded Downtown West End Bridge carries US Route 19 from the West End/South Shore to the North Shore/North Side just west of Downtown 16th Street Bridge carries 16th Street from the Strip District to Chestnut Street on the North Side West Penn Bridge (pedestrian/bike-only) is part of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail connecting the North Side to Washington's Landing on Herr's Island 30th Street Bridge connects River Avenue on the North Side with Waterfront Drive on Washington's Landing at Herr's Island 31st Street Bridge connects PA Route 28 on the North Side with 31st Street in the Strip District 33rd Street Railroad Bridge connects the North Side to the Strip District and crosses Herr's Island South 10th Street Bridge connects the Armstrong Tunnel at Second Avenue just east of Downtown with the South Side at South 10th Street Birmingham Bridge connects East Carson Street on the South Side with Fifth and Forbes avenues in Uptown Downtown districts[edit] Downtown contains a wealth of historic, cultural, and entertainment sites. While most people still consider the entire Downtown as one neighborhood, there are several significant subdistricts within the Golden Triangle. The Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District is a historic district in the central business district. It is bounded by Wood Street, Forbes Avenue, Grant Street, and Liberty Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 17, 1985.[8] Point State Park area: At the triangle's tip is Point State Park with its giant fountain and the Fort Pitt Museum. This park was the original site of both Fort Duquesne by the French and the subsequent Fort Pitt by the British. The Cultural District along Penn and Liberty avenues on the Allegheny River includes numerous theaters, galleries, and concert halls including Heinz Hall, Byham Theater, O'Reilly Theater, Benedum Center, and Wood Street Galleries as well as restaurants and housing. The Penn-Liberty Historic District encompasses the Penn & Liberty avenue corridor in the Cultural District. The Fifth & Forbes Corridor is Downtown's shopping district along Fifth and Forbes avenues and includes historic Market Square. Downtown is home to numerous independent retailers plus large retailers such as Burlington Coat Factory and Brooks Brothers. The Grant Street area is the seat of Pittsburgh's and Allegheny County's government and is also a prestigious corporate address with many of the city's tallest skyscrapers. The Firstside neighborhood along the Boulevard of the Allies and Fort Pitt Boulevard adjacent to the Monongahela River is an educational and residential district. It is home to Point Park University and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh both of which have high-rise student housing in the neighborhood. Numerous other residential projects are also under construction in this neighborhood. Economy[edit] Pittsburgh's number of jobs is generally stable. Downtown Pittsburgh retains substantial economic influence, ranking at 25th in the nation for jobs within the urban core and 6th in job density.[9] University of Pittsburgh economist Christopher Briem notes that the level of employment in the city has remained largely constant for the past 50 years: \"[the] time series of jobs located in the City proper are about as stable as any economic metric in the region, or in any other Northeastern US urban core, over many decades. In 1958, [there were] 294,000 jobs located in the city proper...Those numbers are virtually identical today which tells me there is a certain limit to how many jobs can efficiently be located in what are some relatively (very) constrained areas.\"[10][better source needed] These numbers reflect employment in the city as a whole, not just the central business district; but the central business district has the highest density of employment of any Pittsburgh neighborhood. Pittsburgh has long been a headquarters city, with numerous national and global corporations calling the Golden Triangle home. Currently, Downtown is still home to a large number of Fortune 500 companies (7 in the metro area, 5 of which are in the city in 2022, which ranks Pittsburgh high nationally in Fortune 500 headquarters): Kraft Heinz – co-headquartered in PPG Place PNC Financial Services – headquartered in the Tower at PNC Plaza PPG Industries – headquartered in PPG Place WESCO International – headquartered at Station Square U.S. Steel – headquartered at the US Steel Tower Downtown is also home to GNC, Dollar Bank, Equitable Resources, Duquesne Light, Federated Investors and Highmark as well as the regional headquarters for Citizens Bank, Ariba, and Dominion Resources. Regional healthcare giant UPMC has its corporate headquarters in the US Steel Tower. Major buildings[edit] See also: List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh The sweeping roofline of the David L.

Lowery, Executive DirectorWebsitewww.phmc.state.pa.us The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) is the governmental agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, responsible for the collection, conservation, and interpretation of Pennsylvania's heritage. The commission cares for historical manuscripts, public records, and objects of historical interest; museums; archeology; publications; historic sites and properties; historic preservation; geographic names; and the promotion of public interest in Pennsylvania history.[1] PHMC was established on June 6, 1945, by state Act No. 446, merging the Pennsylvania Historical Commission (PHC), The State Museum of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania State Archives.[2][3] Historical marker program[edit] Main article: List of Pennsylvania state historical markers The PHMC administers the Historical Marker Program, which, when it began in 1914, installed metal plaques onto large rocks and boulders to commemorate individuals, events, and landmarks throughout the state. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission, the predecessor to the PHMC, launched the program. The markers were redesigned in 1945–46 to make them easier to read from a passing car. Large cast aluminum markers were mounted on poles along a street or road, close to where a landmark was located, a person lived or worked, or an event occurred. By 2020, more than 2,000 markers were in place and were being maintained by the PHMC. The PHMC has posted criteria for inclusion for new markers and accepts marker proposals from the public.[4] Pennsylvania Heritage magazine[edit] PHMC also publishes Pennsylvania Heritage magazine[5] in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Heritage Foundation.

Barker, PhDCuratorDawn R. BreanArchitectFrederick J. OsterlingNearest parkingOn site and streetWebsitethefrickpittsburgh.org The Frick Pittsburgh is a cluster of museums and historical buildings located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, and formed around the Frick family's nineteenth-century residence known as \"Clayton\". It focuses on the interpretation of the life and times of Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919), industrialist and art collector. The complex, located on 5.5 acres (22,000 m2)[1] of lawn and gardens in the city's Point Breeze neighborhood, includes Clayton, the restored Frick mansion; The Frick Art Museum; The Car and Carriage Museum; the Greenhouse; the Frick children's playhouse; and The Café. The site welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Admission is free. Helen Clay Frick (1888–1984) was the driving force to preserve the Frick estate and allow it to open to the public after her death. History[edit] The Frick Mansion \"Clayton\" Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881. The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown. After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed \"Clayton\". Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architect Frederick J. Osterling. The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architects Alden & Harlow. The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905. The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established the Frick Collection, but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum.[citation needed] In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013.[1][2] The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.[3] Collections[edit] Cars in The Frick's car and carriage museum.The Frick Art Museum's collection includes a large group of works on paper by Jean-François Millet, Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, and nineteenth-century European paintings. There are also Late Medieval and Renaissance paintings of a devotional nature by: Bernardo Daddi, Lippo Memmi, Giovanni di Paolo, Francesco di Vannuccio (\"Saint Catherine\"), Rainaldo di Rainuccio da Spoleto, Sassetta, Matteo Di Giovanni, Francesco Melzi, and Jean Bellegambe. In the Frick Art Museum, there are Renaissance and Baroque paintings with secular themes by: Apollonio Di Giovanni (\"Scenes from Homer's Odyssey\"), Jean-Louis de Marne (\"Seine at Saint Cloud\"), Carle Van Loo, Maurice Quentin de la Tour, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Steen, Jan van Os, and Arthur Devis. In Clayton, in the mansion Frick lived in are 19th Century paintings by Jules Cazin, Jean-François Raffaëlli, and Anton Mauve.[original research?] Automobiles on display include an 1881 Brougham, 1898 Panhard et Levassor Tonneau, 1903 Baker Electric, 1906 Outing Wagon, 1909 Bailey Electric Phaeton, 1909 Keystone Sixty-Six Roadster, 1911 Penn 30 Touring Car, 1912 Daimler Landaulet, 1914 Ford Model T Touring Car, 1914 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Touring Car, 1917 Standard Model E Touring Car, 1924 Auto Red Bug Flyer, 1931 Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton, and 1940 American Bantam Convertible Coupe.[original research?] The museum hosts numerous exhibitions.

The community was named after a tavern once located there.[3] Like nearby Squirrel Hill, it contains a large Jewish population, but is still majority Catholic and contributes to a high percentage of students enrolled in Taylor Allderdice High School, Oakland Catholic High School, and Central Catholic High School. The most prominent feature of Point Breeze is Henry Clay Frick's Clayton, which is a part of the 5.5-acre (2.2 ha)[4] Frick Art & Historical Center. Nearby is St. Bede School, a Catholic school, and the Pittsburgh New Church School. It is also the home to two Pittsburgh Public Schools, Linden Academy elementary school and Sterrett Middle School, and the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary. The neighborhood also hosts much open space, with Westinghouse Park, Mellon Park, the scenic Homewood Cemetery, as well as the northern edge of Frick Park within its borders. Pulitzer Prize winner Annie Dillard's popular memoir, An American Childhood, is set in Point Breeze during the 1950s. As a child she attended Park Place Elementary. Both of John Edgar Wideman's memoirs, Brothers and Keepers and Hoop Roots, use North Point Breeze's Westinghouse Park as a setting, as well as in his fictional Homewood Trilogy. Although officially distinct neighborhoods separated by Penn Avenue, \"Point Breeze\" is also frequently taken to include North Point Breeze.[citation needed] Surrounding neighborhoods[edit] Point Breeze has six borders, five with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Point Breeze to the north, Regent Square to the southeast, Squirrel Hill South to the south and southwest, Squirrel Hill North to the west, and Shadyside to the northwest. The other border is with the borough of Wilkinsburg to the east. Point Breeze also runs catty-corner (without a direct border) with the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Larimer to the north at the intersection of Penn and Fifth Avenues (This intersection also serves as an east–west \"diagonal\" for the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and North Point Breeze). Park Place[edit] The eastern edge of the neighborhood, north of Regent Square and east of Frick Park, comprises the neighborhood of Park Place.[5] The Shady Side Academy Junior School sits here, as does Environmental Charter School, a Pittsburgh Public School that operates as a charter school in the building originally known as Park Place School. Notable residents[edit] Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 – September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller. David McCullough (July 7, 1933 – August 7, 2022), noted historian and author, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was born and raised in Point Breeze.[6] See also[edit] List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods Gallery[edit] The Frick Art Museum, part of the Frick Art & Historical Center at \"Clayton\".

Named after U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) from Pennsylvania, it is located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. The Heinz History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2)[2] educational institution \"that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection.\"[3] In 2024, the Heinz History Center was named the best history museum in the United States by readers of USA Today as part of their annual Readers' Choice poll.[4] Senator John Heinz History Center[edit] The Heinz History Center seen from the Strip District in Pittsburgh in July 2007 In 1879, a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania was founded. In 1884, leaders changed the organization's name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (HSWP); it has been operating continuously since then and is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization.[3] HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955, it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. During its early years, HSWP leaders held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, were granted space for the organization's archives at the new Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood.[3] By 1914, HSWP had its own building on Bigelow Boulevard. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District.[3] The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by hosting an inaugural gala there on April 26, 1996, for 900 guests.[citation needed] In 2004, the Smithsonian wing was completed, adding a gallery for changing exhibitions from the Smithsonian Institution, a Special Collections Gallery, an Education Center, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum.[5] The History Center is named for John Heinz, a former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash.[2] Architecture[edit] The century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right.[6] Interior and contents[edit] The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Detre Library & Archives, and six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania.[7] The History Center features permanent exhibitions including: Pittsburgh: A Tradition of Innovation - celebrates 250 years of Western Pennsylvania's significant contributions to the world, from Dr. Jonas Salk's discovery of the polio vaccine to the invention of the Big Mac.[8] Senator John Heinz: A Western Pennsylvania Legacy - details the life and legacy of one of Pittsburgh's most beloved philanthropists and politicians.[9] Clash of Empires: The British, French, & Indian War, 1754-1763 - explores the origins, development, and aftermath of the global French and Indian War.[10] From Slavery to Freedom - explores more than 250 years of African American history, from 18th century Africa to 21st century Western Pennsylvania.[11] Rediscovering Lewis & Clark: A Journey with the Rooney Family - traces the path of Lewis and Clark's expedition beginning in Pittsburgh.[12] Glass: Shattering Notions - showcases Pittsburgh's reign as America's \"glass city\" and the history of the region’s first industry.[13] Heinz - chronicles the history of the H.J. Heinz Company.[14] Visible Storage - provides a behind-the-scenes look at more than 1,200 objects in the museum's collection.[15] Special Collections Gallery - houses artifacts illustrating the rich ethnic history and corporate fabric of the Pittsburgh region.[16] The gallery also features original set pieces and props from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which was filmed in Pittsburgh.[17] Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the History Center[edit] Located in the Smithsonian wing of the Senator John Heinz History Center, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum spans 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of exhibit space over two floors. The \"museum within a museum\" captures the Pittsburgh region's evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs. Select artifacts include Franco Harris' \"Immaculate Reception\" cleats; Mario Lemieux's hockey skates; Satchel Paige's baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 World Series; Billy Conn's boxing gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; Arnold Palmer's sweater and golf bag; Chip Ganassi's 2000 Indy 500-winning race car; the \"Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;\" the Homestead women swimmers Olympic medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cards. Detre Library & Archives at the History Center[edit] The History Center's Detre Library & Archives is an extensive scholarly resource documenting 250 years of life in Western Pennsylvania. The collection includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, atlases, newspapers, films, recordings, and other memorabilia.[18] Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village[edit] Main article: Meadowcroft Rockshelter The History Center also operates Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a world-renowned archaeological site south of Pittsburgh near Washington County's Avella community. The Rockshelter is the oldest site of human habitation in North America, with evidence of humans living there for nearly 19,000 years.[19] The site was named a National Historic Landmark in 2005.[20] The site also includes a recreated 16th century Monongahela Indian Village and 1770s Frontier Trading Post.[21] Adjacent to the Rockshelter is a historic village featuring 19th century structures relocated to the site. The History Center operates this as a living museum, with re-enactors recreating rural life in the 19th century Upper Ohio Valley.[22] Fort Pitt Museum[edit] Main article: Fort Pitt Museum Since 2010, the History Center has operated the Fort Pitt Museum, a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) museum located at Point State Park.[23][24] The museum tells the story of Western Pennsylvania’s pivotal role during the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh.[24] References[edit] ^ \"About\".

It is a one-half square mile area of land northeast of the central business district bordered to the north by the Allegheny River and to the south by portions of the Hill District. The Strip District runs between 11th and 33rd Streets and includes four main thoroughfares—Railroad Street/Waterfront Place, Smallman Street, Penn Avenue, and Liberty Avenue—as well as various side streets. A warehouse district that was once home to many mills and factories, today the Strip District is a destination for groceries, restaurants, bars, and art. Recently, it has become home to dozens of tech and robotics companies as well as a rapidly growing residential population.[3] History[edit] In the early 19th century, the Strip District was home to many mills and factories as its location along the Allegheny River made for easy transportation of goods and shipping of raw materials. It was the home of the Fort Pitt Foundry, source of large cannons before and during the American Civil War, including a 20-inch (510 mm) bore Rodman Gun.[4] Early industrial tenants of the Strip District included U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, The Pittsburgh Reduction Company (ALCOA), and later The H.J. Heinz Company, famous ketchup and condiment manufacturer. The shipping infrastructure built around the manufacturing companies attracted other types of merchants to set up shop in the Strip. By the early 20th century, the Strip District became a vibrant network of wholesalers—mostly fresh produce, meat, and poultry dealers. Soon, auction houses rose around the wholesale warehouses. Many restaurants and grocery stores opened to feed hungry shift workers at any hour of the day. By the 1920s, the Strip District was the economic center of Pittsburgh. By the mid-to-late 20th century, fewer of the Strip's products were being shipped by rail and boat, causing many produce sellers and wholesalers to leave the area for other space with easier access to highways, or where there was more land available for expansion. In the early 21st century, there are still several wholesalers and produce dealers in the Strip District, but some estimates say more than 80% of the produce industry left the area, preceded by the manufacturing plants and mills in the mid to late 20th century restructuring of industry. Today, many of the abandoned warehouses have been renovated as small specialty shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The historic St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, an 1891 landmark built in the ornate Polish Cathedral style, lies in the heart of the Strip District and served early generations of Polish immigrants. Today[edit] Since the late 20th century, the area has developed into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton. The lack of weekday activity is in someways compensated by retail and leisure facilities which are used primarily on weekends. Particularly in the summer months, there are open-air farmers' markets, a range of street vendors and facilities to enjoy open air drinks. Residential developers have begun to convert old factory and warehouse buildings into apartments and lofts. Examples include the Armstrong Cork Factory, Brake House Lofts, and the Otto Milk Building. The area is the long-time home of the renowned Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. More recently, the area has attracted a number of technology companies and become a hotbed for autonomous vehicle and robotics technology. The area is home to Uber's Advanced Technology Group, which leads the company's vehicular automation efforts, as well Argo AI and Aurora Innovation.[5] Other technology companies with offices in the Strip District include Apple, Facebook, Denso, Robert Bosch GmbH, Target Corporation, Wombat Security, JazzHR, Petuum, and BossaNova Robotics.[6][7] Pittsburgh's Strip District on February 5, 2024. Photo by Steven Adams Surrounding and adjacent Pittsburgh neighborhoods[edit] The Strip District has five land borders, including Downtown to the southwest, Crawford-Roberts, Bedford Dwellings and Polish Hill to the south, and Lower Lawrenceville to the northeast. Across the Allegheny River, the Strip runs adjacent with the North Shore and Troy Hill with direct links to both neighborhoods via 16th Street and 31st Street Bridges, respectively.

If accurately dated, it would be one of the earliest known sites with evidence of a human presence and continuous human occupation in the New World.[2] The site is located twenty-seven miles west-southwest of Pittsburgh[5] in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The site operates as a division of the Heinz History Center of Pittsburgh and has a museum and a reconstruction of a circa 1570s Monongahela culture Indian village. Meadowcroft Rockshelter is recognized as a National Historic Landmark, a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Treasure, and as an official project of Save America's Treasures. Geology and location[edit] The rockshelter is a natural formation beneath an overhanging cliff of Morgantown-Connellsville sandstone, which is a thick Pennsylvanian-age sandstone, brown in color. Meadowcroft is in the Allegheny Plateau, northwest of the Appalachian Basin.[6] Archaeology[edit] Meadowcroft Rockshelter and other Native American points of interest in Southwestern Pennsylvania Excavations[edit] Native Americans left the site during the American Revolutionary War. It was not rediscovered until many years later, when, in 1955, Albert Miller found the first artifacts in a groundhog burrow. Miller delayed reporting his findings so as to not attract vandals, until he contacted James M. Adovasio, who led the first excavations of the site in 1973 until 1979 by the Cultural Resource Management Program of the University of Pittsburgh. Further University of Pittsburgh field school excavations were conducted through 1989.[7][8] Since the 1990s, more recent work has also been undertaken by Adovasio through the Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute.[9] The methods of excavation used at Meadowcroft are still seen as state-of-the-art. It is viewed as one of the most carefully excavated sites in North America.[10] Finds[edit] Inside the shelter Meadowcroft has produced what may be pre-Clovis remains, found as deep as 11.5 feet underground. The site also has yielded many tools, including pottery, bifaces, bifacial fragments, lamellar blades, a lanceolate projectile point, and chipping debris. Recoveries of note also include fluted points, which are a marker of the Paleoindian period. Remains of flint from Ohio, jasper from eastern Pennsylvania and marine shells from the Atlantic coast suggest that the people inhabiting the area were mobile and involved in long-distance trade. At least one basin-shaped hearth was reused over time. Meadowcroft has also yielded the largest collection of flora and fauna materials ever recovered from a location in eastern North America.[11] The arid environment provided the necessary and rare conditions that permitted excellent botanical preservation. In total, animal remains representing 149 species were excavated. Evidence shows that people gathered smaller game animals as well as plants, such as corn, squash, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Dating[edit] Radiocarbon dating of the site indicated occupancy beginning 16,000 years ago (14,000 BCE) and possibly as early as 19,000 years ago (17,000 BCE). However, the dates are still controversial. A recent (2013) survey carried out by the Society for American Archaeology reported support from 38% of archaeologists, with 20% rejecting the early dates.[12] Criticism of these early radiocarbon dates has focused on the potential for contamination by ancient carbon from coal-bearing strata in the watershed.[13] The samples, tested by an independent third party geomorphologist, concluded that the samples showed no evidence of groundwater activity. Tests performed via accelerator mass spectrometry also support the earlier dates.[14] Proponents of the notion that contamination occurred note that the alkali-soluble humates in charcoal samples from the site are older than the charcoal in the samples.[15] If authentic, these dates would indicate that Meadowcroft was used in the pre-Clovis era and, as such, provides evidence for very early human habitation of the Americas.[16][17] Meadowcroft Rockshelter may be one of the oldest known sites of human habitation in North America, providing a unique glimpse into the lives of prehistoric hunters and gatherers. Paleoindian, Archaic, and Woodland remains have all been found at the site. Miller complex[edit] An unusual type of arrowhead was found at the site, which has been named the Miller Lanceolate projectile point. Similar unfluted lanceolate points have also been found at the adjacent sites. As Goodyear writes:Enough lithic artifacts were recovered to define the Miller complex. This complex consists of thin bifaces, including one lanceolate point, the Miller Lanceolate; small prismatic blades; retouched flake tools and blades, and debitage related to late-stage core and biface reduction and tool kit maintenance.[18]The Miller complex is further defined by surveys done in the Cross Creek watershed, where other lanceolate points, small prismatic blades, and small polyhedral blade cores have been recovered. According to Adovasio et al.,[19] this complex has a Eurasiatic and Siberian appearance. These authors also note that small blades and polyhedral cores are absent from subsequent Paleoindian fluted-point assemblages in this region, reinforcing the technological distinctiveness of the Miller complex.[18] The adjacent Krajacic Site is located about ten miles southeast of Meadowcroft, and it is also important in defining the Miller complex. This site yielded a great variety of distinctive Meadowcroft-style blade implements and several small, cylindrical polyhedral cores.[20][21] At Cactus Hill in Virginia, similar points have been found, where they are dubbed as the Early Triangular type. Some similar finds were made at the Page-Ladson site in Florida as well.[22][23] Because of the very long occupational sequence at Meadowcroft, it became a very important site and is seen as quite valuable for comparative analysis: The Pre-Clovis artifacts from Meadowcroft Rockshelter include a lanceolate point (named the Miller Lanceolate), bifaces, unifaces, prismatic blades, core fragments, and debitage. Remains from other Pre-Clovis sites (e.g., Cactus Hill and Saltville, Virginia, Topper, South Carolina, etc.) are usually compared to the Meadowcroft assemblage.[24] In addition, claims for Pre-Clovis inhabitants in other sections of the New World also are evaluated with Meadowcroft in mind.[25][22] According to some scholars, Clovis, Folsom, and other fluted point complexes may have derived from such unfluted lanceolate points.[22] Other relevant sites in the northeastern United States[edit] See also: Alternatives to the Clovis First theory Other sites in the northeastern United States with evidence of possible pre-Clovis human presence include: Burning Tree Mastodon (Ohio), Mitchell Farm (Delaware), Barton (Barton Village Site, Maryland), Miles Point, and Parsons Island.[26] Tourism and historical designations[edit] Renovations to the rock shelter in 2008 were made so that visitors can see some of the tools and campfires made by the first Americans thousands of years ago. The rockshelter is recognized as a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Treasure and is an official project of Save America's Treasures. The historic site also includes a recreation of a 16th-century Monongahela village as well as 18th and 19th century buildings from European and United States settlement.[27] The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In 1999, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the site.[2] It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.[3] It is also designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation.[28] See also[edit] Chiquihuite cave List of Native American archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania List of National Historic Landmarks in Pennsylvania References[edit] ^ \"National Register Information System\".

Founded in 1794, it houses one of the largest theological libraries in the tri-state area. History[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s Western Theological Seminary and the United Presbyterian Church of North America's Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. The consolidation was the result of the 1958 merger between the PCUSA and the UPCNA to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary began with the founding of Service Seminary (Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service, Beaver County, Pennsylvania) in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania. Prior to that time, the Presbytery was dependent on a supply of ministers sent from Scotland. John Anderson was elected as the first teacher of divinity and the school began with an enrollment of six students. Service Seminary moved several times, from Service to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, then to Xenia, Ohio, where it became Xenia Theological Seminary. This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in the Midwest. Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 (leaving 4th United Presbyterian Church in Allegheny, Pennsylvania). In approximately 1914, Kyle was appointed president. In 1920, the trustees determined to move the seminary to St. Louis, Missouri, also to be nearer to potential students in the Plains states. In 1921, Kyle died unexpectedly. This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root. In 1930, Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825, which was known as Pittsburgh Seminary (1825–1833; 1913–1930) and Allegheny Seminary (1833–1912).[1] Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. This institution was later augmented by the resources of Newburgh Seminary, founded in New York City in 1805 by John Mitchell Mason. Western Theological Seminary, the other branch of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's pre-1959 history, began with the establishment of classical academies in Washington, Pennsylvania, the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan. Out of these academies, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary. It was indeed a western seminary in 1825, furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River.[2] Since the 1959 consolidation, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has been located on the former Pittsburgh-Xenia Seminary campus in the Highland Park/East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. It became a PC (USA) seminary following the 1983 merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Academics[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The seminary has scholars in all major fields of theological inquiry and offers language training in Greek and Hebrew. The following degrees are offered by the institution:[3] Master of Divinity (M.Div.) Master of Arts in Pastoral Studies (M.A.P.S.) Master of Theological Studies (MTS) Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) Focus areas include Science and Theology, Missional Leadership, Reformed, Christian Spirituality, Intergenerational Black Church Studies, Eastern Christian, and Creative Writing & Public Theology.[4] The Seminary also cooperates with other institutions within the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education to offer joint degree programs, including: Master of Divinity/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) M.A.P.S./Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) MTS/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) Master of Divinity/Master of Social Work (University of Pittsburgh) Clifford E. Barbour Library[edit] The Clifford E. Barbour Library[5] is a theological library in Western Pennsylvania. Its 300,000 volumes, several online databases, and more than 800 periodical subscriptions make it one of the larger stand-alone theological libraries in the United States.[6] The library is located in a three-story building of American Colonial design, dedicated in 1964. The library houses several valuable collections, including the John M. Mason Memorial Collection, which consists of many rare theological works dating from the Reformation. On display in the Hansen Reading Room are the desk and chair of Karl Barth, dedicated to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary by Barth's son, Markus Barth, a faculty member from 1963–1972.[7] Many of the books and periodicals in the collection were made possible by a $15 million gift from wealthy banker and businessman Thomas Clinton. The library was managed by Dikran Hadidian during its formative years. Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is home to the Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The museum contains a collection of ancient Near Eastern and Palestinian pottery and artifacts brought together by travelers and archeologists over the past 60 years. Many exhibits resulted from the eight excavations of which the seminary has been a part. The Seminary is very involved in Biblical archaeology, and sponsors the Zeitah Excavations in Israel at Tel Zayit.[8] The excavation was founded under the direction of Professor Ron E. Tappy, Professor of Bible and Archaeology and director of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The excavation began in 1999 with a 55-member international team of experts and volunteers. In July 2005 excavators discovered the Zayit Stone, which contained an inscription dating to the 10th century BCE (King Solomon's reign). The two-line inscription, on a 33-pound limestone boulder embedded in the stone wall of a building, is the earliest securely-dated example of the complete Hebrew alphabet (an \"abecedary\"). The letters show a transitional script emerging from Phoenician and leading to the Hebrew national script of the 9th century BCE. The first significant inscription from this period in nearly a century, the discovery was reported in the New York Times. World Mission Initiative[edit] World Mission Initiative (WMI) at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is a fellowship of Presbyterians.[9] WMI prepares seminarians to become pastors, and coordinates cross-cultural trips. It has a church focus and works to train world Christian pastors. WMI hosts missionaries, national church leaders, and scholars on campus throughout the year. Faculty and alumni[edit] Prominent faculty from the seminary's history include: Dale Allison M. Craig Barnes Robert A. J. Gagnon John Gerstner Archibald Alexander Hodge William Swan Plumer Andrew Purves Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield Robert Dick Wilson Prominent alumni include: Thomas K. Chadwick John A. Dalles Festo Kivengere, sometimes referred to as \"the Billy Graham of Africa\", a Ugandan Anglican Bishop of Kigezi, evangelist, and fierce critic of Idi Amin's excesses.

It is bordered by Highland Park, Morningside, Stanton Heights, Garfield, Friendship, Shadyside and Larimer, and falls largely within Pittsburgh City Council District 9, with a few areas in District 8. One of the most notable features in the East Liberty skyline is the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, which is an area landmark. Beginnings[edit] Around the time of the American Revolution, East Liberty was a free grazing area in Allegheny County located a few miles east of the young, growing town called Pittsburgh. (In older English usage, a \"liberty\" was a plot of common land on the outskirts of a town.) Two farming patriarchs owned much of the nearby land, and their descendants' names grace streets in and around East Liberty today. John Conrad Winebiddle owned land west of present-day East Liberty, in what are now Bloomfield, Garfield, and Friendship, and his daughter Barbara inherited a portion close to what is now East Liberty. Alexander Negley owned a farm called \"Fertile Bottom\" north of present-day East Liberty along the southern bank of the Allegheny River. Negley's land included some of present-day East Liberty and much of nearby Highland Park, Morningside, Larimer, and Stanton Heights. Alexander Negley's son Jacob married Barbara Winebiddle, built a manor house, and developed a village that he called East Liberty after the old grazing commons. In 1816, Negley saw to it that the Pittsburgh-Greensburg turnpike was built through East Liberty, which made the area a trading center and ensured its future growth. Growth[edit] East Liberty truly began to develop as a commercial area in 1843, when Jacob's daughter Sarah Jane Negley married the ambitious lawyer Thomas Mellon. Mellon had first visited the area of modern-day East Liberty in 1823, when as a 10-year-old he saw the Negley mansion for the first time and decided he wanted something like it. He achieved this goal and much more: after first becoming a prosperous lawyer, he made his true fortune by marrying Sarah Jane Negley, selling or renting the land near East Liberty that she inherited, and using the proceeds to finance Pittsburgh's nascent industries. Like Jacob Negley before him, Thomas Mellon worked to make East Liberty a transportation hub: Mellon convinced some of Pittsburgh's first trolley lines to pass through East Liberty. East Liberty developed more or less independently of Pittsburgh until the Pennsylvania Railroad opened the East Liberty station in the 1850s. This passenger depot served to connect East Liberty to the city; twenty-six trains transported people to and from downtown on a daily basis.[3] The rail connection was of crucial importance for the area's future development, because Pittsburgh was just about to enter its industrial boom period that would last between the end of the Civil War and World War I. As the city's population swelled to fuel the burgeoning iron and steel industry, East Liberty grew too. The neighborhood's population increased from under 1,000 in 1850 to over 46,000 by 1910.[4] East Liberty acted as a first-ring residential suburb for elite families looking to escape the industrial smoke and soot of the city. By the turn of the century, it was one of the richest suburbs in America, containing many of the wealthy industrialists’ mansions.[5] However, East Liberty was not exclusively an elite, Anglo-American neighborhood. The East Liberty Station brought floods of European immigrants and African American migrants from the South, who were drawn by Pittsburgh's manufacturing and industrial jobs. The neighborhood became home to an impressive number of churches for various religions and ethnicities by the late nineteenth century. There were separate places of worship for German and Italian Protestants, Irish, Italian and German Catholics, as well as a Presbyterian church for Anglo-Americans and an AME church for African Americans.[6] East Liberty's diverse mix of Italian, Anglo-American, German, African-American, Jewish, Polish, Greek, and Irish residents stayed intact until after World War II. On June 30, 1868, the City of Pittsburgh annexed Collins and Liberty townships, which together included East Liberty. Thanks to its favorable location and Mellon's guiding hand, East Liberty became a thriving commercial center in the following years. East Liberty's merchants served many of Pittsburgh's industrial millionaires, who settled in nearby Shadyside and Point Breeze. Professionals in Highland Park and Friendship and laborers in Bloomfield and Garfield also shopped in East Liberty. There were four movie theaters. Actor-singer Dick Powell got his start singing at the Enright Theater. By 1950, the area was a bustling and fully urban marketplace, anchored by Sears-Roebuck store on Highland Avenue and (Albert J )Mansmann's Department Store on Penn Avenue. It had become the largest, in terms of sales dollars, non-center-city business district in the country. Decline[edit] East Liberty's decline was precipitated by a series of government policies relating to the underwriting of mortgages for homes commonly referred to as redlining. The residential areas immediately surrounding East Liberty's main business district consisted primarily of tightly packed wood frame homes built in the mid-to-late 1800s..[7] In 1937, The George F Cram Company undertook the creation of federally sponsored surveys and maps which ultimately became the 'redlined' maps used by banks for underwriting. The Cram Maps listed this housing stock as \"obsolete,\" noted the \"infiltration of Jews... and Negroes\", and the large number of people on relief (the New Deal version of Welfare) as justification for redlining the area.[8] The result of this redlining was two-fold; first, it made accessing conventional forms of credit for home purchases and renovations difficult; and second, it fostered segregation of low income minorities in a neighborhood that was clearly racially diverse in 1937.[9][10] Because most real estate is purchased with a mortgage, and banks would not lend against properties in redlined areas, most prospective buyers could not buy homes in the area at competitive prices, causing an artificial collapse of demand and property value. Without capital to fund repairs and renovations, homes in poor repair deteriorated over time.[8] Indeed, when urban renewal's blight remediation via demolition was undertaken in the 1960s, the areas redlined in 1937 were those designated as blighted, and razed. The residential neighborhoods north of the redlined areas were not immune to the impact of redlining. The larger brick four-square homes built in the first 20 years of the 20th Century were interspersed with the estates of Pittsburgh's wealthy.[11] However, the George F. Cram surveys noted \"...negro encroachment threatening], calling it an obsolete, \"...mediocre section of East Liberty.\"], and designated it as a higher risk for lenders.[12] Though this area of the neighborhood declined in tandem with the greater East Liberty neighborhood, it was spared the greater destruction of Urban Renewal. Two decisions in the 1960s exacerbated the trends begun with redlining. The first was an attempt to halt a slow trickle of businesses from the City to the suburbs. In the early 1960s, a few of East Liberty's larger merchants saw that some residents of Pittsburgh's East End were moving to the suburbs, and that suburban shopping malls were consequently growing and expanding. These merchants feared that suburban development would harm East Liberty's status as a market center, and asked the City of Pittsburgh's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to take action.[13] The URA proposed creating an outdoor pedestrian mall on Penn Avenue, to be surrounded by car-friendly roads on which large stores, surrounded by parking lots, could serve shoppers just as the new suburban stores were doing. This plan required the demolition of roughly half of the 254 ac (103 ha) that comprised East Liberty. As noted previously, the area targeted for demolition roughly aligned with those parts of the neighborhood redlined in 1937. After some contentious debate, the plan was approved, and the URA stopped traffic on the busiest part of Penn Avenue (the old Greensburg-Pittsburgh turnpike of Jacob Negley's day) and routed it onto a series of new, one-way thoroughfares (called Penn Circle) that formed a ring around the central business district. Many small shops were destroyed—a million square feet of retail space in all. These demolitions destroyed the dense, walkable commercial district and replaced much of it with unattractive parking lots and vacant properties, hastening the decline of the businesses that remained. While the URA was remaking the street plan of East Liberty, the City of Pittsburgh's housing authority made a second set of changes to the neighborhood. Housing authority planners noted that the nearby African-American neighborhood of Homewood was overcrowded, largely as a result of the URA's earlier demolition of the lower Hill District to create the Civic Arena, which had forced many of the Hill's African-Americans out and into the North Side and Homewood. The housing authority's solution was to build three large housing complexes, each close to 20 stories tall, in East Liberty along the new Penn Circle roads. These two measures ultimately failed to preserve East Liberty as a market center, and arguably hastened the old neighborhood's demise. By routing cars away from Penn Avenue, the URA's new street plan seemed to send a message that the neighborhood's commercial center was not worth visiting. The housing authority's massive housing complexes quickly developed a reputation as centers for crime, and this reputation likely did as much as the confusing street plan to drive commerce away from East Liberty.[14] Redlining had already driven away middle class homebuyers, and the public housing complexes were exclusively for low-income renters. This created population demographics that were severely poor and unable to support a healthy commercial sector. Urban renewal had devastating consequences for the neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959 but only 292 in 1970 and just 98 in 1979. The businesses that remained tended not to serve the majority of nearby Pittsburghers, but only the captive audience that remained in what was now an urban ghetto. Steep population decline followed urban renewal. East Liberty became a segregated neighborhood with high poverty rates, low rates of homeownership, and a legacy of disinvestment that continued well after the Community Reinvestment Act eliminated redlining. In the past 20 years, the population fell from 7,973 in 1990 to 6,871 in 2000,[15] and 5,698 in 2016.[16] The reason for this is both the lingering effects of urban renewal and redlining.[17] A 2018 study of demographic changes in East Liberty suggests that abandonment due to poor property condition drove the bulk of population change in East Liberty.[8] Evidence of previous widespread abandonment exists both in the form of vacant lots which once held homes and in the presence of new homes and apartments built on previously vacant lots. Renewed growth[edit] East Liberty business district along Penn Avenue. In the three decades following 1980, East Liberty has slowly regained its status as a market destination for shoppers. In 1979, Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh National Bank, local property owners and other businesses created a nonprofit community development corporation, East Liberty Development, Inc. (ELDI).[18] and hired an executive director, David Feehan. During the 1980s, a number of important developments occurred, spearheaded by ELDI, which acquired and renovated a vacant hotel (now 100 Sheridan Square); purchased the block that included the Regent Theater and Penn Highland Building; and worked with developers to bring the first market rate condo to the community and a new shopping center called East Liberty Station on Penn Avenue, east of Penn Circle. During the 1980s, the collection of small shops on Penn Circle South expanded, more than 200 businesses located in East Liberty, and more than $80 million was invested in real estate development. In the fifteen years following its founding, ELDI focused on rehabilitating some of the East Liberty's historic commercial spaces. These included the Regent Theater (now called the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater)[19] and Motor Square Garden. ELDI's rehabilitation projects were time-consuming, and they did not make the neighborhood the destination for shoppers that it had formerly been. For example, ELDI and the Massaro Corporation recreated the Motor Square Garden building as an indoor mall in 1988, but consumers did not respond.[20] The American Automobile Association bought the building in bankruptcy court in 1991 and now uses it as office space.[21] In addition to its moderately successful property rehabilitation efforts during the 1980s, ELDI was able to remove the failed pedestrian mall on Penn Avenue and return that thoroughfare to its traditional use as a two-way street. These successes set the stage for a large and somewhat controversial series of developments in the late 1990s and 2000s. Between 1996 and 2006, ELDI and the City of Pittsburgh worked to attract new “big box” retailers to East Liberty and to remove the 20-story housing projects that surrounded the neighborhood. First, ELDI and the City used tax increment financing to lure two national retailers to the neighborhood: Home Depot and Whole Foods. Both of these stores thrived, and their success convinced small local merchants and other national retailers to invest in the neighborhood.[22][23] Second, after a complex and time-consuming set of transactions, two of the three housing projects that visually barricaded the neighborhood were demolished in 2005, and the third was demolished in May 2009.[24] The EastSide development in East Liberty. Because these efforts involved resettling the largely African-American population of East Liberty's housing projects and attracting several high-end retailers, ELDI and the City have been criticized for acting as agents of Gentrification.[25][26][27] Some of these concerns have been assuaged by new mixed-income residential developments which have begun to replace the demolished housing projects, as the new developments provide arguably nicer and safer accommodations for some of the projects’ former residents - but much fewer of them.[28][29][30] By 2009, East Liberty more closely resembled the busy commercial neighborhood of 1959 than the struggling ghetto of 1979. Merchants continue to invest in the neighborhood, and outside observers consider it to be fully rehabilitated.[31][32] In 2010, The New York Times published an article about the revival of East Liberty, and cited the presence of a Google office as a sign of the neighborhood's success.[33] In 2011, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published an article entitled \"The trend toward shared working areas arrives\" which describes the creation of The Beauty Shoppe, East Liberty's first Coworking space. The space is owned by East Liberty Development Inc and currently houses several start ups and small businesses. The first business tenant was Thinktiv, Inc., a venture accelerator. Thinktiv was part of The Beauty Shoppe redevelopment effort alongside East Liberty Development Inc. and Edile, a real estate development firm.[34][35] The Highland Building hi-rise, vacant for 20 years, has been converted into luxurious apartments, as has the adjacent Wallace Building, through Walnut Capital, a local real estate company that also owns part of Bakery Square.[36] In April 2014, the streets making up Penn Circle were renamed, removing a highly visible reminder of the failed urban renewal plans of the 1960s. Several historic street names were restored, and Centre Avenue was extended beyond its original (pre-1968) terminus at Penn Avenue to East Liberty Boulevard, affording visitors to the neighborhood a less confusing path toward the business district.[37] In June 2014, USA Today named East Liberty one of the ten best up and coming neighborhoods around the USA.[38] Transportation[edit] East Liberty is served by the East Liberty station, also called the East Liberty Transit Center, on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway. This station was redeveloped in 2015. The publicly funded project aimed at transit-oriented development, placing residents and retail in close proximity to mass transit in order to encourage urban density and discourage automobile use. The transit center increases accessibility to the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway that runs along the ravine where the Pennsylvania Railroad once ran. The busway connects Downtown with East End neighborhoods and eastern suburbs of Allegheny County. This $150 million project covers a total of 6 acres and added 3000 square feet of mixed-use commercial space.[39] This project has been a catalyst for heated debates in the past three years about the lack of affordable housing in East Liberty. The project's tax abatement program, which is meant to encourage development in the East Liberty transit district, has resulted in public funds being granted to private developers for high-end development, including hundreds of luxury apartments. [40] Culture[edit] In 2009, the Remnant Choir from East Liberty's Mt. Ararat Baptist Church won second place, and $20,000 in prize money, in a national contest that was sponsored by Verizon Wireless, and was designed to find the \"Best Church Choir in America.\"[41] Legendary actor and dancer Gene Kelly was born in East Liberty in 1912. David Tepper, a business man, owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers and the MLS's Charlotte FC lived in East Liberty.

Founded in 1794, it houses one of the largest theological libraries in the tri-state area. History[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s Western Theological Seminary and the United Presbyterian Church of North America's Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. The consolidation was the result of the 1958 merger between the PCUSA and the UPCNA to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary began with the founding of Service Seminary (Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service, Beaver County, Pennsylvania) in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania. Prior to that time, the Presbytery was dependent on a supply of ministers sent from Scotland. John Anderson was elected as the first teacher of divinity and the school began with an enrollment of six students. Service Seminary moved several times, from Service to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, then to Xenia, Ohio, where it became Xenia Theological Seminary. This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in the Midwest. Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 (leaving 4th United Presbyterian Church in Allegheny, Pennsylvania). In approximately 1914, Kyle was appointed president. In 1920, the trustees determined to move the seminary to St. Louis, Missouri, also to be nearer to potential students in the Plains states. In 1921, Kyle died unexpectedly. This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root. In 1930, Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825, which was known as Pittsburgh Seminary (1825–1833; 1913–1930) and Allegheny Seminary (1833–1912).[1] Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. This institution was later augmented by the resources of Newburgh Seminary, founded in New York City in 1805 by John Mitchell Mason. Western Theological Seminary, the other branch of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's pre-1959 history, began with the establishment of classical academies in Washington, Pennsylvania, the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan. Out of these academies, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary. It was indeed a western seminary in 1825, furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River.[2] Since the 1959 consolidation, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has been located on the former Pittsburgh-Xenia Seminary campus in the Highland Park/East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. It became a PC (USA) seminary following the 1983 merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Academics[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The seminary has scholars in all major fields of theological inquiry and offers language training in Greek and Hebrew. The following degrees are offered by the institution:[3] Master of Divinity (M.Div.) Master of Arts in Pastoral Studies (M.A.P.S.) Master of Theological Studies (MTS) Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) Focus areas include Science and Theology, Missional Leadership, Reformed, Christian Spirituality, Intergenerational Black Church Studies, Eastern Christian, and Creative Writing & Public Theology.[4] The Seminary also cooperates with other institutions within the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education to offer joint degree programs, including: Master of Divinity/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) M.A.P.S./Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) MTS/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University) Master of Divinity/Master of Social Work (University of Pittsburgh) Clifford E. Barbour Library[edit] The Clifford E. Barbour Library[5] is a theological library in Western Pennsylvania. Its 300,000 volumes, several online databases, and more than 800 periodical subscriptions make it one of the larger stand-alone theological libraries in the United States.[6] The library is located in a three-story building of American Colonial design, dedicated in 1964. The library houses several valuable collections, including the John M. Mason Memorial Collection, which consists of many rare theological works dating from the Reformation. On display in the Hansen Reading Room are the desk and chair of Karl Barth, dedicated to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary by Barth's son, Markus Barth, a faculty member from 1963–1972.[7] Many of the books and periodicals in the collection were made possible by a $15 million gift from wealthy banker and businessman Thomas Clinton. The library was managed by Dikran Hadidian during its formative years. Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology[edit] Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is home to the Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The museum contains a collection of ancient Near Eastern and Palestinian pottery and artifacts brought together by travelers and archeologists over the past 60 years. Many exhibits resulted from the eight excavations of which the seminary has been a part. The Seminary is very involved in Biblical archaeology, and sponsors the Zeitah Excavations in Israel at Tel Zayit.[8] The excavation was founded under the direction of Professor Ron E. Tappy, Professor of Bible and Archaeology and director of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The excavation began in 1999 with a 55-member international team of experts and volunteers. In July 2005 excavators discovered the Zayit Stone, which contained an inscription dating to the 10th century BCE (King Solomon's reign). The two-line inscription, on a 33-pound limestone boulder embedded in the stone wall of a building, is the earliest securely-dated example of the complete Hebrew alphabet (an \"abecedary\"). The letters show a transitional script emerging from Phoenician and leading to the Hebrew national script of the 9th century BCE. The first significant inscription from this period in nearly a century, the discovery was reported in the New York Times. World Mission Initiative[edit] World Mission Initiative (WMI) at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is a fellowship of Presbyterians.[9] WMI prepares seminarians to become pastors, and coordinates cross-cultural trips. It has a church focus and works to train world Christian pastors. WMI hosts missionaries, national church leaders, and scholars on campus throughout the year. Faculty and alumni[edit] Prominent faculty from the seminary's history include: Dale Allison M. Craig Barnes Robert A. J. Gagnon John Gerstner Archibald Alexander Hodge William Swan Plumer Andrew Purves Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield Robert Dick Wilson Prominent alumni include: Thomas K. Chadwick John A. Dalles Festo Kivengere, sometimes referred to as \"the Billy Graham of Africa\", a Ugandan Anglican Bishop of Kigezi, evangelist, and fierce critic of Idi Amin's excesses.

It was a pioneer of site-specific installation art and features permanent installations by artists Yayoi Kusama,[3] James Turrell,[4] and Greer Lankton.[5] The museum's roof itself is a light art installation and part of Pittsburgh's Northside evening skyline.[6][7] Barbara Luderowski purchased a derelict Stearns & Foster mattress warehouse in 1975. The museum achieved non-profit status in 1977.[8] Over the next forty years, Luderowski would attract upcoming installation artists to fill its rooms. The Mattress Factory along with its neighbors City of Asylum and Randyland are credited with playing a role in Pittsburgh's revitalization.[9] History[edit] In 1975, artist and Mattress Factory founder Barbara Luderowski purchased a former Stearns & Foster mattress warehouse at 500 Sampsonia Way in Pittsburgh's Central Northside. Originally, she used the warehouse as a space to live, work and build a community of artists and intellectuals. The community grew and in 1977—after two years of hosting art exhibits and a small food co-op—the Mattress Factory was established as a legal non-profit educational and cultural corporation. Its first exhibition of installation art opened five years later on May 8, 1982, and the museum has since grown to be an integral part of the Pittsburgh arts community, known for its artist residency program, educational programming, and unique exhibitions. In 2008 then-Curator of Exhibitions Michael Olijnyk joined Luderowski in leading the museum as co-director. Over the years the Mattress Factory has acquired more properties for various purposes, including: 1414 Monterey Street, which became a new gallery space Two buildings on North Taylor Street that became artist residences 505 Jacksonia Street, which is now used as a parking lot for museum visitors, and the adjacent lot, which now houses Winifred Lutz's Garden Installation, 1993 516 Sampsonia Way, which opened as gallery space in Fall 2013 Sexual Misconduct Allegations[edit] In September 2018, a report published in Pittsburgh's WESA detailed five employees' allegations of sexual misconduct and the mishandling of the situation by the Mattress Factory and its director, Michael Olijnyk.[10] The complaint was filed with the National Labor Relations Board, and in early January 2019, a settlement was reached and the investigation was closed.[11] Long-term exhibitions[edit] As of 2024[update], the Mattress Factory hosts 20 long-term installations.[12] The following is a list: Name Artist Year Handrail A Collaboration 1993 Danaë James Turrell 1983 Pleiades James Turrell 1983 Ship of Fools: Discovery of Time Bill Woodrow 1986 Untitled Jene Highstein 1986 Bed Sitting Rooms for an Artist in Residence Allan Wexler 1988 Trespass William Anastasi 1991 Catso, Red James Turrell 1994 Untitled (Calisthenic Series) William Anastasi 1997 Music for a Garden Rolf Julius 1996 Ash Rolf Julius 1991 Red Rolf Julius 1996 Acupuncture Hans Peter Kuhn 2016 Repetitive Vision Yayoi Kusama 1996 Infinity Dots Mirrored Room Yayoi Kusama 1996 It's All About ME, Not You Greer Lankton 1996 Garden Winifred Lutz 1997 610-3356 Sarah Oppenheimer 2008 Unbrella Vanessa Sica & Chris Kasabach 2009 Ground Dove Bradshaw 1994 Gallery[edit] Repetitive Vision installation by Yayoi Kusama Mattress Factory building The Mattress Factory Annex Gallery Garden Installation by Winifred Lutz References[edit] ^ O'Driscoll, Bill (May 31, 2018). \"Visionary Mattress Factory Founder Barbara Luderowski Dies At 88\".

It has a zip code of 15212, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 (Downtown/Northshore Neighborhoods). Originally known as \"The Buena Vista Tract\", it is densely filled with restored row houses, community gardens and tree lined streets and alleyways. History[edit] In the late 19th century, Allegheny, Pennsylvania (later annexed by Pittsburgh) became known for its stately homes, occupied by some of the area's wealthy families. One such area became known as the Mexican War Streets. Mexican War Streets[edit] The Mexican War Streets were laid out in 1847, during the Mexican–American War, by William Robinson Jr., ex-mayor of the city of Allegheny. Robinson, who contrary to some tellings did not actually serve in the war, subdivided his land and named the new streets after the war's battles and generals (Buena Vista Street, Filson Way, Monterey Street, Palo Alto Street, Resaca Place, Sherman Avenue, Taylor Avenue).[2] City Steps[edit] The Central Northside neighborhood has 4 distinct flights of city steps. In Central Northside, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and neighborhood schools.[3] The O'Hern Street city steps connect residents to the Propel Northside charter school. Photo by Laura Zurowski. Surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods[edit] Central Northside has seven city neighborhood borders with Perry South to the north, Fineview to the northeast, East Allegheny to the southeast, Allegheny Center to the south, Allegheny West to the southwest, Manchester to the west and California-Kirkbride to the northwest. Fictional Portrayals[edit] The 1979 sports/cult classic The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh used the neighborhoods southern border of North Avenue's gritty former \"burlesque row\" adjacent to the Garden Theater to depict Stockard Channing's gypsy fortune teller characters office and residence. Thirty years later, in 2010, the Katherine Heigl film One for the Money[4] uses the same exact buildings complete with Garden Theater marquee to once again depict a gritty inner city environment—though much of the characters and vice of the North Avenue corridor has been corrected, the structures still adapt well on the areas southern border.

Name[edit] On 10 September 2012, the Central Northside Neighborhood Council (CNNC) voted to change the neighborhood's name to Allegheny City Central.[5][6] However, according to an FAQ published by the CNNC in August 2012, the Council reported that official city maps would \"probably not\" reflect the name change and that the city planning department is \"always very reluctant\" to alter established names. The same document refers to the name change as a \"branding initiative\" which is part of a \"new brand and marketing strategy\".[7] See also[edit] List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods References[edit] ^ a b \"PGHSNAP 2010 Raw Census Data by Neighborhood\".

Description[edit] The Miller ICA supports art experimentation that expands the notions of art and culture, providing a forum for engaged conversations about creativity and innovation. The gallery produces exhibitions, projects, events, and publications with a focus on social issues, and has been supported by the Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts.[1] The gallery is housed in a three-story, 8,000-square-foot (740 m2) space located in the Purnell Center for the Arts on the university campus at 5000 Forbes Avenue, at the border between the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods. Exhibitions are free and open to the public.[2] History[edit] Originally known as the Miller Gallery, the exhibition space was founded in 2000 by Regina Gouger Miller, who is an artist, educator, businesswoman, arts patron, and alumna of Carnegie Mellon School of Art.[1] Petra Fallaux, director of the existing Hewlett Gallery, inaugurated the space. In 2002, Jenny Strayer was hired as director and served until 2007. Astria Suparak served as director and curator of the gallery from 2008 until 2014. In 2014, the College terminated the position of director/curator and changed the mission of the gallery.[3] The Miller ICA has exhibited work by Francis Alÿs, Laylah Ali, Janine Antoni, The Art Guys, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Michael Bevilacqua, Tammy Rae Carland, The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI), Center for PostNatural History, Catherine Chalmers, Michael Ray Charles, Mel Chin, Julia Christensen, Minerva Cuevas, Nicole Eisenman, Inka Essenhigh, Karen Finley, Rachel Harrison, Todd Haynes, Arturo Herrera, Miranda July, Justseeds, Tran T.

Kamin Science Center,[2][needs update] is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Chateau[3] neighborhood. It is located across the street from Acrisure Stadium. Overview[edit] The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, and is located along the Ohio River on the North Shore. It has four floors of interactive exhibits totaling over 400 exhibits, and attracts nearly 500,000 visitors each year.[1][4] Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Giant Theater (promoted as \"the biggest screen in Pittsburgh\"), a physical home for some of Carnegie Mellon University’s Robot Hall of Fame (in the lobby of the Rangos Giant Cinema),[5] SportsWorks, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and the USS Requin (a World War II submarine). Updates[edit] According to Nicholas Efran, \"The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years.\" However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are \"Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building\"[6] In June 2018, the museum's new wing opened, allowing the museum to host new and larger exhibits. In August 2021, the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment extended the center's use of its 450-space parking lot until 2026, at which point it will need to significantly reduce the space number to 75 spaces to conform to zoning regulations.[7] In October 2021, the center received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Communities for Immunity initiative because of its support of vaccine confidence in the Pittsburgh community. It used the $10,000 award to contribute to its COVID-19 vaccination awareness programs.[8] In June 2022, § Roboworld closed. Some of the inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame, such as C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star Wars, Maria from Metropolis, as well as HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, were moved to the Rangos Giant Cinema. The big, free-throw-shooting basketball robot was moved to the § SportsWorks facility. Andy Roid, the singing Robothespian that greets visitors, was moved to the Science Center’s main lobby. All other robots from the exhibit went into storage \"until the Science Center decides what to do with it\".[5][9] History[edit] Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science, which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States, and was popular for several decades. However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger.[10] The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.[11] On January 23, 2024, the Carnegie Science Center announced that they received a 65 million dollar donation from Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin. In honor of the donation they announced plans to rename the center to The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center[12] Roboworld (until 2022)[edit] Roboworld formerly at the Carnegie Science Center The Roboworld area was the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center until June 19, 2022.[9] It was touted as \"the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition\", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring \"all things robotic\".[13] Until it closed, the first robot encounter in Roboworld was Andy Roid, the Robothespian, an interactive, animatronic robot that introduced visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, processing and acting. The area's other exhibits showcased different types of robots and videos about them. Roboworld was also home to famous robots such as R2D2, Hal9000, C-3PO, and Gort.[14] The Robot Hall of Fame featured famous robots from science fiction films, television, and video games, such as R2-D2, C-3PO, Data, the T-800 Terminator, R.O.B., Maschinenmensch, Gort, Robby the Robot, Robot B-9, HAL 9000, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Silent Running. Highmark SportsWorks[edit] Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center. It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate.[15] The main idea of SportsWorks is \"to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports.\"[15] SportsWorks features three themed areas: Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports). The previous sponsor, UPMC, ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) SportsWorks, sponsored by Highmark. It reopened in the Fall of 2009.[16] From October 8, 2007, until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit BODIES... The Exhibition. At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit.[17] A committee from Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the North Shore Connector, an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh.[18] E-motion cone[edit] The E-motion cone is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It is referred to as the Weather Cone and was designed by New York architect Shashi Caan and lighting designer Matthew Tanteri.

The Nationality Rooms are a group of 31 classrooms in the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning depicting and donated by the national and ethnic groups that helped build the city of Pittsburgh. The rooms are designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation historical landmark and are located on the 1st and 3rd floors of the Cathedral of Learning, itself a national historic landmark,[4][5] on the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Although of museum caliber, 29 of the 31 rooms are used as daily classrooms by University of Pittsburgh faculty and students, while the other two (the Early American and Syrian-Lebanon) are display rooms viewed through glass doors, utilized primarily for special events, and can only be explored via special guided tour. The Nationality Rooms also serve in a vigorous program of intercultural involvement and exchange in which the original organizing committees for the rooms remain as participants and which includes a program of annual student scholarship to facilitate study abroad.[6] In addition, the Nationality Rooms inspire lectures, seminars, concerts exhibitions, and social events which focus on the various heritages and traditions of the nations represented. The national, traditional, and religious holidays of the nations represented are celebrated on campus and the rooms are appropriately decorated to reflect these occasions. The Nationality Rooms are available daily for public tours as long as the particular room is not being used for a class or other university function.[7] History[edit] The Nationality Room Program was founded by Ruth Crawford Mitchell at the request of Pitt Chancellor John Bowman in 1926, in order to involve the community in constructing the Cathedral of Learning and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to national communities in the Pittsburgh area to sponsor a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group formed a Room Committee responsible for fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, \"...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms.\"[8] Each room is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials. Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the cathedral. A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965 when E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion of twelve additional rooms on the third floor. Bruhns retired on Jan. 1, 2020, after 54 years in the position, and died in July 2020.[9][10] The Nationality Rooms Information, tours, and gift shop center just off the Commons Room A typical room on the 1st floor built between 1938 and 1957 took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of $467,927 today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the Great Depression and World War II. More recent rooms have cost in the range of US$750,000 and up, and took up to ten years to complete.[11] Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad. The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms. The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the University libraries, publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages. National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions. The first four rooms to be dedicated were the Scottish, Russian, German, and Swedish Rooms in 1938.\"[12] The newest rooms are the Turkish and Swiss rooms, both dedicated in 2012,[13][14] the Korean room dedicated in 2015,[15] and the Philippine Room dedicated in 2019.[16] Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of \"Pennsylvania\" classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor \"Pittsburgh\" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the Western Pennsylvania or different eras of American history.[17][18] Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, the Early American Classroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor. The English Classroom, the largest of the 31 Nationality Rooms, contains several artifacts from the original second House of Commons Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held with a formal presentation of a ceremonial key to the university's Chancellor to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift, and a commitment by the university to maintain the room in perpetuity. The nationality room committee officers then become members of the Nationality Council which provides scholarships for summer study abroad for Pitt students, along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today,[as of?] the cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms (29 working classrooms and two display rooms: the Early American Room and the Syrian-Lebanon Room), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room celebrates a different culture that influenced Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the university's founding and the signing of the United States Constitution. Only one room does not follow this convention, with the French Classroom depicting the First French Empire of the early 19th century. There are two additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded.[citation needed] Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the university: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts: Faith and peace are in their hearts. Good will has brought them together. Like the Magi of ancestral traditions and the shepherds of candid simplicity, they offer their gifts of what is precious, genuine and their own, to truth that shines forever and enlightens all people.[8] Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization, Quo Vadis (Latin: Where do you go?), that guides over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year. Principles[edit] The Indian Classroom, opened in 2000, is one of the newer Nationality Rooms that continue to be installed on the third floor The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957. A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the United States Department of State. The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic, not political. The period depicted should be prior to 1787, the year the university was founded. To avoid political implications in the room, no political symbol is permitted in the decorations, nor a portrait or likeness of any living person. The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the room's entrance. No donor recognition may appear in the rooms. Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book. Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad. This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design. In the 1970s, policy revisions were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life. This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room. The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom. New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to \"teach\" about the cultures with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts. Classrooms[edit] African Heritage[edit] The African Heritage Classroom African Heritage ClassroomLocationRoom 330DedicatedDecember 17, 1989ConceptDr. Laurence GlascoStyle18th century Asante TempleArchitectWilliam J. Bates, A.I.A. The African Heritage Classroom was designed to reflect an 18th-century Asante temple courtyard in Ghana which would provide the setting for ceremonial events, learning, and worship. The classroom represents the entire continent of Africa with Yoruba-style door carvings by Nigerian sculptor Lamidi O. Fakeye depicting ancient kingdoms of Africa including Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, Benin, Kongo/Angola, Kuba, Mali, and Zimbabwe. Plaster forms in the frieze represent the arts, music, science, languages, and literature of Africa. A display case housing artifacts from various African nations and the chalkboard area reflect patos around the courtyard. Below the chalkboard doors depicting the Igbo lozenge and star motif are Sankofa birds which symbolize the need to learn from the past in order to prepare for the future. The oxblood steps, two levels of student benches, and wainscot with relief decorations suggest the polished clay of an Asante temple. Openwork screens are present on the windows as they are used in Asante structures to filter the sun's rays while allowing air flow. Six chieftain stools provide informal seating near a hand-carved professor's lectern. Armenian[edit] The Armenian Classroom Armenian ClassroomLocationRoom 319DedicatedAugust 28, 1988Style10th–12th century MonasticArchitectTorkom Khrimian The Armenian Classroom[19] was inspired by the 10th- to 12th-century Sanahin Monastery. The design consists of intersecting arches and a domed ceiling built to lessen damage from frequent earthquakes in that country. The room's arches, built of Indiana limestone, make this the heaviest of the Nationality Rooms, weighing 22 tons, and required the second floor beneath the room to be reinforced in order to support its weight. The cornerstone is a basalt stone from the grounds of Sanahin. In the mortar behind it are the thumbprints of five of the oldest Armenian diaspora living in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the handprint of an infant of Armenian descent, symbolizing the continuity of the Armenian presence in western Pennsylvania. Austrian[edit] The Austrian Classroom Austrian ClassroomLocationRoom 314DedicatedJune 9, 1996Style17th–18th century BaroqueArchitectsFranz Gerhardt Schnögass, ViennaGunther J. Kaier, A.I.A. Pittsburgh The Austrian Nationality Room represents the 18th-century era of the Austrian Empire during its age of enlightenment under Empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II and incorporates Baroque elements of the Haydnsaal in Schloss Esterházy at Eisenstadt where Joseph Haydn served as Kapellmeister from 1766 to 1778. Ceiling paintings depict scenes from Roman mythology similar to those in the Haydnsaal. The room features Lobmeyer crystal chandeliers, gilded white lacquer seminar furniture patterned after that in the formal dining hall of Vienna's Hofburg, royal red-tapestried walls, gold-leafed pilasters, and a parquet floor inlaid in a starburst design. Exhibits in the display cases in the room trace the development of the multinational Austrian Empire and the birthplaces of representative Austrian composers born within its borders between the years 1000 and 1918. Chinese[edit] The Chinese Classroom Chinese ClassroomLocationRoom 136DedicatedOctober 6, 1939Style18th-century Chinese EmpireDesignerTeng Kwei, BeijingArchitectHenry Killiam Murphy The Chinese Classroom is inspired by the design of a palace hall in Beijing's Forbidden City and is dedicated to the memory of Confucius and his democratic ideal of classless education. The teacher and students sit at the same level around a moon-shaped teakwood table. The professor's chair is carved with the admonition to \"Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily\". A slate portrait of Confucius is present that is patterned after one in the Confucian temple at his birthplace of Qufu in Shandong Province. Above the red lacquered door, Chinese characters are carved into the stone lintel that proclaim that \"Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character.\" Stone lions flank the entrance before carvings of the plum blossom, the national flower of China. The ceiling contains a coiling golden five-clawed imperial dragon surrounded by clouds denoting nature's energy and freedom. Painted squares portray dragons guarding the pearl of wisdom and the phoenix with the motan flower, a symbol of cultural wealth. The opened blackboard doors reveal painted renditions of the babao, or Eight Treasures, popular in Chinese art. On the base below is a carved version of the Bagua which consists of eight trigrams surrounding the circular Yin and Yang. Windows consist of frosted glass with stylized cames. Czechoslovak[edit] The Czechoslovak Classroom Czechoslovak ClassroomLocationRoom 113DedicatedMarch 7, 1939StyleFolk MotifArchitectDr. Bohumil Sláma, Prague The Czechoslovak Classroom combines elements of a Slovak farmhouse, country church, and the Charles University in Prague while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former Czechoslovak government in exile, is proclaimed by the inscription of \"Pravda Vítězí\" which translates to \"Truth Will Prevail\" and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls John Amos Comenius' belief that \"education is the workshop of humanity\". All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of larch wood which grows to great heights in the Carpathian Mountains. The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by Prague artists Karel Svolinský and Marie Svolinská and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches. A \"tree of life\" design on the rear wall surrounds the text of the proclamation by King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles IV that marked the founding of the University of Prague in 1348. The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting \"peasant writings\" and executed by the artists in freehand. Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in Czech and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrillic script, Waclaw who was the \"Good King Wenceslaus\" of the Christmas Carol, Jan Hus who was a champion of Czech religious freedom, John Amos Comenius who is considered the father of modern education, Ján Kollár a Slovak poet who called for Slavic unity, Ľudovít Štúr who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in Slovakia. Intarsia done by V. Kopka of Moravia are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines. Embroidery, lace, Bohemian crystal, and historical documents are displayed in the wall cabinet.[20] Early American[edit] The Early American Classroom Early American RoomLocationRoom 328Presented1938Style17th century New England ColonialArchitectTheodore H. Bowman, A.I.A. Pittsburgh The Early American Room is one of two display rooms not used as a functional classroom, although it is opened for guided tours. The room was commissioned by longtime University Pittsburgh trustee George Hubbard Clapp, a descendant nine generations removed from Roger Clapp, an English captain who sailed into the New England port of Hull on May 30, 1630. The kitchen-living room of the early colonists was chosen to portray the sturdy simplicity of life in America during the 1650s.[21] The room's focus is a nine-foot fireplace constructed from 200-year-old handmade bricks with \"fixings\" of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, longhandled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles, and forks. A small recess in the brick wall served to bake bread. A tapered pole swings out from the end of the fireplace to be used for drying laundry or to hang a quilt to keep the cold draft from those gathered near the fire. Massive hand-hewn pine beams used in the seven-foot-high ceiling and the fireplace were collected after a careful search in Massachusetts. White pine is used for the heavy seminar table, benches, and chairs.[22] Wrought-iron candelabra are hinged with clasps to hold lighting tapers. Other light fixtures are of specially designed pierced tin.[23] The colonial-style windows were designed by glass artist Charles Connick.[24] Decorative items include a collection of 17th- and 18th-century American coins, a working spinning wheel, and a hand-stitched sampler. The small closet between the blackboard and fireplace contains a secret panel and once the concealed latch is discovered, its release causes the wall to swing open, revealing a hidden staircase to the upper loft, which has been furnished as a 19th-century bedroom. Included in the bedroom is a four-poster rope bed and small cradle, both of which belonged to pianist and composer Ethelbert Nevin. The bedroom also includes several personal items, including an 1878 wedding quilt, which belonged to Waitman Worthington McDaniel and his wife Martha Jane Poe, the grandmother of Nationality Director Maxine Bruhns.[25] The room is associated with various stories of unexplained incidents that have resulted in claims that the room is haunted.[25][26] English[edit] The English Classroom English ClassroomLocationRoom 144DedicatedNovember 21, 1952Style16th century Tudor-GothicArchitectAlbert A. Klimcheck The English Classroom is designed in the Tudor-Gothic style after the House of Commons that was rebuilt by Sir Charles Barry following the fire of 1834. The English Classroom is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and incorporates several original items given as gifts from the British Government from the damaged House of Commons, whose Chamber was completely destroyed, following its bombing by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the stone fireplace, hearth tiles, linenfold oak paneling, entrance doorframe, lintel, and corbels. The fireplace is from the Commons' \"Aye Lobby\", so named because members walk through it to vote \"yes\" to a bill, and is marked with the initials V.R. for Victoria Regina. The cast-iron fireback and andirons commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and an inscription above the fireplace is from Shakespeare's King Richard II and uses lettering adapted from the letter tiles originally designed for medieval paving by the Monks of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey. The inscription reads: \"Set in the silver sea.....this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.\" Above the doorway hangs a royal coat of arms made in 1688 during the reign of King James II. The linenfold paneling itself arrived at the university still having a blackened coat from the bombing.[27] Under the ceiling trusses are four carved limestone corbels from the House of Commons that are carved with a Tudor rose. Two corbels remain uncarved to emphasize the original carved corbels. The window frames, set in limestone, are characteristic of the Tudor period, and contain old imported glass, seeded and tinted, and encased in small, diamond-shaped leaded frames. Stained-glass window medallions depict the coats of arms of English towns and cities, literary and political figures, scholars of the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, and the Houses of Lords and Commons. Portraits of University of Pittsburgh alumnus and former Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Andrew Mellon, and the former Earl of Chatham, William Pitt, after whom the city was named, flank the stained glass windows in the rear bay. A brick from 10 Downing Street serves as the room's cornerstone. The white oak floor is fitted together with wooden peg dowels. Tudor-Gothic oak benches resemble the old House of Commons benches and are similarly arranged. Two English oak tables with melon-shaped legs stand before the bay. Two House of Commons Library chairs upholstered in green leather and bearing the official gold crest featuring the portcullis and crown were a gift of Lord Alfred Bossom and were rebuilt using wood from actual chairs in the bombed House of Commons.[28][29] French[edit] The French Classroom French ClassroomLocationRoom 149DedicatedJanuary 23, 1943StyleLate 18th-century French EmpireArchitectJacques Carlu, Paris The French Classroom was designed by Jacques Carlu, Director of the School of Architecture in Fontainebleau, in the French Empire Period that reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past that were rediscovered during the Napoleonic campaigns in Greece, Italy, and Egypt. This places the timeframe of inspiration for the classroom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, just after the founding of the University of Pittsburgh in 1787, therefore making it the only classroom which represents an era postdating the founding of the university, although many room elements are influenced by the Palace of Versailles which clearly predates it. The color scheme of the room is blue-gray, royal blue, and gold, which were suggested by French-American architect Paul Philippe Cret and are typical colors used at the height of the French Empire. The walls of the room are lined with wood paneling in classical proportions, and slender wall pilasters are capped with delicately carved ad gilded crowns. Carved ornaments of the Egyptian griffin and classical rosettes accentuate panel divisions. A wall cabinet containing art objects, books, and medallions balances the entrance door and maintains the room's symmetry. Crystal and metal chandeliers, which are simplified versions of those found in Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors, hang from a grey plaster ceiling. A parquet floor pattern also reflects many rooms in the Palace of Versailles. A mahogany professor's chair and table are of the Directoire period design include bronze ornaments imported from France that are replicas of originals of Empire furniture in the Louvre. The mahogany student tablet armchairs are upholstered in royal blue. On the rear wall, a 16th-century Choufleur tapestry depicts an allegorical woodland scene including, among other animals, a unicorn which often served as a central figure in tapestries and legends from the Middle Ages. Gold damask draperies with a wreath and lyre motif add to the sense of French opulence and frame the windows which look out on the university's Heinz Memorial Chapel, itself an example of French Gothic architecture inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.[30] German[edit] The German Classroom German ClassroomLocationRoom 119DedicatedJuly 8, 1938Style16th-century German RenaissanceArchitectFrank A. Linder, Germany/U.S. The German Classroom was designed by German-born architect Frank A. Linder to reflect the 16th century German Renaissance as exemplified in the Alte Aula (Great Hall) of the University of Heidelberg. The woodwork of the room was done by German-born Philadelphia decorator Gustav Ketterer and includes walnut paneling framing the blackboards, columns carved with arabesques flanking the two entrance doorways, and support broken-arch pediments surmounted by carved polychromed crests of the two oldest German universities: Heidelberg (1386) and Leipzig (1409). The doors are mounted with ornate wrought-iron hinges and locks, and their upper panels are decorated with intarsia depicting the central square of Nürnberg on the front door and the fountain of Rothenburg on the rear door. Carved in the architrave above the paneling are the names of famous philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists. The intarsia doors of the four corner cabinets feature tales from German folklore including Parsifal who searched for the Holy Grail, Siegfried who was the hero of the Nibelungenlied, the maiden wooed in Goethe's poem Heidenröslein, and Lorelei who was the golden-haired Rhine maiden whose song lured sailors to destruction. Painted on the escutcheon above the front blackboard are words from Friedrich Schiller's Das Ideal und das Leben, \"Stern endeavor, which no arduous task can shake, to the hidden fount of true attains.\" The rear wall has a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Was wir bringen which reads: \"Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone points the way to liberty.\" Furniture includes the professor's leather upholstered chair stands on a small platform behind a burled walnut table and student tablet armchairs are walnut with scroll backs. Wrought-iron chandeliers are the work of German craftsman. The display case contains gifts of artworks and books from Germany's Ministry of Education. The stained-glass windows were designed by master stained glass artist Charles Connick, however they were not completed until 1953 by Connick protege Frances Van Arsdale Skinner.[24] The windows depict characters in the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Hansel and Gretel, and Cinderella.[31] Greek[edit] The Greek Classroom Greek ClassroomLocationRoom 137DedicatedNovember 7, 1941Style5th Century B.C. ClassicalArchitectJohn Travlos, Athens The classical architecture of the Greek Classroom[32] represents 5th-century BCE. Athens, the Golden Age of Pericles and includes marble columns and a coffered ceiling. Colored details from the Acropolis' Propylaea and Erectheum appear on white marble. The floor is paved with rectangular slabs of Dionessos Pentelic marble with dark vein.[33] Gray Kokinara marble is used for the dado. The room's columns and pilasters, as well as the coffered ceiling, bear painted decorations identical to those used on ancient Greek structures. The artwork was done by Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis who used the traditional encaustic painting method, employing earth colors and beeswax applied freehand which was then overlaid with 24-carat gold leaf rubbed on by polishing bones which required two men more than seven months to complete. White oak furniture, patterned after designs on Greek vases, is decorated with gold-leaf carvings and sunburst inlays of ebony. Student chair backs carry the names of Greek islands and towns. The professor's and guests' chairs bear the names of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. A line from Homer's Iliad exhorts students to strive for nobility and excellence. The deep red wall color is repeated in the drapery valance with its Greek key design. Archives in the alcove cabinet record visits by the Queen of Greece, and by ecclesiastic and diplomatic officials. In 1940, one of two marble pilasters for the room that was being constructed in Greece from the Mt Pentele stone quarry used to build the Parthenon, cracked shortly before shipping to the United States. With an invading World War II army massing on its borders, the column could not be replaced. Greek architect John Travlos ordered a matching crack etched into the undamaged column in order to preserve the symmetry. The marble was transported on the last ship to sail to America prior to the invasion and occupation of Greece. In November 1941, Travlos crouched under a blanket in his apartment closet listening to banned BBC radio broadcasts. Suddenly, Greek ecclesiastical music spouted from the radio, and Travlos heard the people of Pittsburgh dedicate his memorial to Greece.[27] Hungarian[edit] The Hungarian Classroom Hungarian ClassroomLocationRoom 121DedicatedSeptember 29, 1939StyleFolk MotifArchitectDénes Györgyi, Budapest Dénes Györgyi, a professor at the Industrial Art School in Budapest, won the Hungarian Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features Magyar folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows. The walls of the room are oak veneer stained a soft tobacco brown. The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns. The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of \"paprika red\", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary. The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and tulips) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest. Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of Himnusz, the Hungarian National Anthem by Ferenc Kölcsey. Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388. At the top is the crown of St. Stephen, the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king. The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back. A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue. Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a \"tulip chest\" which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips. In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls. Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts King Nimrod and his sons, Hunor and Magor, who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile Danube plain. Descendants of Hunor became the Huns and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, pomegranate leaves, daisies, and wheat. The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from plaster models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity.[34] Indian[edit] The Indian Classroom Indian ClassroomLocationRoom 327DedicatedJanuary 9, 2000Style4th–9th-century Indian RenaissanceArchitectDeepak Wadhwani, A.I.A. The Indian Classroom is modeled on a typical 4th–9th century AD courtyard from Nalanda University, a Buddhist monastic university in Nalanda. At its peak, the university's five temples and 11 monasteries covered 32 acres (130,000 m2) and attracted thousands of students from all over Asia. The room depicts a classroom courtyard at Nalanda. The pale rose bricks, specially fabricated to reflect the hue and texture of the original, form the walls, floor, pilasters, and niches. Six stone columns decorated with rosettes, swags, and fruit echo those found at Nalanda. The rear sculpture wall, a scaled down version of one at Nalanda's Stupa #3, bears images of six Bodhisattvas. Flanking display cases hold replicas of ancient bronze sculptures found at the site. A watercolor triptych depicts male and female students at Nalanda as scholar-monk Silabhadra says farewell to 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang. Gurus taught classes in the courtyards, which were surrounded by residential cells. The cherry wood chalkboard doors and flanking cabinets bear carved seals of Nalanda University with recumbent deer above a Sanskrit inscription. Cast steel grilles in front of the windows, hand wrought into forms which reflect decorative elements of the columns, filter the light and soften the view of the 20th-century outside world.[35] Renaissance 3 Architects received the Master Builders Association Craftsmanship Award for its construction.[36] Irish[edit] The Irish Classroom Irish ClassroomLocationRoom 127DedicatedMay 18, 1957Style500–1200 A.D. Irish RomanesqueArchitectHarold G. Leask, Dublin The Irish Classroom is the smallest of the Nationality Rooms.[37] The limestone room is designed in Irish Romanesque style, which flourished from the 6th to the 12th centuries and is similar in type, size, and materials to oratories first built on the west coast of Ireland. Adapted from Killeshin Chapel in County Carlow, the triangular doorway gable is carved with human and animal masks against a background of zig-zag and beaded designs. The blackboard frame's pendental arches are carved with foliage, images of wolfhounds, and stylized cat masks. On the opposite wall a sculptured stone chest, under a monumental recessed arch, is patterned after a bishop's tomb in Cormac's chapel. Its ornate sculpture depicts the \"Great Beast\", a greyhound-like animal wreathed in interlaced ornaments. On the chest rests a replica of the Gospels from the Book of Kells. The wrought-iron case bears bird and beast designs drawn from the Book of Kells. Stained-glass windows, created in 1956/7 by the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin, portray famous teachers at three of Ireland's oldest centers of learning; St. Finnian at Clonard, St. Columkille at Derry, and St. Carthach at Lismore.[38] Illuminations in the Book of Kells inspired the chair design, except for the wolfhound heads. The oak-beamed ceiling is characteristic of Irish oratories. The cornerstone, from the Abbey of Clonmacnoise, is carved with the Gaelic motto, \"For the Glory of God and the Honour of Ireland.\" The cornerstone conceals a container of earth from Northern Ireland (County Armagh) and the Republic of Ireland (County Meath).[39] The room was designed by Harold G. Leask, the former Inspector of National Monuments with The Office of Public Works (The O.P.W.) in Ireland. Gov. David L. Lawrence, Art Rooney Sr., founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and James W. Knox, a member of the Pittsburgh Irish community, were on the room's organizing committee. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy ordered a Marine guard to deliver the Oval Office Presidential and American flags to Evelyn Lincoln, private secretary to the president. In her will, Lincoln bequeathed the flags to the University of Pittsburgh for the Irish Room in honor of Knox. The John F. Kennedy scholarship for study in Ireland and a James W. Knox endowment for graduate study abroad were created from the proceeds generated from their auction.[40] Israel Heritage[edit] The Israel Heritage Classroom Israel Heritage ClassroomLocationRoom 337DedicatedNovember 1, 1987ConceptAlexander KaufmanStyle1st century Israel Stone StructureArchitectMartin Chetlin, A.I.A. The Israel Heritage Classroom reflects the simplicity of a 1st-century Galilean stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd–3rd-century synagogue of Capernaum. The Ten Commandments, carved in Hebrew, grace the oak entrance door. Grapes, pomegranates, and dates on the stone frieze, copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century Rehob synagogue cites the Talmudic laws governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the rear case replicates the Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll segment which contains the prophecy \"They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks...\" Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before a copy of the only existing stone Menorah which served as a functional candelabrum. The quotation on the chair reads: \"I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils.\" Three segments from the 6th-century Dura Europos murals grace the chalkboard doors, Ezra the Scribe, reads the law; Moses brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of Aaron consecrate the Temple. Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of Beth Alpha. Italian[edit] The Italian Classroom Italian ClassroomLocationRoom 116DedicatedMay 14, 1949Style15th-century Italian RenaissanceArchitectEzio Cerpi, Florence The Italian Classroom reflects the serenity of a 15th-century Tuscan monastery, with its traditional devotion to religion, art, music, and education. The rear choir stall bench and shuttered windows introduce the monastic theme. The blackboard doors recall an armadio, a cabinet behind an altar used to hold priestly vestments. The turquoise soffitto a cassettoni (coffered ceiling), embellished with carved, gold-leafed rosettes, was inspired by one originally in the San Domenico Convent at Pesaro. In the architrave, names of famous Italians are inlaid in olive wood. The lettering resembles that used in the inscription on the Arch of Titus in Rome. Bay benches are cushioned in red velvet. The red tile floor is set in a herring-bone pattern similar to that of Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. An original Florentine fireplace, made of sandstone from the quarries of Fiesole, bears the carved Latin inscription, \"O Lord, do not forsake me.\" On either side stand Savonarola chairs. Monastery bench designs, adapted for student use, are carved with names and founding dates of Italian universities. The oldest is the University of Bologna, established in 1088. From the front of the room, a bronze bust of Dante Alighieri faces Giovanni Romagnoli's mural of Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, the first woman in the world to achieve a university degree when she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1678 by the University of Padua. Japanese[edit] The Japanese Classroom Japanese ClassroomLocationRoom 317DedicatedJuly 25, 1999StyleMinkaDesignerHirokazu Nagase, KyotoArchitectNorman Harai, A.I.A. The Japanese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th century minka which were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts of Kyoto and the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanese pine, supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room. The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made of zelkova, (keyaki), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is of bamboo with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below. The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls through the use of textured wallpaper and wooden wainscoting for greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room. The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality. Located on the rear wall, is the tokonoma, a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made of ebony and the floor of the tokonoma is tatami. The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include a chagama and furo, an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the \"tea ceremony\". While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period.[41] Korean[edit] The Korean Classroom Korean ClassroomLocationRoom 304DedicatedNovember 15, 2015StyleJoseon DynastyArchitectMinah Lee, Seoul The Korean Nationality Room is based on the 14th century Myeong-nyundang (Hall of Enlightenment), the main building at the Sungkyunkwan in Seoul which served as Korea's royal academy during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties from 918 to 1897.[42] The room mimics the three connected rooms of the Myeong-nyundan with twin oak columns forming a symbolic boundary and a central room featuring a lofted ceiling that contains two hand-carved phoenixes facing a symbolic pearl of wisdom, a design inspired by the royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty.[43] The room was primarily built off-site in Korea, disassembled, and shipped to Pittsburgh, where it was reassembled in the Cathedral of Learning by Korean carpenters who kept with traditional Korean building practices of not using nails or screws in construction.[42] The room features hand cut and hand engraved Douglas fir and red pine logs from South Korea that include swirling engraved designs based on traditional Korean architecture.[44] Windows are covered with a specially produced paper product made of mulberry tree fiber.[42] A symbolic back door leading to a windowed bay that faces Heinz Chapel alludes to a door in the Myeong-nyudang which leads to the Sungkyunkwan's courtyard.[15] The south wall displays three documents that explain the letters and principles of the Hangul, or Korean alphabet, which was created by the court of Sejong the Great in 1443.[45] A display niche to the right of the classrooms blackboards contains a book illustrating Crown Prince Hyomyeong's matriculation to Sungkyunkwan in 1817, while another niche displays the Four Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper and ink-stone.[45] Furnishings include freestanding, hard-oak desks by Korean designer Ji-hoon Ha that accommodate two to three students and are specifically designed for laptops.[44] The room also contains an 85-inch, 3-D LED screen and central speaker system and is the first nationality room to be constructed with such technology.[42] Lithuanian[edit] The Lithuanian Classroom Lithuanian ClassroomLocationRoom 129DedicatedOctober 4, 1940StyleFolk MotifArchitectAntanas Gudaitis, Kaunas The Lithuanian Classroom is dominated by a fresco depicting Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis' famous painting The Two Kings, which portrays the reverence Lithuanians have for their villages. This mural sets the tone for a room that pays tribute to the symbolism and love of nature and home reflected in Lithuanian folk art. The door's wooden planks are laid in a diamond pattern similar to those of many farm structures. At the center of the door is a carved rosette, symbol of fire. Above the entrance, a stylized sun between two horses' heads represents light and sound believed to ward off evil spirits. The white oak molding of intersecting scallops resembles decorations found on farm granaries or kleitis. Names of famous Lithuanians are carved on the frieze above the blackboard. The wall fabric is linen woven in a design called \"The Path of the Birds\". Its frame is of white oak and rare bog oak that acquires its deep hue while submerged in a marshy bog for decades. Lithuanian farmers would thus preserve prime trees in order to make furniture pieces that were treasured as heirlooms. The professor's desk is modeled after a household table and the lectern incorporates details of a spinning wheel spindle. Student chairs are carved with a design found on household utensils. The radiator enclosure is perforated with a design of wild rue leaves, a Lithuanian national emblem. Traditionally, a bride is crowned with a wreath of rue, symbol of chastity. Windows of handpressed glass bear leaded medallions in the form of sun ornaments often found on roadside shrines. Norwegian[edit] The Norwegian Classroom Norwegian ClassroomLocationRoom 151DedicatedMay 15, 1948StyleFolk MotifArchitectGeorg Eliassen, Oslo The Norwegian Classroom was designed in Oslo in an 18th-century peasant style using Norwegian building techniques, painted decoration, and craftsmanship by architect Georg Eliassen just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Plans for the room were sent on the last ship to leave Petsamo for the United States where they were completed by University Architect Albert A. Klimcheck. Walls of the main space are paneled with vertical overlapping spruce boards hand-rubbed with wax. The walls in the front of the room are painted a soft blue and decorated with floral designs reminiscent of the 18th century rosemaling technique. Because living and bedrooms were often merged into one room during this era, two of the panels swing open as if they would reveal traditional built-in-beds, but instead conceal the blackboard. The room features high-sloped ceilings reflective of those in Nordic peasant homes that keep snow from accumulating during the severe winters. Spruce boards are laid in a herringbone pattern slanting upward to a plane of flat boards decorated by two hand-carved, painted rosettes with a symbol for the midnight sun. Wooden chandeliers bearing a painted design incorporating \"1945\", the year the room was opened, hang from the flat surfaces. The professor's section of the room has a low raftered ceiling. The transition between the two parts of the room is indicated by a corner kleberstone fireplace in which birch logs were burned standing on end to assure that smoke would rise up the chimney. Windows are of handmade opalescent glass tinted pale yellow. Since a bay window is not a Scandinavian tradition, the area is plastered, paved with slate, and treated as a traditional alcove. The student tablet armchairs are low-backed and the professor's chair is of a typical Viking design with carved heads of beasts and an intertwining dragon motif that traditionally serves as a symbol that protects against evil. The room features a century-old grandfather clock with an engraved dial and a case that is painted to match the wall decorations of the smaller room. Above the rear wall bench and flanked by corner display cabinets decorated with rosemaling, hangs a framed copy of a 1695 Norwegian woolen tapestry depicting the Biblical parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins[46] Philippine[edit] The Philippine Classroom Philippine ClassroomLocationRoom 313DedicatedJune 9, 2019ArchitectWarren Bulseco, U.S., and Melinda Minerva “Popi” Laudico, Philippines The Philippine Nationality Room[47] began construction on May 3, 2018, overcoming a prior hold on the project since 2011.[11][48] The design of the Philippine room is based on a traditional bahay na bato.[11] Meaning \"house of stone\", bahay na bato is a long-lasting type of home that became popular in the Philippines during the years of Spanish rule (mid-1500s to 1898). The room is particularly based on the interiors of the Quema House in the city of Vigan.[49] The Philippine Nationality Room was designed by Pittsburgh architect Warren Bulseco and Philippine architect Melinda Minerva “Popi” Laudico. Professor Fernando Zialcita, a noted authority on Philippine ancestral houses from Ateneo de Manila University, served as adviser to the project. Filipino-American artist Eliseo Art Silva created paintings for the room. The room features lattice-patterned windows using capiz shells, a popular alternative to glass in the Philippines. The chairs are backed with solihiya, rattan woven into a sunburst pattern. An etched silver Murano mirror from Europe and a bronze chandelier from the United States highlight the role of imported design in Filipino culture. Other artifacts showcase pre-Colonial cultures. The Golden Tara is a Hindu sculpture viewed by the Manobo tribe as a protective nature spirit. The Manunggul Jar, excavated from a Neolithic burial site in Palawan, depicts human figures traveling in a boat to the afterlife. The room's ceremonial key, designed by Christopher Purpura, incorporates mythological figures from the Meranao people of Mindanao—the serpent Naga and the bird Sarimanok. Polish[edit] The Polish Classroom Polish ClassroomLocationRoom 126DedicatedFebruary 16, 1940Style16th-century Polish RenaissanceArchitectA. Szyszko-Bohusz, Kraków The Polish Classroom was inspired by rooms in Kraków's Wawel Castle, for centuries the residence of kings. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, and the science that his theories revolutionized, are also a major theme of the room. A replica of the famous Jan Matejko portrait of Copernicus shows him as a young man pursuing his study of the universe from a workshop on the roof of his uncle's house in Allenstein (Olsztyn). In the bay stands an enlarged replica of the 16th-century Jagiellonian globe, one of the oldest existing globes to depict North America as a separate continent. The original globe was only eight inches high and was designed to operate as a clock and calendar. It took a metalsmith in Kraków five years to complete the large globe in this room. Artists from Kraków also came to Pittsburgh to paint the ceiling of 18-foot (5.5 m) beams with informal geometric Renaissance decorations. The room is illuminated by a bronze chandelier bearing a stylized Polish eagle. The walnut seminar table was copied from one in a state dining room at Wawel Castle. The windows combine hexagonal handmade roundels, similar to those in Wawel Castle, with stained-glass coats of arms representing Polish institutions of higher education. The cornerstone is a fragment of Gothic cornice preserved from the Collegium Maius (1369), the ancient Jagiellonian Library. Poland's music is represented by the original manuscript of Ignace Paderewski's only opera, Manru, which is displayed in the archive cabinet. Romanian[edit] The Romanian Classroom Romanian ClassroomLocationRoom 130DedicatedMay 16, 1943Style17th century ByzantineArchitectN. Ghica-Budeşti, Bucharest The Romanian Classroom was designed in Bucharest by Nicolae Ghica-Budeşti. The carved doorframe is characteristic of stone thresholds of Romanian monasteries and is made is of American limestone selected due to its similarity to Romanian limestone used in the royal palace at Bucharest. The entrance door of the Romanian Classroom is ornately carved oak reminiscent of Byzantine churches in Romania. The words of Vasile Alecsandri, one of the greatest Romanian poets of the 19th century, are carved overhead in the stone door frame from his Ode to the Year 1855: \"The Romanian is like the mighty rock which amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea forever remains unmoved.\" The floor is laid in square blocks of pink marble imported from quarries at Ruşchiţa. The black boards are set in arched oak panels, carved in a manner of icon screens in Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Romanian churches. These are separated by carved-twisted rope which suggests the Roman origin of many of Romania's artistic traditions. Ancient original icons from Romania depicting the Virgin and Child, Christ, the Dormition of the Virgin, and Saint Mark are embedded in the upper section of each panel. White arca paint mixed with color gives the smooth plastered walls a bluish pink tint. A Byzantine-style mosaic embedded in the rear wall, a gift of the Romanian government, was executed by Bucharest ceramicist Nora Steriade in gold, turquoise, bronze, ruby red, and black pieces of glass, and was originally part of the Romanian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.[50] The lettering for the inscription and for the entrance text is the work of Alexander Seceni. The mosaic depicts Constantin Brâncoveanu, Prince of Wallachia, who refused to recant the Christian faith even at the cost of his own life and the lives of the male members of his family. The six windows have rounded Romanesque heads reflecting tradition brought from Rome when they conquered the original Dacian settlers in 106 AD. Two small window casements are deeply recessed and have marble window ledges. The four large center windows, form an alcove shut off from the main part of the room by an iron grilled gates wrought in Romania and hung in an arch. These gates swing back in folded sections against the plastered wall. A slab of polished marble tops the wrought-iron radiator grille. Yellow silk draperies frame the windows and ancient icons befitting the season and holidays are exhibited in the alcove which is reminiscent of an icon shrine in an Orthodox Church. The student chairs are of dark oak hand-carved by Romanian peasant artisans using simple pocketknives and each splat bears a different design. The professor's reading desk was adapted from an Eastern Orthodox Church lectern.[51] Russian[edit] The Russian Classroom Russian ClassroomLocationRoom 153DedicatedJuly 8, 1938StyleByzantine and Folk MotifsDesignerAndrey Avinoff, Tultchin The Russian Classroom contains folk ornamentation with traditional motifs from Byzantium, the spiritual center of Russia. The seminar table is made of oak slabs matched in contrasting grain and held together by ornamental keys. The cut-out apron is characteristic of massive tables in the Vologda district. The back of each student's chair has a cruciform circle pattern surmounted by triangles carved with symbols of regional or stylistic significance including the reindeer which symbolizes the tundra and the sturgeon that represents the Volga River. The professor's chair has a back of spirals surmounted by two peacocks worshipping the tree of life. The podium is ecclesiastic in character and suggests the analoi used in Orthodox churches to support heavy Bibles. The blackboard is patterned after a triptych, or three-leafed frame which holds icons. The doors of the blackboard are a grille of wooden spirals backed by red velvet. Above them is a carved panel with Sirin and Alcanost, the twin birds of Russian folklore that depict joy and sorrow as indistinguishable. A dado or low wainscot of simple horizontal oaken boards surrounds the room and incorporates the blackboard, the corner cupboard, and kiot which is a Slavic term for a wall frame treated as a piece of furniture. Within the kiot hangs a vishivka (appliqué and embroidery) banner of Saint George, patron saint of Moscow since the 15th century. The banner was made with pieces of 16th and 17th century fabric from Venice and Paris and is an example of needlework once popular with the Russian aristocracy. The words \"Valorous youth victorious over forces of evil and darkness\" are carved in both Russian and English below the banner. A copy of the Avinoff family icon in the room depicts the miraculous saving of the city of Kitej from a Tartar invasion in the 14th century. The ceiling is cornered with designs resembling those used to form traditional Easter cakes and which symbolize the four seasons, with a bud for Spring, a sunflower for summer, grapes for Autumn, and a pine cone for Winter. A wrought iron chandelier was created by Russian-born Hyman Blum. Following a visit from Dmitry Medvedev in 2009, a display cabinet with carved ornamentation matching the rooms original carvings was installed to house three gifts presented by the then Russian President.[52] Scottish[edit] The Scottish Classroom Scottish ClassroomLocationRoom 139DedicatedJuly 8, 1938Style17th centuryArchitectReginald Fairlie, Edinburgh The Scottish Classroom was designed by Reginald Fairlie of Edinburgh in the period style of the early 17th century. The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English pollard oak. The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include David Livingstone who was an African missionary and explorer, Robert Louis Stevenson who authored Treasure Island, and Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin. The inscriptions above the doors and the rear cabinet are from \"The Brus\" by the 14th-century Scottish poet John Barbour. The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire. A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard was taken from the Cowgate in Edinburgh and is known as \"the Scottish Golden Rule\" which reads: \"Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would.\" The plaster frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at Elcho Castle in Perthshire and incorporates symbols of 14 Scottish clans which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the Leslie Clan. The thistle, Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life. The overmantel of the Scottish sandstone fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet Robert Burns that is copied from an original by Alexander Nasmyth which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland. Above the portrait is the cross of St. Andrew, Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried heather are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to Edinburgh Castle and represent the 13th-century patriot Sir William Wallace and the 14th century freedom fighter, Robert the Bruce, both of whom were popularized in the movie Braveheart. Medallions in the bay windows represent the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: Glasgow, St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh. The medallions in the front and rear windows are of Elgin and Melrose Abbeys which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning. The draperies are of crewel-embroidered linen. The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron coronet in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of Bannockburn at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314. Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to John Knox. An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand. The rear cabinet, based on an aumbry or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as pewter and china used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh. The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of Philadelphia. Wrought ironwork was done by Samuel Yellin. Cut into stone above the doorways are the thistle and the Lion Rampant, the Scottish emblem incorporated into Britain's royal arms. The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was Jock Sutherland.[53][54] Swedish[edit] Swedish Nationality Room. Swedish ClassroomLocationRoom 135DedicatedJuly 8, 1938StyleFolk MotifArchitectLinton R. WilsonAdviserCarl Milles, Stockholm The Swedish Classroom reflects a peasant cottage and contains murals painted by Olle Nordmark. The special glory of the room is the rear wall paintings. The inspiration for the four framed paintings came from painted panels done by the 18th-century painter from Hälsingland, Gustav Reuter. Linton Wilson found the panels at the Nordic Museum.[55] The hooded brick fireplace derives from an original in the Bollnäs Cottage in Skansen, the famous outdoor museum in Stockholm. The brilliant white walls and fireplace are constructed of 200-year-old handmade bricks. The fire tools were handwrought by Ola Nilsson, a Swedish blacksmith. He reconstructed tools used in his childhood home in Sweden.[56] A subtle sense of humor associated with the Swedish people is revealed in the room's paintings. A wall fresco secco depicts the Three Wise Men dressed as cavaliers riding to Bethlehem, in two directions. In their midst is Sweden's patron saint, St. Catherine. The sloped ceiling bears decorations in which the central figure is the Archangel Gabriel, seen as a droll trumpeter with two left feet. Nearby are renditions of Justice and Knowledge surrounded by groupings of flowers. Justice uses her blindfold to hold scales that appear balanced but have an off-center fulcrum. Knowledge seems puzzled as she contemplates writing on her slate with a quill pen. Furniture and woodwork are the work of Erik Jansson of Philadelphia.[55] The classroom's oak furniture is stained a muted gray-blue tone, similar to that found in old Swedish homes. Floral designs, in colors that complement the amber tone of fir wall benches, brighten the door and archive cabinet. The red brick floor is set in a herringbone pattern. Swiss[edit] Swiss Nationality Room Swiss ClassroomLocationRoom 321DedicatedApril 22, 2012StyleLate Medieval Style circa 1500DesignerJustin Rüssli, LucerneArchitectStephen Altherr The Swiss Classroom is modeled after a 15th-century room from Fraumunster Abbey displayed in the Swiss National Museum in Zurich, Switzerland.[57] The room is paneled in pine wood and features four white oak trestle tables and four display cases that represent the four languages of Switzerland: French, German, Italian, and Romansch. 26 country-style chairs contain painted carvings of the symbols of Switzerland's cantons that form the Swiss Confederation which united in 1291. The furniture and woodwork were crafted by Richard Sink of French Creek, WV.[57] A centerpiece of the room is a reproduction of a cocklestove that is modeled on a H.H. Graaf family oven on display in Schloss Wülflingen Castle, Winterthur. The cocklestove's ornate tiles contain several painted Swiss motifs that including various animals, plants, edelweiss, the heraldic emblem of the Graaf family, and a depiction of the Swiss legend of William Tell.[58] Windows are leaded and feature three stained-glass shields of the original Swiss cantons as well as the Swiss Cross. The Swiss Cross is also displayed stone over the door, within the window of the door, and on the lectern which is modeled on a 17th-century schoolmaster's desk. A carved and painted frieze depicts Swiss flora and fauna and an antique map depicts Switzerland by its ancient Latin name of \"Helvetia\". Portraits on the back wall, done in the style of Hans Holbein the Younger, depict Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Wood beamed ceiling contains LED lights that are hidden behind rosettes.[14] Syria-Lebanon[edit] The Syria-Lebanon Room Syria-Lebanon RoomLocationRoom 160DedicatedJune 28, 1941Style18th century DamascusArchitectunrecorded Originally a library built in 1782 in a wealthy Damascan merchant's home, the Syria-Lebanon Room was moved intact to its location in the Cathedral of Learning following a six-year effort to fund and install the room by the Syrian and Lebanese communities in Pittsburgh. Because of the fragility and pricelessness of the furnishing, it has been closed for class use and is one of two display rooms. The linden-paneled walls and ceilings are decorated with \"gesso painting,\" a mixture of chalk and glue applied by brush in intricate relief, then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf. The room features a (now improperly oriented) mihrab with a stalactite vault traditionally housing the Koran and prayer rug. Set in the walls are book cabinets and display shelves.[59] The room is illuminated by an old mosque lamp of perforated copper with handblown glass wells that originally held oil, water, and wicks. The sofas, from the Arabic word \"suffah\", are covered in satin and rest on a dark red and white marble foundation. The marble floor slopes down at the entrance where visitors would remove their shoes before entering. In 1997, a glass-paneled French-style door to the room was added to allow the room to be visible from passers-by. The doors were patterned after a grille design found on the windows of the 18th century Ibn Room in the Islamic section of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.[60] Turkish[edit] The Turkish Classroom Turkish ClassroomLocationRoom 339DedicatedMarch 4, 2012StyleBaş Odası circa 1400ADDesignerÖmer AkınArchitectÖmer Akın and John Cleary The Turkish Nationality Room was based on a baş odası, or main room, of a typical Turkish house or hayat with an outer gallery and a side iwan. The iwan is intended to be used as an entrance area similar to the royal pavilion, annexed to the Yeni Mosque in the Eminönü district of Istanbul, which was built in 1663 for the use of Sultan Mehmet IV.[61] In the iwan of the Turkish Nationality Room, four ceramic panels, painted on clay tiles in Ankara, represent various cultures and points in Turkish history.[62] The largest ceramic is a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, who is depicted instructing the nation on the Turkish alphabet adopted in 1928. Other panels depict Uighur princesses, who represent the importance of women in circa 9th-century Turkish culture, a reproduction of \"Two merchants in conversation\" by Mehmed Siyah Kalem [tr] which signifies the appearance of realism in Turkish drawing around the 14th century; and a depiction of Suleiman the Magnificent at the circumcision ceremony of Şehzade Beyazıt and Şehzade Cihangir which represents the apex of Ottoman power and culture in the 16th century. The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimic divan-style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a \"parted curtain\" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house in Safranbolu, is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of the Topkapi Palace. The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century. Display cases contain historic examples of Turkish calligraphy, ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as an evil eye. The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the current flag of Turkey, adopted in 1936. Ukrainian[edit] The Ukrainian Classroom Ukrainian ClassroomLocationRoom 341DedicatedJune 17, 1990Style17th–18th century Ukrainian BaroqueDesignerLubomyr E. KalynychArchitectWalter R. Boykowycz, A.I.A. The Ukrainian Classroom is designed in Baroque style with richly carved wood, colorful ceramics, and intricate metalwork in this adaptation of a nobleman's reception room. The entrance has an archaic trapezoidal form with carved motifs of water (chevron), wheat, and sunflowers. The lintel inscription commemorates Ukraine's millennium of Christianity (988–1988). The stove tiles depict festival practices and daily life. A pokutia, or place of honor, is defined by the benches and the traditional icons of St. Nicholas, the Mother of God, Christ the Teacher, and St. George. The chalkboard doors bearing the Tree of Life are surmounted by three Cyrillic alphabets used in Ukraine in the 11th, 17th, and 19th centuries. On the right wall, a copper bas-relief depicts the development of Ukrainian culture over the millennia. It portrays cultural centers, historical figures, rituals, monuments, and the evolution of Ukrainian ornament. The massive crossbeam's elaborate carvings include a protective solar symbol and a quotation from Ukraine's bard Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861): \"Learn, my brothers! Think and read ... Learn foreign thoughts, but do not shun your own country!\" Beyond the wood posts, reminiscent of a gallery, the display case houses traditional Ukrainian art and crafts. Welsh[edit] The Welsh Classroom Welsh ClassroomLocationRoom 342DedicatedJune 1, 2008Style18th century Non-Conformist chapelArchitectMartin Powell, Katherine Horstman, Richard Freeman, Yaso Snyder The Welsh Classroom, was perhaps the longest in coming, as reservations for a Welsh room were originally requested in the 1930s.[63] The existing room, installed on the third floor of the Cathedral of Learning, is patterned after the Pen-rhiw Chapel at St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff and represents a traditional 18th-century Welsh chapel, which often became the center of village social life.[64] By that time, the English ruled the country and imposed law requiring English as the official language of the courts and churches. In order to worship and hold church services in their native Welsh language, and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by the Protestant Reformation, the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled chapel modeled in this Nationality Room. The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on a Welsh slate foundation opposite the main blue door. The clock, considered one of the most important furnishings in a Welsh home, has, instead of numbers, a painted square face that spells out \"Richard Thomas\" suggesting that he was both the maker and owner of the clock. The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation. At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days. Above the chalk board is the Lord's Prayer, written in Welsh.[65] Pew benches of pine face the lectern. Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of poplar and flooring suggests a typical chapel dirt floor. The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-time Welsh national symbol, represents the legendary victory of the Red Dragon over the White Dragon of numerous tales of medieval Welsh literature and represents the triumph of Good over Evil.[66][67][68] Yugoslav[edit] The Yugoslav Classroom Yugoslav ClassroomLocationRoom 142DedicatedMarch 31, 1939StyleFolk MotifArchitectVojta Braniš [hr], Zagreb The Yugoslav Classroom was designed by Professor Vojta Braniš [hr], a sculptor and director of the Industrial Art School in Zagreb. The walls are paneled in Slavonian oak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite with South Slavs. This type of work, known as \"notch-carving\", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants. On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of Eastern Empire of Byzantium and Western Empire of Rome along with the founding dates of the universities in Belgrade, Ljubljana, and Zagreb. The ceiling is carved with intricate Croatian, Slovenian, and Serbian folk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in the White Palace in Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design. At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, \"Post-War Motherhood\", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war. In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of the Madonna of Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers of Sveta Gora in order to replace a priceless painting during World War I.[69] The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares. Above the paneled walls, six portraits depict prominent Yugoslavs. On the front wall are portraits of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864) who compiled the Serbian dictionary and collected, edited, and published Serbian national ballads and folk songs; and Croatian statesman Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer (1815–1905) who was known for his efforts to achieve understanding between the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, founder of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts). On the corridor wall are likenesses of Baron George von Vega (1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in the Austrian army and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; and Petar Petrović Njegoš (1813–1851), the last prince-bishop of Montenegro, who was celebrated for his poetry. Represented on the rear wall are Rugjer Bošković (1711–1787), a Ragusan scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; and France Prešeren (1800–1849) who is considered the greatest Slovenian classical poet. The Yugoslav Classroom's executive committee was first organized in 1926 under the chairmanship of Anton Gazdić, the president of the Croatian Fraternal Union. After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer. Famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović was a great supporter of the Classroom and gave two of his works to the university, one a bust of Mihajlo Pupin and the other a self-portrait.[70] The Classroom was designed to portray the culture and traditions of the Yugoslavs, who were considered as inhabitants of the various Yugoslavian regions: Croatians, Dalmatians, Slavonians, Slovenians, Serbians, Bosnians and Montenegrins.[71] Proposed rooms[edit] The university has two additional Nationality Room Committees which are in various stages of fund raising and room design.[11][72][73] Proposed rooms include the following: Finnish[74] Iranian[75] Thai[76] Prior projects for Danish,[77][78] Latin American, Moroccan, and Caribbean[79] rooms have been discontinued.[11] Gallery[edit] Austrian Room Chinese Room Czechoslovak Room Hidden upstairs bedroom of the Early American Room German Room Hungarian Room Italian Room Scottish Room Swiss Room Turkish Classroom Yugoslav Room Russian President Dmitry Medvedev meets with students in the Russian Room on September 24, 2009.

PCA provides a venue for the community to create, see, support, and learn about visual arts. Founded in 1945, PCA is located at 6300 Fifth Avenue in the Shadyside neighborhood.[3] Though, according to the City of Pittsburgh Map, the center is located in the Point Breeze neighborhood.[4][5] Pop artist Keith Haring had his first exhibition at the Pittsburgh Arts and Crafts Center in 1978 before moving to New York City and becoming one of the most prolific artists of the late 20th century.[6] History[edit] Founding[edit] The PCA's opened on March 17, 1945, as the \"Arts and Craft Center\" at Fifth and Shady Avenues.[7] Almost 1000 Pittsburghers gathered at the opening night ceremonies, headed by Mayor Cornelius D. Scully, J. Bailey Ellis, who was named chairman of the Center, and Mrs. Charles D. Marshall, who publicly turned the key to her home over to the city. Ten artist groups comprised the center at its founding: Pittsburgh Drama League (founded 1913) Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen (founded 1944) Weavers Guild of Pittsburgh (founded 1940) Society of Sculptors (founded 1934) Pittsburgh Civic Ballet (founded 1941) Abstract Artists Group of Pittsburgh Musician's Club of Pittsburgh (founded 1913) Associated Artists of Pittsburgh (founded 1910) Contemporary Dance Group Authors’ Club (founded 1918). The first program after the grand opening was a musicale given by the Musician's Club on March 25, 1945. Each of the ten groups was responsible for holding five programs open to the public each year. The first Christmas Bazaar was held in November 1946, and continues today as the Holiday Sale. The organization was chartered in July 1947. The first annual meeting to which all members of the various artist groups were invited was held on January 12, 1948. The newly revised by-laws were read and accepted. The elected board and officers were unpaid. The center's dedication to improving the overall quality of life in Pittsburgh through education has been an essential part of its philosophy from the beginning. The first mention of classes appeared in the minutes of the June 1947 board meeting. University of Pittsburgh professor Walter Hovey, then president of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, asked for the use of the kitchen in order to hold a jewelry class for some 40 students. In addition to education, the center has always sought to promote regional art. In 1948, the first Everyman's Art Show was held, open to the region's amateurs. The first Artist of the Year show was held in January 1949, honoring painter Balcombe Greene. In the April 1954, the Center went on the air on WQED-TV with the weekly, half-hour series You, the Artists hosted by sculptor Everett Sturgeon. From 1981 to 1989, the center renewed its relationship with WQED with the weekly Lyceum (later Studio 13,) hosted by Mary Rawson. Ongoing attempts were made in print as well, starting from the earliest days with a mimeographed newsletter, Musings, from 1975-79 with Quidnunc, and later in expanded course catalogs and the quarterly Art Lines. Reorganizing[edit] Eventually, volunteers could not keep abreast of an increasingly complex artistic and organizational environment. By the late 1960s, the center's administration resembled “an octopus without a head,” according to the Pittsburgh Press's Patricia Lowry. Artist Danny Butts was engaged as the center's first full-time director. He was succeeded by businessman Jerrold Rouby in 1970. Additional paid positions were added then: an education director and sales director. The Center's classes and enrollment expanded during Rouby's tenure. In 1975, Audrey Bethel became the center's director. Under her leadership, the groundwork was laid for many changes. Nationally known artists visited the center, the board of directors was restructured, and the center's name was changed. Cheryl Towers became director in 1981, and later hired ceramicist Sande Deitch as full-time exhibitions director. Deitch became director of the Center in 1987; Murray Horne became exhibitions director. Post-1990s[edit] Kim Beck, Pittsburgh Center of the Arts Emerging Artist 2006 Charcoal on paper For the center, the late 1990s were marked with ambitious programs, but also financial difficulty. In February 2002, five staff—including Executive Director Laura Willumsen and Curator Vicky Clark—were laid off and the exhibitions department eliminated. In August 2004, 13 staff members were laid off. The center was approximately $1 million in debt, and its doors were closed. The center has offered special prizes of Artist of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year, along with its Biennial exhibitions of local contemporary artists. Previous winners of prizes include Delanie Jenkins, Clayton Merrill, and George Anastasios Magalios. In September 2004, Charlie Humphrey became the unpaid interim director of PCA. The center reopened, after having been closed only for a few weeks. In relatively short order, missed payments to artists were rectified and relationships with foundations were repaired. In January 2006, following votes by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers membership, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts board and Pittsburgh Filmmakers board, the merger of the two organizations became final. The Pittsburgh Filmmakers by-laws were carried over as the by-laws of the merged organization. In Fall 2010, the combined Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts entered into merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center.[8] By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations.[8] Facilities[edit] Throughout the years many renovations were made at both the Marshall building, which houses the galleries, and the Scaife building, which houses the school. The last major renovation was to the Marshall building, which reopened March 24, 1990 with a dedication by Mayor Sophie Masloff to 800 guests, including Jane Marshall Fisher, granddaughter of the building's original donor. The center has a campus arrangement of four buildings, three of which (two mansions and a carriage house) are rented from the city for $1.00 per year. The fourth structure houses newly built kilns. PCA buildings[edit] For the industrialists in the early 1900s, a major living area was Pittsburgh's East End, where a building boom was underway. A parade of mansions were commissioned along Fifth Avenue to what became known as “Millionaires Row” for some of the wealthiest and most celebrated families in Pittsburgh, such as the Mellons, the Benedums, and the Fricks. In 1909, one of the most impressive mansions built was the 65-room Richard Beatty Mellon House on the 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land bordering Fifth Avenue, Shady Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard on what is now known as Mellon Park. Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife Jennie King Mellon raised two children, Sarah Cordelia King Mellon and Richard King Mellon. Jennie King Mellon had a love for flowers and had two very large flower gardens facing Beechwood Boulevard, which still exists in Mellon Park today. Next to the mansion was a garage and carriage house, which housed servants on the second floor. This carriage house was donated to the City and is now the Phipps Garden Center. The 65-room mansion was torn down in 1941. In 1904, there was another earlier Tudor revival mansion built on the Mellon Estate. It was given as a wedding gift in 1927 to Richard Beatty's daughter Sarah, who married Alan Magee Scaife, fifth generation industrialist and the Director of Mellon National Bank. In February 1946, the Scaifes also donated their home and property to the City. This mansion is now the Scaife Building that houses the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts School. Next door to the Mellon Estate, on the corner of Fifth and Shady Avenues, Charles D. Marshall, president and co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, which later became Bethlehem Steel, built his mansion. Completed in 1912, the Marshall mansion was an impressive formal 17th-Century Carolean-inspired building. In 1943, Charles Marshall also donated his house at 6300 Fifth Avenue to the city. The city was responsible for only the exterior maintenance. The Marshall mansion became the Arts and Crafts Center of Pittsburgh in 1945. In 1980, the name was again changed to what is now known as the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. External links[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.

It has features works by Paul Joseph Stankard and classes taught by Dante Marioni, Davide Salvadore, and Cesare Toffolo.[3] The origins of the Pittsburgh Glass Center date to 1991, when David Stephens, then visual-arts officer of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, approached glass artists Ron Desmett and Kathleen Mulcahy, then a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, about the idea of a center for studio glass.[3] It was originally to have been the Elizabeth Glass Center in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.[4] However, by 1999, the plans had changed and the center was re-oriented to Pittsburgh.[4] It was officially opened in 2001.[1] The current facility in Friendship is LEED-certified.[5] Its development has aided the growth of Garfield, especially with the adjacent Glass Lofts residential development.[5] In fall 2010, the Pittsburgh Glass Center entered into talks with Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.[6] By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations.[6] In 2012, the Glass Center purchased residential housing adjacent to its main gallery space to be used as student and artist-in-residence housing.[7] By 2012, the center had a $1 million budget, with 10 full-time employees.[5] References[edit] ^ a b c \"About Us\". pittsburghglasscenter.org.

It is widely regarded as one of America's most colorful public art landmarks.[2][3] Randy Gilson is the founder of this museum, which showcases found object art.[4] Randyland has played an important role in the cultural rejuvenation of Pittsburgh, with its neighbors City of Asylum and Mattress Factory.[5][6][7] Randyland has received international attention through viral listicles, and[8][9] is among the most photographed places on Instagram.[10] History[edit] Randy Gilson talking to visitors at RandylandRandy Gilson was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved to Pittsburgh's Northside in 1982, where he was a community activist, planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens.[11] His guerrilla gardening planted vacant lots in Manchester, the Mexican War Streets, and surrounding neighborhoods.[12] He bought the property that would become Randyland on a credit card for $10,000 in 1995.[13] Using upcycling, Gilson decorates his home with items such as mannequins, plastic dinosaurs and pink flamingos. The fences display murals with neighbors dancing and smiling.[14] In late 2016, Gilson's partner David Paul Francis \"Mac\" McDermott was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.[15] Upon hearing the news, Randyland fans raised over $20,000 and sent Gilson and McDermott on their first vacation. The couple visited the Grand Canyon and Hollywood.[16] Afterwards, Gilson retired from his restaurant job to spend more time with the ailing McDermott. Following the announcement, Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director.[11][15][17] The neighborhood around the museum experienced explosive growth in 2016-2019.[18] Randyland itself reportedly doubled in attendance.[19] The courtyard was overhauled to accommodate the traffic. Under Conner's curation, the facility embraced being a selfie museum as a vibrant backdrop for photos.[20] McDermott died on January 10, 2019.[19] As Gilson's partner, he was posthumously given the title of co-founder. Journalists noted that McDermott may have downplayed his role when alive but was a backbone of the museum.[21] Later that year, Randyland received the Mayor's Award for Public Art for 2019. Conner left the museum early 2020.[20] Because it is outdoors, Randyland was one of the only art museums open in Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] Gilson came out of retirement. The Courtyard was changed to a socially distanced playground throughout quarantine. Many of the original murals have been painted over. As of 2022, Randyland is still a free and popular tourist attraction.[22][23] Exhibits[edit] The Courtyard of Randyland Outside Celebration Mural Randyland Welcome Wall Randyland Mirror Wall Outdoor Living Room In popular culture[edit] The documentary The Spirit of Pittsburgh features Randy Gilson's gardening alongside Fred Rogers.[24] The documentary Pursuing Happiness features Randy Gilson as one of the happiest people in America.[25] When a blizzard postponed Guster's Pittsburgh concert, they instead recorded a viral music video in the alleyway near Randyland.[26][27] Randy Gilson succeeded Rick Sebak as the Mardi Gras King of Pittsburgh.[28][29] A teenager's \"Summer Bucket List 2017\", which included Randyland as a place to visit, went viral.[30][31] Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown calls Randyland an essential for the \"Perfect Day in Pittsburgh\".[32] The popular travel show Rediscovering America presented by Barstool Sports interviewed Randy Gilson at Randyland in their 2022 episode about Pittsburgh.

For the band, see Art Brut (band). Adolf Wölfli's Irren-Anstalt Band-Hain, 1910 Anna Zemánková, No title, 1960s Outsider art is art made by self-taught individuals who are untrained and untutored in the traditional arts with typically little or no contact with the conventions of the art worlds. The term outsider art was coined in 1972 as the title of a book by art critic Roger Cardinal.[1] It is an English equivalent for art brut (French: [aʁ bʁyt], \"raw art\" or \"rough art\"), a label created in the 1940s by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture. Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples psychiatric hospital patients, hermits, and spiritualists.[2][3] Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual Outsider Art Fair[4] has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes applied as a marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream \"art world\" or \"art gallery system\", regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.[5] A more specific term, \"outsider music\", was later adapted for musicians. Art of the mentally ill[edit] See also: Creativity and mental illness Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with that of children and the makers of \"peasant art\", developed from the end of the 19th century onward, both by psychiatrists such as Cesare Lombroso, Auguste Marie or Marcel Réjà, and by artists, such as members of \"Der Blaue Reiter\" group: Wassily Kandinsky, August Macke, Franz Marc, Alexej von Jawlensky, and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, Der Blaue Reiter Almanac. During World War I, Macke was killed at Champagne in 1914 and Marc was killed at Verdun in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by Paul Klee, who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives'. Interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. Walter Morgenthaler published his book Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) about Adolf Wölfli, a psychotic mental patient in his care. Wölfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. Wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the Adolf Wölfli Foundation in the Museum of Fine Art, Bern. A defining moment was the publication of Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) in 1922, by Hans Prinzhorn. This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Jean Dubuffet.[6] People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, William Kurelek, later awarded the Order of Canada for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia.[7] In the hospital he painted, producing The Maze, a dark depiction of his tortured youth.[8] He was transferred from the Maudsley to Netherne Hospital from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with Edward Adamson (1911–1996), a pioneer of art therapy, and creator of the Adamson Collection. Jean Dubuffet and art brut[edit] View inside the Collection de l'art brut museum, Lausanne French artist Jean Dubuffet was particularly struck by Bildnerei der Geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art, which he called art brut or raw art. In 1948 he formed the Compagnie de l'Art Brut along with other artists, including André Breton and Claude Lévi-Strauss.[9] The collection he established became known as the Collection de l'art brut and the curator was Slavko Kopač for almost three decades.[10] It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in Lausanne, Switzerland. Dubuffet characterized art brut as: Those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses – where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere – are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade. — Jean Dubuffet, \"Place à l'incivisme\" (December 1987 – February 1988).[11] Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated. Dubuffet's championing of Art Brut would not last long. Scholars argue Dubuffet's distaste for the mainstream art world helped ensure that art brut and the Compagnie de l'Art Brut would not survive on a commercial basis. Dubuffet would kill art brut as he defined it in his quest for its authenticity.[9] Three years after the Compagnie de l'Art Brut was formed, Dubuffet dissolved it, caving in to form the more conventional Collection de l'art brut afterward.[9] Cultural context[edit] The interest in \"outsider\" practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to Cubism and the Dada, Constructivist, and Futurist movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, for example, abandoned \"painterly\" technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to recontextualize existing \"ready-made\" objects as art. Mid-century artists, including Pablo Picasso, looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of what they deemed \"primitive\" societies, the unschooled art made by children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the art brut – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values. As with analysis of these other art movements, current discourse indicates art brut is innately tied to primitivism[9][12] due to its similarity in its borrowing of personal \"de-patriation\" and exoticization of familiar yet alien forms. Terminology[edit] Two images of Joe Minter's African Village in America, a half-acre visionary art environment in Birmingham, Alabama. Scenes include African warriors watching their descendants’ struggles in Alabama, tributes to black scientists and military leaders, recreations of the epic civil rights confrontations in Alabama, and biblical scenes. A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as \"outside\" of official culture. Definitions of these terms vary and overlap.[13] The editors of Raw Vision, a leading journal in the field, suggest that \"Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary\". Consequently, they lament the use of \"outsider artist\" to refer to almost any untrained artist. \"It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name.\" Art Brut: Coined by Jean Dubuffet, the term translated literally from French means \"raw art\".[2][3] 'Raw' is analogous in that it has not been through the academic 'cooking' process: i.e. the world of art schools, galleries, and museums. Dubuffet's original definition pertains strictly to the ‘raw art’ created by the autodidactic and shunned fringes of society.[9] Folk art: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe – though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society's mainstream. Intuitive art/Visionary art: Raw Vision Magazine's preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, visionary art, unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art. The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art. Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as Neuve Invention; refers to artists on the margins of the art world. Naïve art: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to \"normal\" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists. Neuve invention: Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too; strictly speaking, it refers only to a special part of the Collection de l'art brut. Visionary environments: Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists – ranging from decorated houses to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, Buddha Park and Sala Keoku by Bunleua Sulilat, and The Palais idéal by Ferdinand Cheval.

The neighborhood has one of the City of Pittsburgh's largest concentrations of 19th-century homes, which has prompted outsiders to call the neighborhood the City's Georgetown.[4] It includes many bars and restaurants as well as residences. The main throughway in the South Side Flats is East Carson Street. The street is home to a significant portion of Pittsburgh's nightlife. History[edit] The South Side was once composed of a number of smaller communities. These included Birmingham and East Birmingham, both named for the English Midlands industrial center, Birmingham; Ormsby, originally a part of East Birmingham, incorporated as a borough in 1866; South Pittsburgh, the area immediately adjacent to the Smithfield Street Bridge, and Monongahela, named for the adjacent Monongahela River. These boroughs were collectively annexed to the city in 1872.[5] The South Side and much of the hillsides to its south had been granted to Major John Ormsby in 1763, in recognition for his assistance in the building of Fort Pitt. By the 1770s, Ormsby had built an estate on these lands and established a ferry for connecting his home with the community in Pittsburgh. In 1811, Ormsby's son-in-law, Dr. Nathaniel Bedford, laid out a town on the flats, naming it Birmingham in tribute to his native city. Bedford had come to Pittsburgh around 1770 and was the first practicing physician in the district known as Allegheny County.[6] He named the streets after his Ormsby's children; names which the South Side streets still bear—Mary, Jane, Sarah, Sidney. Carson St. was named after a sea captain who lived in Philadelphia and was a friend of Dr. Bedford. In the early days it was part of the Washington Pike, the main road to Washington, Pennsylvania. The nearby municipality of Mount Oliver would be named for John Ormsby's son Oliver Ormsby. The two areas were once connected by a coal incline run by the Keeling Coal Company, now the site of South Side Park. Birmingham quickly became a sizable industrial center because of the easy access to river and rail transport. The region would first become a center of glass production, followed by a concentration of iron and steel manufacturing. In 1850, Benjamin Franklin Jones invested in a South Side iron works. During the depression of 1873, he formed a partnership with a banker, James H. Laughlin. The firm of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company would eventually become the South Side's largest employer. By 1910, it would employ over 15,000 workers. The expansion of the plant in 1950 would require the demolition of residential homes between 31st and 33rd streets.[7] The majority of workers who had settled in the area were immigrants of Eastern Europe. They found home throughout the Flats and Slopes of South Side and had brought much of their culture and traditions to the area. Many of the Eastern European churches, clubs and bars are still present in the South Side. The decline of the steel industry was a major blow to the neighborhood. In addition to layoffs at the J&L Plant, the Levinson Steel Company which had been located on the South Side closed in 1981.[8] The facility had been located along the river between 19th to 21st streets, and was later converted into a strip mall. A series of arsons hit the South Side neighborhood in the early 1980s.[9] Prominent buildings on the corner of 18th and Carson Streets and the Arcade Theater on Carson St. were also demolished by fire.[10] The Arcade Theater had opened in 1929 and was the first theatre outside of Downtown Pittsburgh to have sound and air-conditioning.[11] The early 1980s saw the beginnings of redevelopment on the South Side. The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation helped establish and partner with the South Side Local Development Company in 1982. In 1985, the South Side's East Carson Street was selected to participate in the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Urban Demonstration Program. Community involvement played a major role in the redevelopment of the former J&L site. The Jones and Laughlin Company had merged with the Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) Corporation in 1974. The company would merge its J&L Steel subsidiary with Republic Steel to form LTV Steel in 1984. The South Side J&L/LTV plant shut down in 1986. Once closed, City of Pittsburgh Councilman Otis Lyon wanted the site's Bessemer converter building, an open hearth building, four smokestacks, and a J&L sign to be preserved. The plan fell through when it was determined that these structures posed a safety hazard, although the J&L sign is mothballed beneath the Panhandle Bridge for future use. Riverboat gambling was considered for the site and in 1993, and the City of Pittsburgh Urban and Redevelopment Authority (URA) purchased the site with money loaned by a potential developer for $9.3 million.[12] The URA eventually redeveloped the site to be the Southside Works complex. The project has brought national retailers to the eastern end of the neighborhood.[13] Geography[edit] The South Side Flats is located at 40°25′43.76″N 79°59′8.08″W and covers 0.936 square miles (2.42 km2).[1] The South Side Riverfront Park runs the majority of the border of the Flats to the Monongahela River. It hosts a myriad of events, like the annual Pittsburgh Dragon Boat Festival.[14] The Three Rivers Heritage Trail also runs through the park. Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods[edit] The east-west section of the South Side Flats are bordered by the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of South Shore to the west and South Side Slopes to the south. The Flats then curve to follow a north-south direction; this segment is bordered by the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Arlington to the west and a very small section of Baldwin to the south. The Flats run adjacent to three Pittsburgh neighborhoods across the Monongahela River and are directly linked via bridges. The Birmingham Bridge connects the Flats with the Bluff to the west. The north end of the Hot Metal Bridge connects the Flats with South Oakland to the northeast (left turn at end of bridge) and Hazelwood to the east (right turn).[15] Demographics[edit] Historical populationYearPop.±%194022,476— 195017,942−20.2%196012,586−29.9%19709,260−26.4%19807,894−14.8%19906,177−21.8%20005,726−7.3%20106,597+15.2%[16][17]Source: University of Pittsburgh[18] According to the 2000 census,[1] there were 5,726 people living in the neighborhood and 3,613 total housing units within its boundaries. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 95.2% White, 2.6% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.2% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 1.3% of the population. Out of the total number of housing units, 86.7% were occupied. There were 9.2% of households with those under the age of 18 and 31.0% with those over the age of 65. The population of the South Side Flats increased from 2000 to 2010, and much of the demographics did as well as a result of gentrification. Households with those over the age of 65 decreased from 31% in 2000 to just 11.8% in 2010.[19] According to the 2010 census,[19] there were 6,597 people living in the neighborhood and 4,326 total housing units within its boundaries. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 93.0% White, 3.0% African American, 0.1% Native American, 2.2% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.4% from other races, and 1.2% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 2.5% of the population. Out of the total number of housing units, 87.3% were occupied. 66.8% were renter occupied units, while nearly half of the vacant properties were listed for rent or rented but not occupied.[19] Trivia[edit] Kaufmanns Department Store was founded as a tailor shop on Carson St. on the South Side in 1871.[20] The South Side had the first electric railway in the City of Pittsburgh. The line started at 13th and Carson and traveled to Mount Oliver Borough.[21] The base of the Knoxville Incline was at 12th Street on the South Side. The incline was built in 1890, had an 18-degree curve, and was the longest incline ever built in Pittsburgh.[22] Gallery[edit] Bedford School, built in 1850, at 910 Bingham Street.

In 2020, CC relocated from The Strip District to its permanent location on Butler Street in the Lawrenceville neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The organization offers exhibitions focusing on multi-cultural diversity and social justice.,[1] artist-led, hands-on workshops, and a store featuring handcrafted art objects by artists from across the United States. CC is free admission and open to the public. Between three and four exhibits are displayed annually in CC's main gallery and bring in approximately 35,000 visitors.[citation needed] Another 100,000 visit the Satellite Gallery at One Mellon Center that was opened in 1990. This second gallery is located in the Pittsburgh Steel Plaza T-station and allows those working downtown the opportunity to experience art.[2][3] CC is nonprofit, aiming to bring arts to the community.[citation needed] It provides as much free access and programs as possible. In addition to the current exhibits and various studio workshops, CC reaches out into the community and focuses on at-risk youth, seniors in assisted living, and those living in homeless shelters.[4] History[edit] CC was founded in 1971 by Elizabeth Rockwell Raphael[5][6] in the belief that contemporary artists had new things to say with traditional materials, and that they needed wider opportunities to exhibit and sell their work. Since then, CC has organized more than 230 exhibitions and has established a satellite gallery[7] and a permanent collection. CC also offers a range of studio classes, community outreach programs, and a retail store. Elizabeth “Betty” Rockwell Raphael, who has been called one of the most groundbreaking women in the arts[2] was the first to transform the Pittsburgh arts scene. Before its foundation in 1971, Raphael opened a small art gallery in 1941 making the first modern art gallery Pittsburgh had ever seen. She introduced a new vision of art to the city and created what is now one of the only organizations in the country that focuses solely on craft media.[7] In 2010, CC was named a \"Champion in Action\" in the community arts category by Citizens Bank and WPXI-TV, and received a $25,000 grant for “offering cutting-edge exhibitions focused on multicultural diversity and non-mainstream art, as well as a range of classes and community outreach programs,” said Ralph J, Papa, Chairman of Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania.[4] In 2018, CC received the Award of Distinction from American Craft Council. This award recognizes an organization, institution, corporation, or individual who has made significant contributions to the field of craft with a minimum of 25 years of service.[8] CC was the first organization to receive this award in Pittsburgh, PA.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ \"The Society for Contemporary Craft\".

It is the largest memorial in the United States that is dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel. History and notable features[edit] This historic building was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic during the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County residents to honor the dwindling ranks of American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as a Union Army mustering ground during the war. The memorial now represents all branches of the service and honors career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history. Architect Henry Hornbostel designed this memorial in 1907. Dedicated in 1910, the building was created in the Beaux-Arts style and is heroic in scale. It is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh at 4141 Fifth Avenue (although the walkway leading to its main entrance is signed as \"Matthew Ridgway Blvd.\" in honor of the World War II and Korean War hero who called Pittsburgh home). Situated adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh campus and its Cathedral of Learning, the building is set back from Fifth Avenue. It features expansive, well-kept lawns with large cannons and other war implements. The side streets flanking the building are Bigelow Boulevard and University Place, with O'Hara Street directly behind the memorial. It houses rare and one-of-a-kind exhibits that span the eras from the American Civil War to present-day conflicts. Since 1963, it has been home to the \"Hall of Valor,\" an exhibit that honors individual veterans from the region who went above and beyond the call of duty. The hall currently pays tribute to more than six hundred honorees, including winners of the Medal of Honor, The Kearny Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. The building houses an auditorium that seats 2,500, a banquet hall, meeting rooms, and a museum. The expansive lawn of the memorial sits on top of an underground parking garage operated under a long-term lease by the University of Pittsburgh. It has served as host for many city, civic, university, and business events, including an April 25, 1978, Gulf Oil Corporation shareholders meeting.[4] Filming location[edit] The 1991 psychological horror film Silence of the Lambs features the hall as the Memphis Courthouse, where the film's villain, Hannibal Lecter is kept in a makeshift cell.[5] The 2009 horror film Sorority Row uses the hall as the site of a graduation.[6] Famous visitors[edit] Ferdinand Foch visited the hall in 1921.[7] Garner Ted Armstrong of The World Tomorrow spoke at The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall on March 25, 1978.[8] G. E. Lowman spoke at the hall on April 23, 1938, and again in 1962[9] Nelson Mandela spoke at the hall on December 6, 1991. Barack Obama visited the hall in 2008. Donald Trump spoke at the hall on April 13, 2016.

It is dedicated to the life and works of American songwriter Stephen Foster. It is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District,[4][5] is designated as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historical Landmark,[3][6] and is a landmark whose significance is designated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Historical Marker.[7] It is located along Forbes Avenue in the Oakland neighborhood on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as Pitt. The main structure houses the two theaters that serve as performance spaces for the university's Department of Theatre Arts: the 478-seat Charity Randall Theatre and 151-seat Henry Heymann Theatre. The left wing of the building houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum and the Center for American Music which contains the University of Pittsburgh's Stephen Foster Collection and archive that includes manuscripts, copies of over 200 of his musical compositions, examples of recordings, songsters, broadside, programs, books, various memorabilia, and several musical instruments, including one of Foster's pianos.[8] The memorial is also home to the university's Ethelbert Nevin Collection[9] and the Society for American Music.[10] Building[edit] Fred Kelly Lobby Charity Randall Theatre Foster shrine entrance hallway and Charles Connick stained glass Interior of the Stephen Foster Shrine The Stephen Foster Memorial, dedicated in 1937, is a steel-framed structure faced with the same Indiana Limestone used for the university's Cathedral of Learning.[11] It is one of two buildings, the other being Heinz Memorial Chapel, designed by its architect, Charles Klauder, to accompany his centerpiece Cathedral of Learning on the gothic revival portion of the university's campus. The W.F. Trimble & Son's Company was contracted to help erect the building on March 2, 1935.[8] It was constructed using 35,000 cubic feet (990 m3) of Indiana limestone, 400 tons (360,000 kg) of steel, and 2,500 cubic yards (1,900 m3) of concrete.[8] In 2003, a $3.2 million renovation of the Stephen Foster Memorial, focusing on its theater facilities, was completed by Colker and Tom Wiley of Pittsburgh's WTW Architects.[12] The stone courtyard that is adjacent to the rear of the memorial, and sits between it and the south entrance to the Cathedral of Learning, is dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly and is named in his honor.[12] On the grounds of the memorial, near the Foster Shrine pavilion, sits a sundial on a stone base, currently missing its gnomon,[13] that was dedicated May 1914 to the Pittsburgh Blues of the War of 1812 by the Dolly Madison Chapter, U.S. Daughters of 1812. The sun dial was rededicated there on May 9, 1941.[14] The memorial building houses two theaters and, connected via a hallway, a memorial shrine dedicated to displaying items from the university's Foster Hall Collection. The Stephen Foster Memorial serves as the home for the Society for American Music and the University of Pittsburgh's Center for American's Music which encompasses a research library, archive and museum dedicated to expanding and documenting knowledge of American music and its role in American life. Fred Kelly Lobby[edit] The Fred Kelly Lobby, which serves as the lobby/foyer of the Charity Randall Theatre, is entered through the memorial's main Forbes Avenue-facing double red doors and contains two rectangular chandeliers by master metalworker Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia. The lobby also contains Charles Connick stained glass windows depicting Shakespeare (misspelled \"Shakespere\") and Beethoven that are dedicated to memorial benefactor Josiah Kirby Lilly.[11][15] The 2003 renovation of the memorial added new pieces of furniture to the lobby/foyer which including an octagonal upholstered banquette, a ticket and concession stand, as well as a new wrought iron ring wheel chandelier. These three additions were designed by Pittsburgh architect Michael Chirigos whose work was inspired by the memorial's Gothic arches. The banquette's seats enclose arched cabinets showcasing playbills for future productions along with college and career memorabilia associated with Gene Kelly's youngest brother, Fred. Both Kellys were Pitt graduates, and it was Fred who taught Gene and many others to dance. The display's cost was underwritten by Fred Kelly's family as an honor to his achievements as an influential choreographer who later became a pioneering television producer and director. The lobby also commemorates outstanding Pitt Theater alumni who are recipients of Department of Theatre Art's annual Fred Kelly Award.[15] Charity Randall Theatre[edit] The main 478-seat traditional proscenium theater, formerly known as the Foster Memorial Theatre,[16] was renamed as the Charity Randall Theatre following a $2 million renovation in 2003. The theater was reconditioned to bring it up to code, update its equipment, and replicate the original conditions of the auditorium's features. These renovations were undertaken with donations from the Charity Randall Foundation which was established in 1977 to remember the sister of Pitt graduate and businessman Robert Randall and to support her interest in the arts after her death in a car accident.[15] The plush, deep red seats, identical to those first installed New York's Radio City Music Hall, were reupholstered and their wrought iron frames and oak arms refinished to their original 1930s condition.[12] The number of seats were reduced from 572 to 478, including the addition of 24 new freestanding balcony seats. Other auditorium improvements include new carpeting and new lighting that highlights the vaulted stone ceiling, as well as a restoration of the original Samuel Yellin designed chandelier.[15] In addition, state-of-the-art sound, lighting, and production equipment was added, as well as a new rigging system, actors' restroom, and various stage improvements.[17] Henry Heymann Theatre[edit] The downstairs of the memorial houses the 153-seat Henry Heymann Theatre, featuring a thrust stage with seating on three sides. The theater honors the university's longtime scenic designer, and theater donor, Henry Heymann, who taught scenic design from 1968 until he retired in 1993.[16] The Heymann Theatre was created in 2000 in a space that formerly served as the memorial's social room, which hosted USO dances during World War II. A little-known tunnel also extends from the Heymann Theatre to under the loading dock level of the Cathedral of Learning, connecting the two buildings.[18] During the 2003 renovations to the memorial, the downstairs dressing room area was reconfigured to accommodate three \"star\" dressing rooms and men's and women's showers. Another basement room serves as headquarters for the still-active Tuesday Musical Club, which initiated the original idea and drive for the construction of the Stephen Foster Memorial.[15] Foster Shrine[edit] The left wing, composed of the pavilion of the Foster Shrine, is entered from the left of the building's foyer, which serves as the lobby of the Charity Randall Theatre, and through an entrance corridor that features Foster artifacts, a Foster bust, and five small casement windows featuring Connick stained glass windows devoted to symbols of Stephen Foster and his songs.[19] Moving along the corridor to the shrine, on the right is the entrance to the Foster Reading Room and library, which is home to much of the Foster collection, including its more fragile contents, that can be examined by appointment. Continuing on, the corridor opens into a 12-sided gothic chamber with lancet windows containing Connick stained glass medallions which illustrate various Foster songs.[15] On display in the Shrine in and around Gothic-arched alcoves are Foster's piano, sheet music, broadsides, recordings, and other personal items and memorabilia.[20] The 2003 renovation left the memorial shrine untouched, except for the addition of an unobtrusive fire suppression systems.[15] History[edit] Stephen Foster (1826–1864), the center's namesake The memorial's double red doors The memorial itself was conceived in 1927 when the Tuesday Musical Club, founded in 1889 by affluent female musicians, and University of Pittsburgh Chancellor John Bowman agreed to collaborate on a performance hall dedicated to Stephen Foster that would house the club's recitals.[21] Bowman donated land adjacent to where the foundation for the Cathedral of Learning was being laid for the memorial. However, little progress on the memorial was made until 1932 when Bowman learned of Josiah Kirby Lilly's Foster Hall Collection. After Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items, fund-raising began in earnest, with almost half the $550,000 cost coming from Lilly and his son, Eli.[15] Construction began January 13, 1935, the 71st anniversary of Foster's death. A dedication ceremony took place on June 2, 1937, Pitt's 150th anniversary.[11][15] The Foster Hall Collection itself was established in 1930 by Josiah Kirby Lilly, noted for being the president of the prominent Indianapolis pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company. The collection originally began as a retirement hobby based upon his lifelong love of Stephen Foster' s music, but it eventually grew into one of the major collections of American music and history. Lilly and his staff, with the help of some of Foster's relatives, as well as through contributions prompted by the publication of the Foster Hall Bulletin, accumulated over 10,000 Foster items. This initial collection was housed in Indianapolis in a small limestone building he called \"Foster Hall.\" Before his effort began, there had been no exact knowledge concerning the total number of Foster's works, nor any accurate literature published about the composer. Foster Hall's staff identified 201 original works, and Foster Hall became a resource center for John Tasker Howard's biography Stephen Foster: America's Troubadour (1934). Concerned about the future of his collection, Lilly donated the Foster Hall's holdings to the University of Pittsburgh's new Stephen Foster Memorial and the collection was moved to its new home in 1937. Since then, some additional 20,000 items reflecting Foster, composers influenced by him, and music in American life have been added.[22] The university's Center for American Music also houses the Ethelbert Nevin Collection, which was previously housed in the Theodore M. Finney Music Library until 1999. The Nevin Collection was acquired by the University of Pittsburgh between 1933 and 1956. The materials in the collection were either purchased or donated by Mrs. Ethelbert Nevin, other family members, and friends. The collection consists of original manuscripts, letters, mementos, furnishings, printed matter, and special gifts.[9] Aside from maintaining the collections and museum, The Center for American Music's projects include Voices Across Time, a curriculum support package that allows teachers to integrate historic American Music into their classrooms. The center also has undertaken Resources of American History II that will provide global online access to music scores, papers, sound recordings, and other American music-related materials in its archives.[23] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Stephen Foster Memorial.

He wrote more than 200 songs, including \"Oh! Susanna\", \"Hard Times Come Again No More\", \"Camptown Races\", \"Old Folks at Home\" (\"Swanee River\"), \"My Old Kentucky Home\", \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\", \"Old Black Joe\", and \"Beautiful Dreamer\". Many of his compositions remain popular today. Early life[edit] Foster's parents, Eliza Tomlinson Foster and William Barclay Foster There are many biographies of Foster, but details differ widely. Among other issues, Foster wrote very little biographical information himself, and his brother Morrison Foster may have destroyed much information that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family.[4][5] Foster was born on July 4, 1826,[6] in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. His parents, William Barclay Foster and Eliza Clayland Tomlinson Foster, were of Ulster Scots and English descent. He had three older sisters and six older brothers. He attended private academies in Allegheny, Athens, and Towanda, Pennsylvania, and received an education in English grammar, diction, the classics, penmanship, Latin, Greek, and mathematics.[citation needed] Foster taught himself to play the clarinet, guitar, flute, and piano. In 1839, his brother William was serving his apprenticeship as an engineer at Towanda and thought that Stephen would benefit from being under the supervision of Henry Kleber (1816–1897), a German-born music dealer in Pittsburgh. Under Kleber, Stephen was exposed to music composition.[7] Together the pair studied the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Mendelssohn and Schubert.[citation needed] The site of the Camptown Races – which would provide both the title and setting for events of one of Foster's best-known songs – was located 30 miles (48 km) from Athens and 15 miles (24 km) from Towanda. Foster's education included a brief period at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, now part of Washington & Jefferson College.[8][nb 1] His tuition was paid, but he had little spending money.[8] He left Canonsburg to visit Pittsburgh with another student[when?] and did not return.[8] Career[edit] House in Hoboken, New Jersey where Foster is believed to have written \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\" in 1854[10] Foster married Jane Denny McDowell on July 22, 1850, and they visited New York and Baltimore on their honeymoon. Foster then returned to Pennsylvania and wrote most of his best-known songs: \"Camptown Races\" (1850), \"Nelly Bly\" (1850), \"Ring de Banjo\" (1851), \"Old Folks at Home\" (known also as \"Swanee River\", 1851), \"My Old Kentucky Home\" (1853), \"Old Dog Tray\" (1853), and \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\" (1854), written for his wife Jane. Many of Foster's songs were used in the blackface minstrel shows popular at the time. He sought to \"build up taste...among refined people by making words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order\".[11] However, Foster's output of minstrel songs declined after the early 1850s, as he turned primarily to parlor music.[12] Many of his songs had Southern themes, yet Foster never lived in the South and visited it only once, during his 1852 honeymoon. Available archival evidence does not suggest that Foster was an abolitionist.[12] Foster's last four years were spent in New York City. There is little information on this period of his life, although family correspondence has been preserved.[13] Illness and death[edit] A Pittsburgh Press illustration of the original headstone on Stephen Foster's graveFoster became sick with a fever in January 1864. Weakened, it is possible he fell in his hotel in the Bowery and cut his neck; he may also have sought to take his own life.[14] His writing partner George Cooper found him still alive but lying in a pool of blood. Foster died in Bellevue Hospital three days later at the age of 37.[15] His leather wallet contained a scrap of paper that simply said, \"Dear friends and gentle hearts\", along with 37 cents in Civil War scrip and three pennies. Other biographers describe different accounts of his death.[16] Historian JoAnne O'Connell speculates in her biography, The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster, that Foster may have killed himself.[14] As O'Connell and musicologist Ken Emerson have noted, several of the songs Foster wrote during the last years of his life foreshadow his death, such as \"The Little Ballad Girl\" and \"Kiss Me Dear Mother Ere I Die.\" Emerson says in his 2010 Stephen Foster and Co. that Foster's injuries may have been \"accidental or self-inflicted\".[17] Telegram that communicated Stephen Foster's death addressed to his brother Morrison Foster The note inside Foster's wallet is said to have inspired Bob Hilliard's lyric for \"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\" (1949). Foster was buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. After his death, Morrison Foster became his \"literary executor\". As such, he answered requests for copies of manuscripts, autographs, and biographical information.[13] After his death, \"Beautiful Dreamer\", one of the best-loved of his works, was posthumously published in 1864.[18] Music[edit] See also: List of songs by Stephen FosterFoster grew up in Lawrenceville, now a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where many European immigrants had settled and were accustomed to hearing the music of the Italian, Scots-Irish, and German residents. He composed his first song when he was 14 and entitled it the \"Tioga Waltz\". The first song that he had published was \"Open thy Lattice Love\" (1844).[7][19] He wrote songs in support of drinking, such as \"My Wife Is a Most Knowing Woman\", \"Mr. and Mrs. Brown\", and \"When the Bowl Goes Round\", while also composing temperance songs such as \"Comrades Fill No Glass for Me\" or \"The Wife\".[6] Foster also authored many church hymns, although the inclusion of his hymns in hymnals ended by 1910. Some of the hymns are \"Seek and ye shall find\",[20] \"All around is bright and fair, While we work for Jesus\",[21] and \"Blame not those who weep and sigh\".[22] Several rare Civil War-era hymns by Foster were performed by The Old Stoughton Musical Society Chorus, including \"The Pure, The Bright, The Beautiful\", \"Over The River\", \"Give Us This Day\", and \"What Shall The Harvest Be?\".[citation needed][when?] He also arranged many works by Mozart, Beethoven, Donizetti, Lanner, Weber and Schubert for flute and guitar.[citation needed] Foster usually sent his handwritten scores directly to his publishers. The publishers kept the sheet music manuscripts and did not give them to libraries nor return them to his heirs. Some of his original, hand-written scores were bought and put into private collections and the Library of Congress.[13] Popular songs[edit] \"My Old Kentucky Home\" is the official state song of Kentucky, adopted by the General Assembly on March 19, 1928.[citation needed] Foster's songs, lyrics, and melodies have often been altered by publishers and performers.[23] In 1957 Ray Charles released a version of \"Old Folks at Home\" that was titled \"Swanee River Rock (Talkin’ ’Bout That River)\", which became his first pop hit that November.[24] In the 2000s[when?] \"Old Folks at Home\", designated the official state song of Florida in 1935,[25] came under attack for what some regarded as offensive terms in the song's lyrics. Changes were made to them with the approval of the Stephen Foster Memorial.[citation needed][when?] The modified song was kept as the official state song, while \"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)\" was added as the state anthem.[citation needed] A 1974 published collection, Stephen Foster Song Book; Original Sheet Music of 40 Songs (New York : Dover Publications, Inc.,) of Stephen Foster's popular songs was edited by musicologist Richard Jackson.[26] Legacy[edit] This section has multiple issues.

Susanna\" performed by the United States Navy Concert Band \"Old Folks at Home\" \"Old Folks at Home\" performed by Ernestine Schumann-Heink (1918) Problems playing these files? See media help. Many early filmmakers selected Foster's songs for their work because his copyrights had expired and cost them nothing.[27] Professor of Folklore and musician John Minton wrote a song titled \"Stephen C. Foster's Blues\".[28] Walt Kelly recorded an a cappella rendition of Foster's \"Old Dog Tray\" on the 1956 album, Songs of the Pogo. Kelly regularly referenced \"Old Dog Tray\" as the theme song for his character, Beauregard Hound Dog, from his comic strip, Pogo. Erika M. Anderson, of the band EMA, refers to Foster's \"Camptown Races\" in the song \"California\", from past Life Martyred Saints (2011): \"I bet my money on the bobtail nag/somebody bet on the bay.\"[29] The Firesign Theatre makes many references to Foster's compositions in their CD, Boom Dot Bust (1999, Rhino Records) Larry Kirwan of Black 47 mixes the music of Foster with his own in the musical Hard Times, which earned a New York Times accolade in its original run: \"a knockout entertainment\". Kirwan gives a contemporary interpretation of Foster's troubled later years and sets it in the tumultuous time of the New York draft riots and the Irish–Negro relations of the period. A revival ran at the Cell Theater in New York in early 2014, and a revised version of the musical called Paradise Square opened at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2018. Gordon Lightfoot wrote a song in 1970 titled \"Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)\" Randy Newman's 1970 album 12 Songs contained Newman's song \"Old Kentucky Home\" (originally titled \"Turpentine and Dandelion Wine\"), which is based on Foster's \"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\" Newman told Billboard magazine, \"It's a good song because Stephen Foster wrote the hook, that's why.\"[30] Under various titles, Newman's \"Old Kentucky Home\" was covered by the Beau Brummels, the Alan Price Set and Johnny Cash. Spike Jones recorded a comedy send-up \"I Dream of Brownie with the Light Blue Jeans\". Humorist Stan Freberg imagined a 1950s style version of Foster's music in \"Rock Around Stephen Foster\" and, with Harry Shearer, had a sketch about Foster having writer's block in a bit from his \"United States of America\" project. Songwriter Tom Shaner mentions Stephen Foster meeting up with Eminem's alter ego \"Slim Shady\" on the Bowery in Shaner's song \"Rock & Roll is A Natural Thing\". The music of Stephen Foster was an early influence on the Australian composer Percy Grainger, who stated that hearing \"Camptown Races\" sung by his mother was one of his earliest musical recollections. He went on to write a piece entitled \"Tribute to Foster\", a composition for mixed choir, orchestra, and pitched wine glasses based on the melody of \"Camptown Races\".[31] Art Garfunkel was cast as Stephen Foster and sang his songs in an elementary school play in Queens, New York [32] Foster's name is included in the rapid fire litany of musicians and songs that make up the lyrics of the 1974 pop novelty song \"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)\" by Reunion. Neil Sedaka wrote and recorded a song about Foster and released it on his 1975 album, The Hungry Years. Alternative country duo The Handsome Family's song \"Wildebeest\", from their 2013 album Wilderness, is about Foster's death.[33] Squirrel Nut Zippers wrote and recorded a song in 1998 titled \"The Ghost of Stephen Foster\". Stace England released in April 2024, as part of the group Foster's Satchel, a full-length album entitled Over the River: Stephen Foster Reimagined. John Fogarty of Creedance Clearwater Revival has said Foster's music inspired his own music especially \"Proud Mary\". Foster commemorative stamp in the Famous American Composers series, 1940[34] Television[edit] Two television shows about the life of Foster and his childhood friend (and later wife) Jane MacDowell were produced in Japan, the first in 1979 with 13 episodes, and the second from 1992 to 1993 with 52 episodes; both were titled Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair after the song of the same name. In the Honeymooners episode, \"The $99,000 Answer\", Ralph Kramden studies decades' worth of popular songs for his upcoming appearance on a television game show. Before each song, Ed Norton warms up on the piano by playing the opening to \"Swanee River\". On the program, Ralph is asked his first question for just 100 dollars: \"Who is the composer of 'Swanee River'?\" Ralph freezes, then nervously responds \"Ed Norton?\" and loses. In a \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" segment of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, Aladdin finds a lamp with a female genie with light brown hair, who immediately asks, \"Are you Stephen Foster?\" Lucille Ball, in an episode of The Lucy Show, announces that she is about to play a record called \"Bing Crosby Sings Stephen Foster.\" A Crosby impressionist is heard singing (to the melody of \"Camptown Races\") \"A-bum-bum-bum-bum bum-bum-bum, Stephen, Foster...\" Film[edit] Three Hollywood films have been made of Foster's life: Harmony Lane (1935) with Douglass Montgomery, Swanee River (1939) with Don Ameche, and I Dream of Jeanie (1952), with Bill Shirley. The 1939 production was one of Twentieth Century Fox's more ambitious efforts, filmed in Technicolor; the other two were low-budget affairs made by B-movie studios. In the film Tombstone (1993), Billy Clanton (played by Thomas Haden Church) tries to bait Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), who is playing a Chopin nocturne on the piano, by saying, \"Is that 'Old Dog Tray'? That sounds like 'Old Dog Tray' to me.\" When the goad fails, Clanton asks whether Doc knows any other songs, like \"'Camptown Races?', 'Oh Susanna', \"You know, Stephen stinkin' Foster?!?\" In the film A Million Ways to Die in the West, Seth MacFarlane's character, Albert can't get Foster's song \"If You've Only Got a Mustache\", from the previous scene, out of his head. Charlize Theron's character suggests singing a different song, to which he replies, \"There are only like 3 songs\", and she adds \"And they're all by Stephen Foster.\" In the 1949 film Mighty Joe Young the character Jill Young (Terry Moore) is able to calm her pet 12-foot-tall gorilla by whistling or playing \"Beautiful Dreamer\". In the movie Frankie and Johnny (1966) starring Elvis Presley - Johnny (Elvis character) talking to Cully (played by Harry Morgan - M*A*S*H) when reviewing a song says \"Let's hear it Stephen Foster\" Other events[edit] \"Stephen Foster! Super Saturday\" is a day of thoroughbred racing during the Spring/Summer meet at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. During the call to the post, selections of Stephen Foster songs are played by the track bugler, Steve Buttleman. The day is headlined by the Stephen Foster Handicap, a Grade I dirt race for older horses at 9 furlongs. Taylor Mac's A 24-Decade History of Popular Music includes a \"Father of American Music Smackdown\" in hour eight putting Foster's more problematic qualities up against the figure of Walt Whitman. 36 U.S.C. §140 designates January 13 as Stephen Foster Memorial Day, a United States National Observance. In 1936, Congress authorized the minting of a silver half dollar in honor of the Cincinnati Musical Center. Foster was featured on the obverse of the coin. \"Stephen Foster Music Camp\" is a summer music camp held on EKU's campus of Richmond, Kentucky. The camp offers piano courses, choir, band, and orchestra ensembles. Art[edit] Stephen Foster sculpture in Schenley Plaza, Pittsburgh, by Giuseppe Moretti (1900) A public sculpture by Giuseppe Moretti honoring Foster and commemorating his song \"Old Uncle Ned\" sat in close proximity to the Stephen Foster Memorial until 2018. The statue was removed following complaints about the banjo-playing slave seated next to Foster.[35] In Alms Park in Cincinnati, overlooking the Ohio River, there is a seated statue of him. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx, overlooking the Harlem River, has a bronze bust of him by artist Walker Hancock. Added in 1940, he is among only 98 honorees from 15 classes of distinguished men and women. In My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown, Kentucky, a musical, called The Stephen Foster Story has been performed since 1958. There is also a statue of him next to the Federal Hill mansion, where he visited relatives and which is the inspiration for My Old Kentucky Home. A painting by Howard Chandler Christy entitled, \"Stephen Foster and the Angel of Genius\" is on display in the park's art collection. The painting inspired Florence Foster Jenkins to author a tableau in which she personally plays the role of the angel depicted in Christy's painting. The scene was featured in the film Florence Foster Jenkins in 2016. Accolades and honors[edit] Foster is depicted on the obverse of the 1936 Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar Foster is honored on the University of Pittsburgh campus with the Stephen Foster Memorial, a landmark building that houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum, the Center for American Music, as well as two theaters: the Charity Randall Theatre and Henry Heymann Theatre, both performance spaces for Pitt's Department of Theater Arts. It is the largest repository for original Stephen Foster compositions, recordings, and other memorabilia his songs have inspired worldwide. Two state parks are named in Foster's honor: the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park in White Springs, Florida, and Stephen C. Foster State Park in Georgia. Both parks are on the Suwannee River. Stephen Foster Lake at Mt. Pisgah State Park in Pennsylvania is named after him. One state park is named in honor of Foster's songs, My Old Kentucky Home State Park, a historic mansion formerly named Federal Hill, located in Bardstown, Kentucky, where Foster is said to have been an occasional visitor according to his brother, Morrison Foster.[citation needed] The park dedicated a bronze statue in honor of Stephen's work. The Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh) Historical Society, together with the Allegheny Cemetery Historical Association, hosts the annual Stephen Foster Music and Heritage Festival (Doo Dah Days!). Held the first weekend of July, Doo Dah Days! celebrates the life and music of one of the most influential songwriters in America's history. His home in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, still remains on Penn Avenue nearby the Stephen Foster Community Center. Gallery[edit] The Stephen Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh contains two theaters Although most of Foster's original lyrics and manuscripts are lost, a sketchbook of his artwork is preserved at the Memorial's research library at the Pitt. Statue controversy and later views[edit] A 1900 statue of Foster by Giuseppe Moretti was located in Schenley Plaza, in Pittsburgh, from 1940 until 2018. On the unanimous recommendation of the Pittsburgh Art Commission, the statue was removed on April 26, 2018.[36] Its new home has not yet been determined. It has a long reputation as the most controversial public art in Pittsburgh \"for its depiction of an African-American banjo player at the feet of the seated composer. Critics say the statue glorifies white appropriation of black culture and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist.\"[37] A city-appointed Task Force on Women in Public Art called for the statue to be replaced with one honoring an African American woman with ties to the Pittsburgh community. The Task Force held a series of community forums in Pittsburgh to collect public feedback on the statue replacement and circulated an online form which allowed the public to vote for one of seven previously selected candidates or write in an alternate suggestion.[38] However, the Task Force on Women in Public Art and the Pittsburgh Art Commission have not reached an agreement as to who will be commemorated or if the statue will stay in the Schenley Plaza location.[39] The musicologist Ken Emerson has suggested that some of Foster's songs are \"a source of racial embarrassment and infuriation.\"[40] See also[edit] Stephen Foster Collection and archive Notes[edit] ^ His grandfather James Foster was an associate of John McMillan and a founding trustee of Canonsburg Academy, a predecessor institution to Jefferson College; his father William Barclay Foster attended Canonsburg Academy until age 16.[9] References[edit] ^ \"Stephen C.

Donations vary from booze, former pets now preserved in jars, to killing implements.[5][6] History[edit] The Miriellos acquired the victorian property which became Trundle Manor in 2007. Their fascination with Goth, Steampunk and classic horror films, led the couple to amass a private collection of oddities. The couple’s intrigue with the macabre began in their respective childhoods.[7][5] Mr. Arm recalls, \"I’ve been collecting since I was a little kid\".[4] They opened their collection, and house, to the public for tours in 2009. It attracts thousands a year as it has been prominently featured as place of interest in Pittsburgh.[8][9][10] Trundle Manor was featured on “MTV’s Extreme Cribs” in 2011.[2][6][11] Apart from giving tours, Trundle Manor also organizes and takes part in various events. It often hosts taxidermy classes, art, and comedy shows.[5][12] They have taken their collection on the road as a traveling 'creep show'.[1][13] Exhibits[edit] Olivia's Singing Tumor[edit] Olivia’s Singing Tumor is the centerpiece of their human reliquary. It features a large benign tumor encased in a glass jar with a musical contraption that makes it “sing.” The said tumor was donated by a belly dancer who gave it to the couple on the condition that it be put on display.[1][5][14] References[edit] ^ a b c Garcia, Deanna (July 31, 2017). \"Part Museum, Part Home: Animal Parts, Oddities And Love Make Up Pittsburgh's Trundle Manor\".

The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the southern edge of Schenley Plaza, opposite The Carnegie Institute, and is the home of Pitt's History of Art and Architecture Department, Studio Arts Department, and the Frick Fine Arts Library. Before its front steps is Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain. History[edit] Henry Clay Frick portrait by Malvina Hoffman on the facade of the building The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the site of the former Schenley Park Casino, Pittsburgh's first multi-purpose arena with an indoor ice skating rink, sat on the location of the building before burning down in December 1896.[4] The building itself is a gift of Helen Clay Frick (1888–1984), daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patron Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919). She established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s, when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it.[5] Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh. In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh, Miss Frick asked that successors to the New York architects Carrère and Hastings design the new facility after the Italian palazzo its firm had built in Manhattan for her father some fifty years earlier. Eventually, however, both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects. Its design is modeled after Pope Julius III's (1487–1555) Villa Giulia in Rome, Italy. The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard. An octagonal cupola, which caps the central rotunda, rises 45 feet above the ground.[5] The building houses the University of Pittsburgh's Department of History of Art and Architecture and Department of Studio Arts, and contains classrooms, an open cloister, an art gallery, a 200-seat auditorium, as well as a research library. Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965. By the late 1960s Miss Frick, unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building, severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh. She responded by creating a new venture, The Frick Art Museum, on the property of her ancestral home, Clayton, a few miles east in Pittsburgh's Point Breeze neighborhood. That museum operates today as a part of the Frick Art & Historical Center complex. Building use and features[edit] The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister of Frick Fine Arts Building Today, the Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms, art studios, a library, and art galleries around an open cloister and contains a 45 feet (14 m) high octagon capped by a pyramidal roof.[6] A noted 1965 low relief portrait of Henry Clay Frick by Malvina Hoffman in limestone sits above the entrance to the building. Hoffman was 79 years old when she accepted the commission. She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building. However, she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work.[7][8] Inside the main entrance, a neon work by contemporary Chinese artist Gu Wenda is installed in the lobby.[9] The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium that is used for lectures, performances, and special events.[10] Nicholas Lochoff Cloister[edit] The Frick Fine Arts Library The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister is a main feature of the Frick Fine Arts Building. Its large paintings of Italian masterpieces are scale reproductions that were commissioned in 1911 from Nicholas Lochoff by the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts (now the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts). Lochoff worked slowly and carefully. Only a few paintings were completed and sent back to Russia by the Russian Revolution of 1917. Lochoff, unable to return because of new communist regime, felt compelled to sell off the paintings. Buyers included Harvard University and the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Miss Frick acquired the entire collection, however, after Lochoff's death, with the help of art critic Bernard Berenson. In 2003, the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton. Also in the gallery are noted Carrara marble reproductions of 14th century Annunciation figures by sculptor Alceo Dossena.[11] Frick Fine Arts Library[edit] Located in Frick Fine Arts Building, this two-story library houses a circulating research collection serving the Departments of the History of Art and Architecture and Studio Arts. The Collection contains over 90,000 volumes and subscribes to more than 350 journals in relevant fields and is ranked among the top 10 fine art libraries in the country.[12][13] The library's reading room is constructed of fruit wood paneling and cabinetwork with gold leaf trim designed by Italian craftsmen. The library is further appointed by wrought iron balcony railings, terracotta tile flooring, maple tables with matching Windsor chairs, and ceiling-high windows furnishing views of Schenley Park. An inscription on the wall facing the entrance indicates the libraries dedication to Henry Clay Frick.[5] University Arts Gallery[edit] Entrance to the University Arts Gallery flanked by marble Dossena statues The permanent collection contains a collection of prints and graphic works dating from the 16th through 20th centuries and regularly hosts changing exhibitions sponsored by the Department of the History of Art and Architecture and the Friends organization. Some of the more prominent pieces in the permanent collection include a large collection of Jacques Callot and Gertrude Quastler prints; 16th-18th century drawings from the Clapp and Denny families; a collection of 19th and 20th century photography; the Gimbel collection of American art; and various Japanese prints, Asian ceramics, portraits, and Pittsburgh-related paintings by Hetzel, Gorson, and Kane.[5] Popular culture[edit] The Frick Fine Arts Building appeared in scenes set at the University of Pittsburgh on an episode of As the World Turns that aired on November 12, 2002.[14] Gallery[edit] Frick Fine Arts Auditorium Frick Fine Arts main entrance lobby Nicholas Lochoff Gallery Nicholas Lochoff Gallery The back of the Frick Fine Arts Building The Spanish War memorial is a copy of The Hiker (1925) by Allen Newman and sits on the left side of Frick Fine Arts References[edit] ^ \"National Register Information System\".

The Pennsylvania historical plaque honoring Jonas Salk's research conducted in Salk Hall that resulted in the first polio vaccine can be seen at the bottom right. Salk Hall from the rear Jonas Salk Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pennsylvania state[2] and Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark.[3] The Art Deco building is named after Jonas Salk, who conducted his research on the first polio vaccine in a basement laboratory while on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh.[4] Jonas Salk in 1955 holds bottles of a culture used to grow polio vaccines History[edit] The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city. It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz.[5] The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration.[6] The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city. Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health.[7] In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.6 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall. For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students. Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962.[8] Annex[edit] The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel[9] for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967[10] for a cost of over $5 million ($49.9 million today).[11] Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics. A new $50.6 million ($73 million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010.[12] It will include the construction of an 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m2) research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure.[13] The target completion date is July, 2014. Dental Museum[edit] A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall. The museum contains a variety of original dental artifacts, including a c. 1910 dental chair, and x-ray machine and instrument cabinet from the 1920s.[14] Pharmacy Museum[edit] Also contained in Salk Hall is the Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum,[15] which opened in the fall of 1996. Located on the fourth floor, the museum holds pharmacy memorabilia such as drug products, equipment, and sundry products dating back to the early 20th century. Among the museum's possessions are two hand-carved finials, which were often found over the door or partitions that separated the main part of the pharmacy from the back room where pharmacists did most of their work, an old-fashioned powder mill, and a konseal machine.[16][17] References[edit] ^ Historic Landmark Plaques 1968-2009 (PDF), Pittsburgh, PA: Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, 2010, p. 5, retrieved June 26, 2010 ^ \"Salk Polio Vaccine\".

Can't we have black and gold?[edit] I suspect this is some Wiki standard to make every municipal thing blue, ok only problem is many articles such as KDKA (Pittsburgh broadcasters box, CBS Owned stations box, CBS affilates box), University of Pittsburgh (Big East box, AAU box) are also blue, in fact the zoo, inclines, parks, museums, stadiums all have 3-8 blue boxes at the bottom, couldnt we have the city in it's official colors of blk and gold? Marketdiamond (talk) 07:59, 27 April 2011 (UTC)[reply] I believe the idea is to try to make more of them use coloring specified by MediaWiki:Common.css. It's not so much about blue, purple, or whatever, but having sufficient color contrast for the visually impaired, and to follow guidelines in WP:Deviations. If there were a black/gold theme in MediaWiki:Common.css, we could probably use that, since those with visual impairment could override those with a custom Special:MyPage/skin.css. We could also add a \"Pittsburgh\" class statement to this template, which would allow you to view it in black and gold. Thanks! Plastikspork ―Œ(talk) 13:07, 27 April 2011 (UTC)[reply] Thanks for the quick reply, so what I'm hearing is pick from the combinations given at MediaWiki and possibly build consensus to a degree if we are to propose a new color combo? Also I see the logic for the visually impaired that is an excellent point. Marketdiamond (talk) 23:18, 27 April 2011 (UTC)[reply] There is a contrast ratio calculator which is a useful tool for helping resolve issues regarding readability of text based on color presentations. Gold on black gives a 19.6 : 1 ratio. The W3 consortium's standards on contrast suggests a minimum of 7:1. There is no reason, policy, or guideline to not have a black and gold themed Pittsburgh navbar. CrazyPaco (talk) 02:06, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Just WP:Deviations, which includes a list of reasons. Thanks! Plastikspork ―Œ(talk) 02:43, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] That is a guideline, not a policy, which is mostly devoted to using wikimarkup, and specifically states \"deviations from standard conventions are acceptable where they create a semantic distinction\", which has long been the norm on Wikipedia, including in navboxes. There is no city in the world more identifiable with its official colors than Pittsburgh, and the navbox should reflect those colors. CrazyPaco (talk) 03:06, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] For any other city type category I would defer to anything that would make more sense for visually impaired with just blue, however as CrazyPaco was kind enough to describe, for anyone that has done any amount of research on the Pittsburgh region and especially the city itself, the colors of \"black and gold\" are tied more closely to it's identity then any other city I have known or traveled to (and I was a local government major in college). I could rattle off my everything from fire hydrants to police cars to for a time fire engines to dozens of sports teams but I think leaving my first statement out there to be challenged is sufficient. If there is a metro and city more tied to a set of colors as a true scholar and devotee of local governance I would be most fascinated to learn of that locale. Marketdiamond (talk) 04:08, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] FYI, yellow is not gold. I changed it. Frietjes (talk) 17:44, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] FYI, white isn't gold either, what happened to the header color, we aren't Chisox fans or Estonians. I am eternally grateful for editors who excel in certain fields such as wikipolicies however it seems the only editors willing to discuss things before deletion are the ones who are well versed that yellow is indeed gold in several counties in Western Pennsylvania, nevermind it being referred to as \"gold\" in other situations. I will fight the temptation to delete the most recent header changes for 48 hours and give people a chance to add their thoughts. I would vote for the current Frietjes color scheme however keep CrazyPaco's header color for \"Pittsburgh\" as well as the \"Portal\" and \"Book\" possibly, or just revert to CrazyPacos. Until the NFL tells the Steelers they wear yellow and not \"Aztec Gold\", I will still spell catsup with a K and end burg with an \"H\". If you are asking yourself what football, Ketchup and H's have to do with the Pittsburgh infobox you may need to work on your bona fides before unilaterally deleting from it without any discussion, submitted respectfully. Marketdiamond (talk) 20:22, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] The color gold that I selected is identical to the gold in the flag, so I would say that is the \"gold\" we want here. If by header you mean the \"titlestyle\", then I would suggest not adding \"gold\" to it. The problem is that the gold used by the various sports teams in the city are all slightly off from one another, and it will simply clash if we try to select one. White on black has excellent contrast. As I am sure you have noticed, we had no black background in this template as of less than a month ago. Frietjes (talk) 21:33, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] I'm just one vote (and I do live by my own advice of not deleting until discussing some), overall I would vote for the current color scheme below the titlestyle but as most articles only see the titlestyle white and black in it doesn't quite represent a city that paints its fire hydrants and police cars black and gold not to mention every pro major sport team. What shade or style of gold is up for debate, but as far as my vote CrazyPaco's titlestyle I did think best represented the city. Contrast is very important but we aren't discussing the infobox for Estonia or the Whitesox. Kudos for the black background, however the text provided the black in months prior. I would as an aside say I appreciate all the attention focused on the color scheme since the coding and wikipolicies on this aren't my strong point as much as the regions history and factoids, and I welcome the help and clarity. Bottom line the titlestyle is alone what appears on most articles unless a user clicks to open, the Whitesox and Estonia articles would not add yellow or gold to their titlestyle we really shouldn't add white to Pittsburgh's. Marketdiamond (talk) 03:22, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] If you want to add some gold, you could add a gold border to the title. I added this before, and then noticed it was clashing with the minor variations in gold to yellow in all the other Pittsburgh sports related boxes. Frietjes (talk) 17:06, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] I like the yellow/black color scheme. We sometimes use white and red on Polish templates. Although I'd be happy to look at MoS sections, if anybody can point me to relevant one(s). --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| talk 21:12, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] I believe the MOS section is in Wikipedia:Manual of Style (accessibility). I have no problem with adding gold to the header, I just find the variations an eyesore. Please don't go back to yellow, since the flag is not yellow. Frietjes (talk) 21:50, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] As long as it resembles gold-yellow-mustard-blonde etc. I'd be content with changing the text color in the header. Not sure about the border but if its done tastefully sure, the text being similar to the flag gold would be a must for me. Marketdiamond (talk) 22:53, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Since the navbox is auto-collapsed, I feel that the titlebar, which is what is displayed on the majority of pages the navbox is embedded in, should be in some combination of black and gold, regardless of the particular hugh of gold that is ultimately chosen. Black and white, IMO, is unacceptable as it is unrepresentative of Pittsburgh, which is the primary purpose of adding color. I have no strong attachment to particular gold hues (Flag gold vs Steeler Yellow) or the particular style of the group headings in the uncolllapsed navbox. CrazyPaco (talk) 07:02, 13 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] After talking to Marketdiamond I realised you Pittsburgher as slightly nuts but in a good way in that you love your you state very much. However I would ask you reconsider the yellow which is used. It's quite hard on the auld eyes Gnevin (talk) 09:43, 9 July 2011 (UTC)[reply] Valid point, and we do honestly appreciate opinions not exposed to 20 or 30 years of the Pittsburgh region. All I can say at this point is the consensus (not just myself) of experts have spoken. I encourage further discussion and would love to hear more well thought views on this.Marketdiamond (talk) 01:27, 20 July 2011 (UTC)[reply] Is it really accurate to refer to Market Square as a \"park\"?[edit] Market Square I don't think this is a \"park.\" What do other editors think? Grundle2600 (talk) 15:40, 10 February 2010 (UTC)[reply] The people I know that frequent Mellon Square (the actual square not what surrounds it) are looking for the same things as those that frequent Mellon Square, Schenley Plaza, Schenley Park, North Park, Highland Park, Point State Park etc. Marketdiamond (talk) 07:56, 27 April 2011 (UTC)[reply] It sort of is in the way Millennium Park in Chicago is a park, but is more of a square like those in Philladelphia, like Franklin Square. I don't know if it is officially a city park though, but in the absence of a separate category of plaza or squares, it is probably best to stick it in with parks. CrazyPaco (talk) 03:23, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Sports venues[edit] What do you think of adding some of the more minor venues like the Petersen Sports Complex and Trees Pool to the D1 sports venue list? I'm also not sure Fitzgerald Field House belongs in \"historic venues\" as it is a dedicated D1 collegiate volleyball venue. CrazyPaco (talk) 03:23, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Good catch, done and done also will add Island Sports Center for RMU hockey. One note of caution however, way back when I intended this only to be for \"revenue generating sports\", I think some alumnus or editor could make arguments for softball fields, golf courses, crew boat houses etc. etc. that are either technically Division I in a traditionally DII or DIII school (Point Park badmitten etc.?) or compete regularly with DI. I think I speak for most in that we shouldn't be including all of those pool halls, bowling alleys, tennis courts etc. So if things get too out of hand on this I reserve my vote to only \"revenue generating sports\" facilities. I added it today because from my experience swimming is indeed a very active sport and if your into it Trees Hall is the mecca for the region etc. But again I don't think anyone would want to see every possible psuedo Title IX token \"event\" facility for traditional DIII or NAIA schools that may have DI volleyball etc. Just putting that on the record now so there's no confusion a year from now when a well intentioned editor seeks to add the Art Institute's DI competing Jai-Alai futon. I joke but if the wikiverse has taught me anything it's that you are surprised every day. :-) Marketdiamond (talk) 20:38, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Of course, golf courses and crew boat houses aren't spectator venues. Drawing the line is always tough, but I'm not sure how you define \"revenue generating sports\". Do you add in Chartiers high stadium for the Riverhounds? Even though I brought them up, I'm not convinced Fitz and Trees Pool should be included. CrazyPaco (talk) 06:52, 13 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Pondering if maybe just providing a link to a wiki article on any venue or franchise outside the top 5 or so, and all the historical venues franchises might be a good compromise. Your right CP, its may be a never ending debate where to draw the line on merit, maybe just top 5 and then heres a wikiarticle with the historic or 6th etc. sports. Again no perfect solution but might compress the box some. Interested in other opinions on this. Also just a note I did add your suggestions out of fairness on how the box is \"currently\" displayed, fair is fair, but agree might be useful to compress it some, any 6th team or venue and all historic teams possibly only give a single link to, if we attempt to judge what to exclude on merit because of different sports different times and values (horseracing out drew the Steelers until the 1970s so someone could reasonably want those venues added etc), anyway top 5 for all venues and current pro and college teams then a link to the rest and all historic teams just a link would be my idea if there is a consensus on compressing the box, I think I saw a similar affect on the Howard Stern boxes. Marketdiamond (talk) 11:41, 2 June 2011 (UTC)[reply] Employers, sports, ...[edit] This template is rather large, with all the collapsible sections. I would like to suggest moving some material to more targeted templates. For example, we already have Template:Pittsburgh Corporations, which is redundant to the companies section, and Template:Pennsylvania Sports which is redundant to the sports section. I am sure there are others as well. If you look at (my eyes are already burning) a template like Template:New York City, it is very short. Frietjes (talk) 21:42, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] In fact, just take a random sample of the templates for the top 10 cities in the United States. None of them have collapsible sections, and none are as long as this one. Frietjes (talk) 21:46, 11 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] As the creator of the Pgh Corporations box I will be nominating it for deletion at the Wikiproject, have been meaning to retire as soon as the Pittsburgh template was set, pursuant to consensus of course. My views on the Pittsburgh template are well documented already. The sports template you mentioned puzzles me and every other Northeasterner-Mideasterner I know. I get the pigeon hole logic of neatly placing every franchise in a little box based on imaginary lines some despot drew on a very poorly researched map thousands of miles and hundreds of years away, but the encyclopedic value of having the New York Jets show up in a New Jersey box or having New Mexico or Kentucky not have a box for the Cowboys or Reds that consider both states their markets respectively, defeats the purpose. Burning eyes is an apt description for throwing away whole state fan bases for the Bengals or Mavs, and considering a 76ers fan to be in any way relevant to a Penguins fan. I would support a minimization of sports franchise templates limited by imaginary lines that have nothing to do with their markets yet include several non-markets if you choose to propose that. I can't name a single Flyers-Steelers fan nor a Phillies-Penguins fan, I do however know scores of Mountaineers-Penguins-Browns fans, maybe that would be a much more relevant template to construct. Marketdiamond (talk) 21:41, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] My point is that the template has too many collapsible sections, and it would be better to split it into smaller subtemplates, rather than trying to put everything in one. If I am reading an article about a company, I will most likely be interested in navigating to other articles about related companies, and not to say sports teams. Frietjes (talk) 21:54, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] I respect your opinion, and can see some logic to it. Interested in hearing from others on this since we are seeming to agree to disagree. I see your point about companies to like companies however I think it isn't as logical as going to the city or regional links associated with that city. Koppers doesn't have much of anything in common with Dick's Sporting Goods except both use Pittsburgh International and have Steeler days, have contracts with UPMC and relax at Mellon Square or Mt. Washington. The more I think about it the more your statement could support the status quo inclusions. I wouldn't be opposed to some limited thinning of the list (only revenue generating sports in DI or only links to a list of historic teams rather then unique links to all), but all the categories I would keep and about 80% of the current makeup. Again interested in other opinions, the reasonings you are presenting if you think through them may lend themselves to the consolidated expansion of other city/regional templates. Though I won't suggest that here at this time. Marketdiamond (talk) 23:02, 12 May 2011 (UTC)[reply] Colors are hard on the eyes[edit] Can't the gold be toned down a bit? They hurt my eyes. (Yes, I saw that it was chosen to match the flag, but still, it hurts.) LadyofShalott 13:27, 15 August 2011 (UTC)[reply] Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder. I think like a lot of things in life there are few folks \"ok\" with it, you either love it or can't understand it. Since we have throughly discussed this I would invite those unfamiliar with a land where fire hydrants, police cars, flags, all sports teams, road signs, clothing accessories and even some fire trucks and music videos are painted in \"black and gold\" to that place. I think after you walk down a street draped in it passing cars and trucks draped in it and look into shop windows with musicians not only draped in it but singing about those two colors you may gain an appreciation that black and gold is Pittsburgh like Oxygen is life. Again only my humble opinion but the airport code is PIT and there are transatlantic flights so I do invite you (btw the airport has some of it's best photo spots draped in black and gold imagine that!). Marketdiamond (talk) 06:40, 6 December 2011 (UTC)[reply] Color discussion, please leave comments[edit] There is an attempt to remove the colors as the sister template for Pitt. Please see the discussion Template talk:University of Pittsburgh#Removed colours. I am having difficulty understanding what the editor is having an issue with. Can anyone help and leave comments at the linked corresponding talk page? Thank you. CrazyPaco (talk) 17:25, 27 March 2012 (UTC)[reply] I will be undertaking some streamlining and reorganization of the template[edit] If any editor wishes to suggest or comment on the changes please feel free to leave them here! Marketdiamond (talk) 17:53, 9 September 2012 (UTC)[reply] Let's change the color scheme so that it's yellow text on black background. The black/blue on yellow headings are kinda rough. I tried to do it, but I am unclear of the right syntax to do it.--GrapedApe (talk) 23:49, 9 September 2012 (UTC)[reply] One suggestion I would have is to streamline by bringing Parks and Shopping and entertainment within Attractions. Auto select for each group so that the relevant section opens upon template expansion would be useful too. An example of this in use is the template Skyscrapers over 140 metres in the United Kingdom, which can be seen in operation at One Canada Square. Rangoon11 (talk) 00:22, 10 September 2012 (UTC)[reply] Add \"abbr\" parameters so only that section opens[edit] This edit request has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Talk about procrastination: Back in 2012 I added the selected parameter but only added the abbr parameter to the sports section. I meant to add the rest but the template got protected & here it is 3 years later.... Here is my request: This is explained in Template:Navbox with collapsible sections#Group/list parameters. There are 9 main groups: Government, Economy, Sports, Parks, Transportation, Attractions, Shopping, Colleges, Culture. Please change | group1 = [[Government of Pittsburgh|Government]] | list1 = to | group1 = [[Government of Pittsburgh|Government]] | abbr1 = Government | list1 = Now this goes on for 8 more sections, so instead of copying the entire code, I'll only include the additional code to be inserted between the group# and list#. For group2, please add | abbr2 = Economy For group3, please add | abbr3 = Sports I did that one back in '12. For group4, please add | abbr4 = Parks For group5, please add | abbr5 = Transportation For group6, please add | abbr6 = Attractions For group7, please add | abbr7 = Shopping For group8, please add | abbr8 = Colleges For group9, please add | abbr9 = Culture Finally, at the bottom of the template, please add the documentation. Please change: <noinclude> {{collapsible option}} [[Category:Pittsburgh navigational boxes]] [[Category:Pennsylvania city navigational boxes]] </noinclude> to <noinclude> {{documentation |content = {{collapsible sections option |list = \"Government\", \"Economy\", \"Sports\", \"Parks\", \"Transportation\", \"Attractions\", \"Shopping\", \"Colleges\", \"Culture\" |example = Government }} {{collapsible option}} }}<!--(end documentation)--> [[Category:Pittsburgh navigational boxes]] [[Category:Pennsylvania city navigational boxes]] </noinclude> Two notes: (1) I am a dynamic IP that changes every 8 hours when my ISP auto-disconnects and my modem (!) re-dials (so pings & talkpage msgs won't work, I'll watch this page), & (2) I come here from the Homestead Grays article and am basing this request off of Template:Negro League teams (heavily edited by me) which implements the \"abbr\" parameters & documentation. Pinging @Frietjes: who has helped me in the past & who knows templates extensively. Rgrds. --64.85.217.37 (talk) 09:41, 17 August 2015 (UTC)[reply] Done Stickee (talk) 22:17, 17 August 2015 (UTC)[reply] Ridiculously large[edit] I see @Frietjes: mentioned this years ago, but this template is unwieldy and far too large, making maintenance of the template a difficult task and much harder to use. It is definitely an anomaly in style vs. every other large city template used on the wikipedia. I believe we should split this up into at least 5 to 8 other templates. Some are already redundant (see Template:Pittsburgh Corporations nearly matching the \"Economy\" section, Template:Pittsburgh Shopping being similar to \"Shopping and entertainment\", Template:Pittsburgh parks similar to \"Parks\", etc). It appears this project, as well as most of the city based projects, were at one point commandeered to suit their personal preferences to point of ridiculousness (such as the recent nomination of Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pittsburgh sports seasons; another unwieldy, jargon-filled, and incoherently large article). If a much larger city like New York can have this many templates, I think this can be fixed and pared down to something far more reasonable. Yosemiter (talk) 20:24, 22 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] Yosemiter the redundancy is clear since with edits like this one, this template transcludes other templates like {{Pittsburgh Bridges}}, {{Pittsburgh Corporations}}, {{Pittsburgh Shopping}}, {{Pittsburgh metropolitan area airports}}, {{Pittsburgh parks}}, {{Pittsburgh transportation}}, {{PittsburghTransit}} and {{Port Authority of Allegheny County}}. in many cases, there is no need to use this navbox, but instead, use one of the smaller (more targeted) navboxes within this one. I would support more splitting, and less use of this one in favor of the other smaller navboxes transcluded in this one. Frietjes (talk) 20:56, 22 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] I would start by splitting the sports section in say {{Pittsburgh sports}} with Sports in Pittsburgh as the main article. Frietjes (talk) 20:59, 22 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] @Frietjes: I think my point is that is there a reason so many need to be transcluded? This is essentially a Template of Pittsburgh Templates. It seems that it would be far more helpful if it was written/displayed in a way such as Template:New York City. The first subheader would become group1 \"General topics\" Then we could list each of the other topics into groups of the trunscluded templates (Gov't, Sport, Transportation, etc.). As pointed out, these other templates already exist on their own, so why have template as a Matryoshka doll-like list of templates? It just appeared as very unusual to me upon finding it. Yosemiter (talk) 21:37, 22 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] Yosemiter, seems reasonable to not transclude the other navboxes and keep this template more minimal with links to the higher-level articles. just make sure that any articles using this template are appropriately updated after the other navboxes are split from this one. this would also help reduce the over 1000 page transclusion count for this navbox (which is insane). Frietjes (talk) 21:39, 22 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] @Frietjes:, @Yosemiter:-- I just condensed the topics covered in this template. I wasn't sure what to do with some of the information in the \"Economy\" section, so I left that for now. Otherwise, this should bring the template in line with those of similarly-sized cities.--Molandfreak (talk, contribs, email) 05:11, 26 January 2019 (UTC)[reply] Molandfreak, looks much better. the next task is to fix the pages in this report by adding the navbox to a couple articles, and replacing it with one of the various {{Pittsburgh Bridges}}, {{Pittsburgh Corporations}}, {{Pittsburgh Shopping}}, {{Pittsburgh metropolitan area airports}}, {{Pittsburgh parks}}, {{Pittsburgh transportation}}, {{PittsburghTransit}}, {{Pittsburgh sports}}, {{Port Authority of Allegheny County}}, ... related templates.

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Etymology[edit] Main article: Name of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19] \"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[20] From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22] History[edit] Main article: History of Pittsburgh For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh. Historical claims Kingdom of France 1690s–1763 Great Britain 1681–1781 United States 1776–present Native Americans[edit] The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]: 289 18th century[edit] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh. The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26] In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[28] During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32] During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36] Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory. 19th century[edit] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857 Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874) Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[37] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[38] The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39] The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century[edit] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[41] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[42] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936. The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45] During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[48] Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11] In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century[edit] During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49] In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50] Geography[edit] See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a] The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53] Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape[edit] Main articles: Downtown Pittsburgh, North Side (Pittsburgh), South Side (Pittsburgh), and West End (Pittsburgh) See also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods East Carson Street in the South Side Flats Shadyside neighborhood The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding it—Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55] Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown. The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58] The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development. The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[73] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74] Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The city ranked 26th for short-term particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for year-round particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84] Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86] As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87] Water quality[edit] Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95] The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104] Demographics[edit] This section needs to be updated.

Each dot is 25 people: ⬤ White ⬤ Black ⬤ Asian ⬤ Hispanic ⬤ Other At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010,[108] compared to 78.7% in 1970.[109] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[107] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,[115] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census.[116] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States.[117] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[118] In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.[119] Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year.[120][121] As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[122] Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China, India, Korea and Italy.[123] Demographic changes[edit] Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[13] This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[124] In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125] These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127] Religion[edit] Religion in Pittsburgh (2014)[128] Religion Percent Protestantism 42% Catholicism 32% Other Christian 3% No religion 18% Others 4% Don't know 1% According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.[128] According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.[118] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200.[129] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.[130][131] Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Pittsburgh See also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[132] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[133] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[134] or the American Dream.[135] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[136] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[137] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[138] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[139] The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\"[140] Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022(ranked by revenues)with metropolitan and U.S. ranks Metro corporation US 1 The Kraft Heinz Company 139 2 U.S. Steel 172 3 PNC Financial Services 178 4 Viatris 204 5 PPG Industries 218 6 Dick's Sporting Goods 307 7 Alcoa 312 8 WESCO International 357 9 Wabtec 439 10 Arconic 452 Education is a major economic driver in the region.

The global impact of Pittsburgh technology and business was recently demonstrated in several key components of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner being manufactured and supplied by area companies.[144] Area retail is anchored by over 35 shopping malls and a healthy downtown retail sector, as well as boutique shops along Walnut Street, in Squirrel Hill, Lawrenceville and Station Square. The nonprofit arts and cultural industry in Allegheny County generates $341 million in economic activity that supports over 10,000 full-time equivalent jobs with nearly $34 million in local and state taxes raised.[145] A leader in environmental design, the city is home to 60 total and 10 of the world's first green buildings while billions have been invested in the area's Marcellus natural gas fields.[146] A renaissance of Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry—that boasts the world's first movie theater—has grown from the long-running Three Rivers Film Festival to an influx of major television and movie productions. including Disney and Paramount offices with the largest sound stage outside Los Angeles and New York City.[147] Pittsburgh has hosted many conventions, including INPEX, the world's largest invention trade show, since 1984;[148] Tekko, a four-day anime convention, since 2003; Anthrocon, a furry convention, since 2006; and the DUG East energy trade show since 2009. In 2015, Pittsburgh was listed among the \"eleven most livable cities in the world\" by Metropolis magazine.[149][150] The Economist's Global Liveability Ranking placed Pittsburgh as the most or second-most livable city in the United States in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2018.[151][152] Arts and culture[edit] Main article: Culture of Pittsburgh Entertainment[edit] East Room of the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens Pittsburgh boasts a rich arts and culture scene, with a history dating back to 19th-century industrialists who commissioned and donated public works including Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts and the Benedum Center, home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera.

Pittsburgh has emerged as a leading city in the United States' heavy metal music scene.[160][161] Many punk rock and Hardcore punk acts, such as Aus Rotten and Anti-Flag, originated in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has also seen many metal bands gain prominence in recent years,[when?] most notably Code Orange, who were nominated for a Grammy. The city was also home to the highly influential math rock band Don Caballero. Pittsburgh also had an influential electronic music subculture in the 1990s, with origins similar to internet chatroom-based movements across the United States.[162][163][164] Pittsburgh promoters and DJs organized raves in warehouses, ice rinks, barns, and fields which eventually attracted thousands of attendees.[163][165][166] DJs Adam Beyer and Richie Hawtin played at local raves.[163] One notable figure, drum and bass DJ Dieselboy, emerged from this scene.[162][167] Since 2012, the Hot Mass after-hours electronic music dance party has been a key part of Pittsburgh's electronic music scene, noted for its European nightclub vibe.[168][169] Electronic artist Yaeji has credited Hot Mass as a formative influence during her time at Carnegie Mellon University.[170][171] Theatre[edit] Main article: Theatre in Pittsburgh Benedum Center The city's first play was produced at the old courthouse in 1803[26] and the first theater built in 1812.[26] Collegiate companies include the University of Pittsburgh's Repertory Theatre and Kuntu Repertory Theatre, Point Park University's resident companies at its Pittsburgh Playhouse, and Carnegie Mellon University's School of Drama productions and Scotch'n'Soda organization. The Duquesne University Red Masquers, founded in 1912, are the oldest, continuously producing theater company in Pennsylvania.[citation needed] The city's longest-running theater show, Friday Nite Improvs, is an improv jam that has been performed in the Cathedral of Learning and other locations for 20 years.

Award-winning author John Edgar Wideman, who grew up in Pittsburgh, has based several books in the city, including Brothers and Keepers. Poet Terrance Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, earned his MFA at the University of Pittsburgh and was a faculty member there. Other local poets include Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press, and Samuel John Hazo, Pennsylvania's first poet laureate. Contemporary writers like Kathleen Tessaro, author of novels such as Elegance, The Perfume Collector, and Rare Objects, and new authors including Chris Kuzneski and Brian Celio, who captures Pittsburgh's \"Yinzer\" dialect, contribute to the city's vibrant literary tradition. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[176] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists. Pittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community-owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Happy's Party, Cappelli & Company, and The Children's Corner, all nationally broadcast. The Pittsburgh Dad series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011. The modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his Chiller Theatre,[177] director and writer Rusty Cundieff and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[178] The genre continues today with the PARSEC science fiction organization,[179] The It's Alive Show, the annual \"Zombie Fest\",[180] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[181] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[182] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[183][184] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose. Food[edit] A Primanti Bros. sandwich Pittsburgh is known for several specialties including pierogies, kielbasa, chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and Klondike bars.[185][186] In 2019, Pittsburgh was deemed \"Food City of the Year\" by the San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&co.[187] Many restaurants were favorably mentioned, among them were Superior Motors in Braddock, Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville, Spork in Bloomfield, Fish nor Fowl in Garfield, Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield, and Rolling Pepperoni in Lawrenceville.[188] Pittsburgh is home to the annual pickle-themed festival Picklesburgh, which has been named the \"best specialty food festival in America\".[189] Local dialect[edit] Main article: Western Pennsylvania English The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called Pittsburghese, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[190] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as \"Yinzers\" (from the local word \"yinz\" [var. yunz], a blended form of \"you ones\", similar to \"y'all\" and \"you all\" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[191] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[192] Livability[edit] The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park Pittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy. The largest, Frick Park, provides 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive hiking and biking trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding enthusiasts visit the Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where over 100 species of birds have been recorded.[193] Residents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have occasional floods,[194] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[195] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[194][196][197] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[194] Pittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[16] Sports[edit] Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the Sporting News title of \"Best Sports City\" in the United States[198] and, in 2013, Sperling's Best Places \"top 15 cities for baseball\".[199] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne. Pittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[200] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[201] Further, the Pittsburgh Riverhounds professional soccer team of the USL Championship division wear black and gold colors. \"Rails to Trails\", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail.[202] Several mountain biking trails are within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[203][204] Professional[edit] Major league Team Founded League Sport Venue Championships Pittsburgh Pirates 1882 Major League Baseball (MLB) Baseball PNC Park 7[o 1] Pittsburgh Steelers 1933 National Football League (NFL) Football Acrisure Stadium 6[o 2] Pittsburgh Penguins 1967 National Hockey League (NHL) Hockey PPG Paints Arena 5[o 3] Minor league/other Team Founded League Sport Venue Championships Pittsburgh Riverhounds 1999 USL Championship (USLC) Soccer Highmark Stadium Steel City Yellow Jackets 2014 ABA Basketball A Giving Heart Community Center 1 ^ The Pirates won championships in 1901, 1902, 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. 1901 and 1902 were Pre World-Series Era Champions. ^ The Steelers won championships in 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, and 2008. ^ The Penguins won championships in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. **Pittsburgh's ABA franchise won the 1968 title, but the Steel City Yellow Jackets franchise is heir to it only in location.

ESPN The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of the National League. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[205] Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[206] Football[edit] Further information: American football in Western Pennsylvania Pittsburgh Steelers' fans waving the Terrible Towel, a tradition that dates back to 1975 The city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927.

The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[207] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[208] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. College football in the city dates to 1889[209] with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winning the 2021 ACC Championship Game which was the program's first conference title since leaving the Big East for the ACC between the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[210] Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Acrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[211] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium.

From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213] The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center.

His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey. Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[221] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[222] Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Emily Kinkead-20, Lindsay Powell-21, Dan Frankel-23, La'Tasha Mayes-24, Dan Deasy-27, Abigail Salisbury-34, Jessica Benham-36, and John Inglis-38).

Law enforcement[edit] A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police The area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers. The city also has separate housing and school police departments. Other agencies also provide police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs. The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania. Crime[edit] Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd \"most secure\" big city by Farmers Insurance.[223] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[224][225] Per 100,000 persons stats (2012): Murder Rape Robbery Assault Burglary Theft Motor vehicle Total violent Total property City 13.1 15.1 363.3 360.4 812.8 2,438.2 174.3 752.0 3,425.4 At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226] In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230] Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories \"police budget cost per person,\" \"fines / forefeitures,\" \"Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),\" \"Force Used per Arrest,\" \"Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,\" \"Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,\" \"Discrimination Complaints Upheld,\" \"Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,\" \"Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,\" and \"Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.\" This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231] Education[edit] Colleges and universities[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh The main campus of Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

Independent student-written university-based newspapers include The Pitt News of the University of Pittsburgh, The Tartan of Carnegie Mellon University, The Duquesne Duke of Duquesne University, and The Globe of Point Park University. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law is also home to JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service.[241] Television[edit] The Pittsburgh metro area is served by multiple local television and radio stations. The Pittsburgh designated market area (DMA) is the 22nd-largest in the U.S. with 1,163,150 homes (1.045% of the total U.S.).[242] The major network television stations include KDKA-TV 2 (CBS), WTAE 4 (ABC), WPXI 11 (NBC), WINP-TV 16 (Ion), WPKD-TV 19 (Independent), WPNT 22 (The CW/MyNetworkTV), WPCB 40 (Cornerstone), and WPGH-TV 53 (Fox). KDKA-TV, WINP-TV, and WPCB are owned-and-operated by their respective networks. WQED 13 is the local PBS member station in Pittsburgh. It was established on April 1, 1954, and was the first community-sponsored television station and the fifth public station in the United States. The station has produced much original content for PBS, including Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, several National Geographic specials, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?[243] Radio[edit] A wide variety of radio stations serve the Pittsburgh market. The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, which began airing on November 2, 1920.[244] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKA-FM 93.7 FM (sports), WKST-FM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMO-AM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock). There are also three public radio stations in the area: WESA 90.5 FM (National Public Radio affiliate), WQED 89.3 FM (classical), and WYEP 91.3 FM (adult alternative). Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM). Film[edit] Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[245] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys,[246] Dogma,[246] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[246] Sudden Death, Flashdance,[246] Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[246] Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences.[246][247] Pittsburgh became \"Gotham City\" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises.[147] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.[248] From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy.[249][250] Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[251][252] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[253] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[252] Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[254][255] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[256][257] Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[258][259][260][261][262] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[263] Utilities[edit] Further information: Allegheny County Sanitary Authority The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[264] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[265] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[266] Health care[edit] See also: List of hospitals in Pittsburgh UPMC's flagship, UPMC Presbyterian Allegheny General Hospital, the flagship of the Allegheny Health Network The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among U.S. News & World Report's \"Honor Roll\" every year since 2000.[citation needed] The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[267] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".[268] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[26] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[269] In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[270] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[271] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273] The $80 million ($146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed] In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276] Health discoveries[edit] While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955. UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279] The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280] Transportation[edit] Main article: Transportation in Pittsburgh Aerial view of some of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges\".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283] Public transportation statistics[edit] Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[284] Expressways and highways[edit] Expressways Other Highways Parkway North US 19 PA 88 Parkway East & West TruckUS 19 PA 121 Crosstown PA 8 PA 130 Allegheny Valley Expressway PA 50 PA 380 Ohio River Boulevard PA 51 PA 837 PA 60 PA 885 I-279 Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh). Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit] Main articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City. Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285] Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station. Regional mass transit[edit] Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit Steel Plaza subway station Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook. Freight rail[edit] Union Station, built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Port[edit] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[289] Notable people[edit] Main article: List of people from Pittsburgh Sister cities[edit] Pittsburgh's sister cities are:[290] Bilbao, Spain Da Nang, Vietnam Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay Gaziantep, Turkey Glasgow, Scotland Karmiel, Israel Matanzas, Cuba Misgav, Israel Naucalpan, Mexico Ostrava, Czech Republic Prešov, Slovakia Saarbrücken, Germany Saitama, Japan San Isidro, Nicaragua Sheffield, England[g] Skopje, North Macedonia Sofia, Bulgaria Wuhan, China Zagreb, Croatia See also[edit] Pennsylvania portalCities portal Greater Pittsburgh Region List of fiction set in Pittsburgh List of municipalities in Pennsylvania List of people from Pittsburgh Explanatory notes[edit] ^ The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill. ^ The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

Most of these offices are housed within the Pittsburgh City-County Building. The Government of Pittsburgh receives its authority from the Pennsylvania General Assembly pursuant to Part III of Title 53 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, relating to Cities of the Second Class. Mayor[edit] Main article: Mayor of Pittsburgh The Mayor of Pittsburgh is elected every 4 years. The current mayor is Ed Gainey. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief of Staff has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning and as a \"gatekeeper\" to the mayor. City Council[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh City Council The Pittsburgh City Council is a nine-member city council. City council members are chosen by plurality elections in each of nine districts. Law enforcement[edit] The mayor appoints (with City Council approval) the position of Pittsburgh Police Chief. The city and its immediate suburbs are served by the four-year elected Allegheny County District Attorney to prosecute criminal offenses and the congressionally appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania for federal offenses. The city and its residents are also served by the elected four-year term Allegheny County Sheriff and the County council-appointed Allegheny County Police Department Chief. Pittsburgh Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority[edit] Pittsburgh finances are subject to the Pittsburgh Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, the city's state-appointed financial oversight body.[1] Boards, Authorities and Commissions[edit] Many governmental functions are carried out by boards, authorities and commissions.

The David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLCC or DLLCC) is a 1,500,000-square-foot (140,000 m2) convention, conference and exhibition building in downtown Pittsburgh in the U.S. commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is served by two exits on Interstate 579. The initial David L. Lawrence Convention Center was completed on the site on February 7, 1981, but as part of a renewal plan the new, completely redesigned center was opened in 2003 and funded in conjunction with nearby Acrisure Stadium and PNC Park. It sits on the southern shoreline of the Allegheny River. It is the first LEED-certified convention center in North America and one of the first in the world.[2] It is owned by the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County.[3] History[edit] In the early 1970s a site on the opposite side of downtown Pittsburgh was considered for a modern convention center, on the shores of the Monongahela River. On September 20, 1971, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania failed to approve that location, and site work slowly began on the present site as the city and county submitted it to the commonwealth on December 10, 1974. There was a proposal in mid-1974 to locate the center at the then transitioning Penn Station.[4] The center had its ceremonial groundbreaking on June 8, 1977.[5][6][7] On February 7, 1981, the original $35 million ($134 million today) structure opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Mayor Richard Caliguiri, County Commissioner Tom Foerster and Governor Dick Thornburgh.[8] The old convention center was 131,000 sq ft (12,000 m2) and lacked a ballroom. The 1981 building was demolished to make way for the current structure, built on the same site. After the Commonwealth approved funding for the redesigned center on February 3, 1999 Rafael Viñoly Architects, P.C. was chosen as the designer for the modern center on February 28, 1999. Viñoly along with Dewhurst MacFarlane & Partners and Goldreich Engineering P.C. constructed the $354 million ($668.2 million today) riverfront landmark to contain 313,400 sq ft (29,100 m2) of exhibit space (236,900 sq ft (22,000 m2) of which is column-free), 76,500 sq ft (7,100 m2) of additional exhibit space, a 31,610 sq ft (2,940 m2) ballroom, 51 meeting rooms, two 250-seat lecture halls, teleconference and telecommunications capabilities and 4,500 sq ft (420 m2) of retail space (currently in development). The architect, Viñoly, began the design with a goal in mind of achieving the status of a \"green\" building. In 2003, the building was awarded Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, making it the first such convention center in the U.S. and the largest \"green\" building in the world.[2] The newly rebuilt building won the 2004 Supreme Award for structural engineering excellence from the Institution of Structural Engineers. The convention center is home to prominent conventions, such as Anthrocon, the Pittsburgh RV Show, Pittsburgh Boat Show, Pittsburgh Home and Garden Show, Piratefest, and the acclaimed Pittsburgh International Auto Show. Naming[edit] The center—though completely a structure of 2003 construction—chose to retain the name of the earlier convention center on the site completed in 1981 in honor of David Leo Lawrence (June 18, 1889 – November 21, 1966). Lawrence was an American politician who served as the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania from 1959 to 1963, only retiring because of the state's then term limit of 1 per governor. He is to date the only mayor of Pittsburgh to be elected Governor of Pennsylvania. Previously, he had been the longest tenured mayor of Pittsburgh (1946–1959) and the primary force behind Pittsburgh's urban renewal projects including the Mellon Arena, Gateway Center, Fort Pitt Tunnel and Point State Park. He was Pennsylvania's first Catholic Governor (at the time a major breakthrough for an Irish Catholic), and a major force in the national Democratic Party from the 1930s to the 1960s. Historians credit him with among other behind-the-scenes labors, leading a compromise at the 1944 National Democratic Convention that eventually made Harry Truman president. As well as healing a divided national convention of 1960 that resulted in the John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson ticket, it is for these reasons as well as his work in the state and the city that he was dubbed \"kingmaker\" by party leaders. Incidents[edit] On February 13, 1982, a Car Expo Mercury display featuring a 130-pound cougar named Tom Tom mauled a 9-year-old Upper St. Clair boy before Pittsburgh Police officers shot the animal dead. The boy survived after being treated at Allegheny General Hospital for several days.[9][10] On February 12, 2002, less than two weeks before the scheduled opening of the new center,[11] a 165-ton truss that was under construction collapsed, killing one and injuring two workers.[12] The truss was part of the second phase of construction, scheduled for opening in 2003, and did not delay the February 23 opening of phase one. On February 5, 2007, a section of concrete floor from the second floor loading dock collapsed under the weight of a tractor-trailer and fell onto the water feature area below.[13] There were no injuries. The building remained closed until investigations by the contractors were completed on March 9, the fault was repaired, and the convention center reopened.

It is located in Downtown Pittsburgh at 414 Grant Street. Built from 1915 to 1917 it is the third seat of government of Pittsburgh. Today the building is occupied mostly by Pittsburgh offices with Allegheny County located in adjacent county facilities. It also contains a courtroom used for the Pittsburgh sessions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. History[edit] At the start of the 20th century, city and county officials began to realize that the current structure which housed the city and county government offices was insufficient for the city's rapid growth. The offices at that time were located in the Smithfield Street City Hall building, which was built in 1868-1872. The demand for new offices grew exponentially with the incorporation of Allegheny City into the City of Pittsburgh in 1907, which added 130,000 new residents to the city.[1] In 1909 plans for a new City Hall began. Mayor William A. McGee proposed selling the current offices in the Smithfield Street City Hall and the Public Safety building, and using these funds to buy the Allegheny County Courthouse and use it as the space for construction of a new City Hall.[2] By 1912 the plans moved forward substantially with both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County approving a joint venture to purchase the land and both occupy the new building. The architect for the new building was to be chosen through a competition, only accepting architects residing and doing business within Allegheny County.[3] Regional favoritism was used in the building's construction as well, as in 1914 Mayor Joseph Armstrong claimed that all material for the building should come from manufactures who produce and are located in Pittsburgh, and that all labor employed should be obtained or taken from Allegheny County.[4] The plans for the development of the new building even extended to some of the prominent organization within Pittsburgh such as the Carnegie Library, and the Civic Club of Allegheny County who both had plans for space in the new building.[5][6] Construction was postponed for more than a year though as the general contracting firm of W. F. Trimble & Sons filed an injunction claiming that the selection of James L. Stuart as consulting and supervising engineer was done through an improper bidding process.[7] The case was eventually decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and resolved by a legislative act, and development on the building was allowed to continue.[8] The groundbreaking on the building occurred with a ceremony on July 6, 1915, with County Commissioner I. K. Campbell striking the first blow with a pick and Joseph G. Armstrong Jr. lifting the first shovel of dirt. Both the pick and the shovel were later silver plated and preserved as mementos in the office of the Mayor.[9][10] Following significant progress in construction a cornerstone laying ceremony was planned to coincide with the celebration of Pittsburgh's Centennial.[11] On March 26, 1916, the celebration of the 100th anniversary of incorporation was held in Pittsburgh and a parade wound through downtown Pittsburgh ending at a steel-framework of what would become the new City-Council Building. Three cornerstones were laid during the celebration, including one for the City, one for the County, and one for the workers, each of which contained time capsules.[12][13][14] The construction on the new building finished in 1917, and was completed under budget.[15] In April 1917, the City Law Department was the first to switch into the new building, with the rest of the remaining offices allocated by June.[16] The building was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Site by Preservation Pittsburgh. Architecture[edit] In 1914, a competition was held for a new Pittsburgh City Hall. The 16-entry competition led to the commissioning of Edward B. Lee, a respected Pittsburgh architect, with Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones as associated architects. The completed design was done by Henry Hornbostel.[17] The building was designed in the Beaux Arts style, with elements of the City Beautiful Movement. The City-County building is a representation of a distinctly American extrapolation of the Beaux Arts mode.[18] Hornbostel was known for this architectural style, and architectural historian James Van Trump has stated that Hornbostel kept the principles of the Beaux Arts central with his designs, but also frequently departed from the precepts, and integrated elements of other styles akin to industrially-inspired brutalism.[19] The design of the building was also influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. This movement featured urban planning with soaring Neoclassical buildings, clean and orderly designs, and included the concept of the \"White City\". The City-County Building was one of Pittsburgh's first attempts at incorporating the City Beautiful Movement into its urban design.[20] Some of the most significant design elements of the building include the Grand Lobby, which is a naturally lit atrium with a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The ceiling is held up by bronze columns crafted by Louis Tiffany Studios. They feature at their bases, the Seals of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, frontiersman Guyasuta, and Pittsburgh's oldest surviving building, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse. The room's ornate elevator doors feature a series of reliefs detailing the previous homes of municipal government. The reliefs age with the buildings they clutch, reaching adulthood with the present City-County Building and Allegheny County Courthouse.[21] The building is also unique in that most of the furniture was designed by the building's architect, Hornbostel. The Office of the Mayor, Council Chamber, and Supreme Court Room all feature 1917 furniture still in use today. On the seventh floor of the building is a massive mural completed in 1940 entitled \"Justice\" by award-winning artist Harry Scheuch.[22] Gallery[edit] City-Council Building as it looks today from the front City-Council Building from an angled view Older photo of Pittsburgh City-Council Building Old photo of the main elevation of the City-Council Building Close-up of the City-Council Building Popular culture[edit] Pittsburgh Pirates great and future Hall of Famer Honus Wagner helped promote the 1922 film In the Name of the Law by catching baseballs thrown off the roof of City Hall.[23][24] Mayor Magee and the City Hall were featured in 1924's Fording the Lincoln Highway.[25] 1992's Lorenzo's Oil used the building to shoot scenes depicting Johns Hopkins Hospital.[26] Many scenes of the Bruce Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker 1993 police drama Striking Distance were filmed both inside and on the Grant Street entrance to the building. Most notable is the nighttime scene of Dennis Farina's supervisor character arguing with Willis' \"Tom Hardy\" over the \"Polish Hill\" documents. Scenes of the 1997–98 Superman remake Superman Lives were slated to be filmed in the building's \"crystal palace\" grand mezzanine and serving as Daily Planet offices but production was delayed by Warner Brothers.[27] Trivia[edit] The downtown branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh occupied space in the structure until November, 1930.[28] See also[edit] List of state and county courthouses in Pennsylvania References[edit] ^ Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh's North Side.

H. Richardson. The buildings are considered among the finest examples of the Romanesque Revival style for which Richardson is well known. The complex is bordered by wide thoroughfares named for city founders James Ross (Ross Street), John Forbes (Forbes Avenue) and James Grant (Grant Street). The current building, completed in 1888, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.[4] Richardson later referred to it as his \"great achievement\".[8] Early structures[edit] Second Courthouse, Pittsburgh, in 1857. This courthouse was ruined by fire in 1882 Pittsburgh's original courthouse, first occupied in 1794, was a wooden structure located on one side of Market Square. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and from December 7, 1818, until 1841 the Western District of Pennsylvania also held court sessions at Market Square.[9] Land for a new courthouse was purchased in April 1834. This was a tract of land on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Grant Street, on Grant's Hill. Construction took place between 1836 and 1840. This court house was built with polished gray sandstone, quarried at Coal Hill (present-day Mount Washington), opposite Water Street along the Monongahela River. The building was designed by John Chislett. The Greek Revival design included a domed cupola housing a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high. The building was completed in 1841. The building's second floor again served as the headquarters for both the Commonwealth Supreme Court Pittsburgh region and the Federal Western District, serving the latter until a new U.S. Customs House/Post Office opened on Fifth and Smithfield in 1853.[9] Due to corrosion caused by coal smoke, the building deteriorated: the dressed surface of the facade dropped off, some of the cornices near the roof began to fall, and the building had a scaly appearance. On May 7, 1882, a fire broke out and destroyed the building. Subsequently, it was demolished. The third, and present, courthouse was erected on the same spot.[10] Current structure[edit] Following the destruction of the second courthouse, Allegheny County Commissioners decided to hold a competition to design a replacement. The winner of the competition was Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and construction of the buildings was begun by the Norcross Brothers, Richardson's construction firm of choice, in 1884. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 13, 1884. The design of the main building, which Richardson considered to be his finest, was innovative in that the building is built around an interior courtyard, thus allowing natural light and fresh air to reach most of the building. The courtyard is surrounded by four stories in three sides. A tower rises five stories from the courtyard's open side. As was usually the case with Richardson's buildings, the roof is steep with dormers placed at all the corners. The building's roof is covered with Ludowici clay tiles.[11] A prison is connected to the courthouse via the \"Bridge of Sighs\". The design was based on the Bridge of Sighs in Venice. The entire complex was built of large rusticated blocks of granite, with the entrance ways and windows topped with wide arches. This gives the building a heavy, stable and dignified appearance. In the 1900s the street level in front of the building was lowered as part of a general re-grading of Pittsburgh.[12] Richardson had anticipated this and courses of finished masonry had been buried underground, now to be revealed. This left the ceremonial entrance a full story above the street. A grand stairway was built, but removed during street widening in the 1930s- the low arched doorways were extended downwards to street level, with the result that the visitor is not greeted by the grand entrance hall Richardson planned, but by the low corridors which were once the basement. Muralist Vincent Nesbert completed five murals for the building on its first floor in 1937: \"Industry\", \"Justice\", \"Peace\", \"Fort Duquesne\" and \"The Battle of Grant's Hill.\"[13] In 1973, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.[4] A new jail was built by Allegheny County in 1995 near the Allegheny River. The old jail underwent a transformation to become the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.[14] The conversion, which cost approximately $25 million and took two years to complete, aimed to retain key elements of the jail like the rotunda, the cell blocks, and the warden's office.[15] A part of the old cell block is now home to the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum, exhibiting jail history and artifacts.[14] The restoration work involved asbestos removal, new plumbing and electrical systems installation, air conditioning addition, and new offices and courtrooms creation. It also encompassed the preservation of the historic elements like the stone facade, the ironwork, and the stained glass windows. The conversion project earned multiple awards for adaptive reuse and historic preservation, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation Honor Award in 2002 and the American Institute of Architects Pittsburgh Chapter Award in 2001.[15] Legacy and impact[edit] The design of the Allegheny County Courthouse has influenced buildings in many cities across North America, such as Toronto City Hall,[16] Minneapolis City Hall,[17] the Milwaukee Federal Building,[18] Altgeld Hall on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and James W. McLaughlin's Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond, Indiana. In 2007, the American Institute of Architects asked Harris Interactive to survey 2,000 people, who were shown 247 photographs of buildings and other structures in different categories chosen by 2,500 architects. The Allegheny County Courthouse was ranked 35th overall on the list and above every other courthouse in the nation except the United States Supreme Court Building.[19] In popular culture[edit] Several big-budget films have portrayed the Courthouse. Striking Distance and Hoffa primarily used interior shots, while Desperate Measures and The Next Three Days used both interior and exterior shots, with Boys on the Side and Mrs. Soffel featuring the Ross Street side of the complex and the \"Bridge of Sighs\".

As of the 2021–2022 school year, the district operates 54 schools with 4,192 employees (2,070 teachers) and 20,350 students, and has a budget of $668.3 million.[3] According to the district's 2021 budget, based on the 2010 U.S. census, the combined land area served is 55.3 square miles (143 km2), with a population of 309,359.[4] History[edit] The formation of Pittsburgh's public schools in 1835 was due to the passing of the Pennsylvania Free Public School Act of 1834. This act provided government aid for establishing a city school system, which included the creation of four self-governed wards. Twenty years later, the wards were disbanded, and the Central Board of Education was founded. This board would govern the entire school district, which would consist of nine wards or sub- districts. The first city superintendent of schools was elected in 1868. In 1911, the School Code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania modified the existing system to include a Board of Public education that would oversee sixty-one sub-districts and two central boards. The Public School Code (Title 22) of 1949 further regulated the provisions and establishment of Pennsylvania state schools.[1] As stated in numerous district annual budgets, including 2021, \"Although public education in Pittsburgh dates back to 1835, the consolidated District was founded in November 1911, as a result of an educational reform movement that combined the former 'ward' schools into one system with standardized educational and business policies. Initially the district was governed by an appointed Board of 15 members, but since 1976 has been governed by a nine-member Board elected by districts of relatively equal populations.\"[4] Academics[edit] In February 2006, eight underperforming schools were transformed into Accelerated Learning Academies (ALAs).[5][6] The schools had 10 days added to their school calendar and 45 minutes of instructional time were added each day.[7][8] The ALAs use the America's Choice Design Model,[9] developed by the National Center on Education and the Economy. In March 2006, the district contracted with Kaplan K12 Learning Services to develop a single, district-wide curriculum.[10] The Pittsburgh Promise[edit] On December 13, 2006 Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and then Superintendent Mark Roosevelt announced an initiative called The Pittsburgh Promise. In 2008, the program became available to all graduates satisfying the criteria for a scholarship to any accredited post-secondary institution within Pennsylvania. The five to seven million dollars per year necessary to fund the program would be raised through private contributions from foundations and corporations.[11][12] In January 2007, the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers made the first contribution to The Pittsburgh Promise scholarship program.[13] In 2008, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center made a $10 million donation with a commitment for as much as $90 million in additional matching funds over the next nine years.[14] Since its founding, the program has helped nearly 12,000 students attend college by funneling $170 million into fees, tuition, and living expenses.[15] In September 2023, the Pittsburgh Promise's executive director, Saleem Ghubril, sent a letter to district parents explaining that the Pittsburgh Public Schools' Class of 2028 will be the final group of students to receive scholarships.[16] Board of Public Education of Pittsburgh[edit] The Pittsburgh Public Schools has an elected, nine-member board of directors. The members serve a four-year term and represent districts within the city and the nearby borough of Mount Oliver.[17] Like all other school board members in Pennsylvania, they receive no pay.[18] Superintendent of Schools and Administration[edit] On July 21, 2022, the Pittsburgh Board of Education announced that Dr. Wayne N. Walters will serve as Superintendent of Pittsburgh Public Schools.[19] On August 1, 2022, Dr. Walters took over the top leadership position after serving as interim Superintendent for a 10-month period. The school district has various administrative departments: Office of the Superintendent, Student Support Services, Athletics, Human Resources, Curriculm and Instruction, Data, Research, Evaluation and Assessment, Facilities, Finance, and Law.

Lawrence Convention Center, North Shore Riverfront Park, PPG Paints Arena, and the North Shore Parking Garage.[2] In July 1998, the SEA developed the \"Destination Financing Plan\" to encourage Pittsburgh's image as a travel destination.[2] The plan financed the complete redesign and expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center as well as the construction of PNC Park and Acrisure Stadium. The $1 billion in funds for these projects was raised from hotel tax and sales tax revenues, ticket surcharges for Pittsburgh Steelers tickets, parking revenues, state appropriations, federal funds, corporate funds, foundation money, and team contributions.[2] In July 2013, the SEA along with the Pittsburgh Penguins plan to submit a proposal to City Council that will revitalize the 28 acres on which the Mellon Arena sat. This will likely include 1,100-1,200 housing units, 200,000 square feet of retail, 600,000 square feet of office space, and will likely be LEED N-D certified.[3] References[edit] ^ \"Media - Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County\".

History[edit] The Bureau started out as a volunteer fire department and officially transitioned to a fully paid department on May 23, 1870.[5] Over 30 years later in 1903 a group of Pittsburgh firefighters sought to improve working and living conditions of those serving in the department. They formed an association known as the City Fireman's Protective Association. By September 1903, the first International Association of Fire Fighters union was organized, IAFF Local No. 1.[5] Stations and apparatus[edit] The quarters of Engine 3 in the Strip District Below is a complete listing of all fire station and apparatus locations in the city of Pittsburgh according to Battalion.

Its main branch is located in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and it has 19 branch locations throughout the city. Like hundreds of other Carnegie libraries, the construction of the main library, which opened in 1895, and several neighborhood branches, was funded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The Pittsburgh area houses the first branches in the United States. The Pittsburgh Photographic Library is a photography repository held by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh of over 50,000 prints and negatives relating to history of Pittsburgh. History[edit] The City of Pittsburgh was originally home to eight Carnegie libraries constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1881, Andrew Carnegie offered a US$250,000 grant to the city for the construction of a public library on the condition that the city provided the land and annual funding for the maintenance of the property.[4] The city declined Carnegie's initial offer out of concern that a publicly funded library was not a state-sanctioned use of public tax funds. With the passing of several years and the state legislature's endorsement of the project, however, the city reconsidered the offer and reached out to Carnegie in the interest of accepting his grant.[4] In 1890, the City of Pittsburgh accepted an expanded grant of $1 million for the building of the main library in Oakland and five branches in the neighborhoods of Lawrenceville, West End, Wylie Avenue (Hill District), Mount Washington, and Hazelwood.[5] While the initial plan only called for those five branches, the city later received another three Carnegie libraries in the East Liberty, South Side, and Homewood neighborhoods. Construction on the main library was finished in 1895 while the branch libraries were constructed over the following fifteen years, ending with the completion of the Homewood branch in 1910.[5] Six of the original Carnegie library branch locations continue to serve as public libraries in their respective neighborhoods: Lawrenceville, West End, Mount Washington, Hazelwood, South Side, and Homewood. The East Liberty branch was demolished in the 1960s as part of a redevelopment plan, and the Wylie Avenue branch was moved to a new location in 1982.[4] In January 2022, the 201 members of the United Library Workers (ULW), the union of library staff, which organized with United Steelworkers in 2019, ratified their first contract with the library's management.[6] Environmental service workers and drivers had already been unionized with the Teamsters and SEIU.[7] Branches/Locations[edit] Allegheny Allegheny County Law Library Beechview Brookline Carrick Downtown and Business East Liberty Hazelwood Hill District Homewood Knoxville Lawrenceville Library of Accessible Media for Pennsylvanians (formerly Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped) (Bloomfield) Main (Oakland) Mt. Washington Sheraden South Side Squirrel Hill West End Woods Run Partnership with suburban branches[edit] For decades, CLP has partnered with suburban area branches, and, in 2014, talks were started seeking innovative ways to combine some services.[8] Theft case[edit] In 2018, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that nearly 320 rare books, maps, engravings, and other items had been stolen from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's main branch in Oakland, which houses the system's rare book collection.[9] The items, including a 1787 document signed by Thomas Jefferson, were valued at more than $8 million. In July 2018, a former library archivist and a Pittsburgh-area bookseller were charged with the thefts, which took place over a period of two decades.[10] It was one of the largest rare-book theft cases in history.[10] According to the criminal complaints detailing alleged scheme, the archivist said that he \"often removed items from the Oliver Room at the library's main branch in Oakland by carrying individual plates [and] maps in manila folders, or for books or larger items, by brazenly rolling them up and walking out.\" The archivist is alleged to have turned the rare items over to the bookseller, who would then sell them through his store.[10] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

After the borough was rechartered as a city, its first seven mayors were selected in a similar fashion as the chief burgesses had been under borough council. It was not until Mayor Samuel Pettigrew in the 1830s that general elections of popular vote were conducted among all the city's voters to determine who would hold the mayor's office. Pettigrew was both the last mayor selected by council and the first generally elected mayor of Pittsburgh. From 1901 to 1903 the state legislature took control of the city on the grounds of corruption by former Mayor William J. Diehl with the passage of the so-called \"ripper bill\" and appointed the unelected \"recorders\" Joseph Brown and Adam Brown, who were answerable only to the state government. Since 1903, all mayors have been popularly elected. The mayor as of January 2022[update] is Democrat Ed Gainey.

The modern force of salaried and professional officers was founded in 1857 but dates back to the night watchmen beginning in 1794, and the subsequent day patrols in the early 19th century, in the then borough of Pittsburgh. By 1952 the Bureau had a strength of 1,400 sworn officers;[3] in July 1985, 1,200;[4] and by November 1989, 1,040.[5] Organization[edit] The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is part of the Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety, along with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (PEMS). It is headed by Chief Martin Devine (acting)[2] appointed by Mayor Ed Gainey. The Chief of Police is the top law enforcement agent of the city of Pittsburgh. In the Chiefs council are the positions of Deputy Chief of Police Bureau Chief of Staff of the Police Bureau Public Affairs Manager of the Police Bureau Legal Advisor to the Police Bureau Reporting directly through the Deputy Chief of Police to the Chief are the three active units of the Police Bureau: Operations, Investigations, and Administration. Each one is headed by an Assistant Chief. Headquarters[edit] The original headquarters were at Sixth Avenue and William Penn Way in downtown. In 1918 it moved into the Pittsburgh City-County Building, 1925 to Water Street,[6] 1960s Grant Street Public Safety Building, and is now quartered at Western Avenue on the Northside. Operations Unit[edit] Headed by the Assistant Chief of Operations, this unit is the most visible arm of the Pittsburgh Police Bureau. It consists six zones (the updated form of precincts) with each zone being supervised by the zone commander, as well as all zone patrol and response operations, SWAT team, Traffic Patrol, and Impound. This is also the unit that does community policing. Zone One: North Side Zone Two: Downtown, Hill District, Strip District, Lawrenceville, Polish Hill, Uptown Zone Three: South Side, Beltzhoover, Carrick, St. Clair Village, Arlington Heights Zone Four: Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Point Breeze Zone Five: East Liberty, Highland Park, Homewood Zone Six: West End, Banksville, Brookline, Beechview In 2010 the average Pittsburgh police zone had 12.8 officers, 2.8 detectives, 1.2 sergeants and .5 lieutenants on duty during any 8-hour shift.[1] Citywide for any 8-hour 2010 shift this translates to 76.8 officers, 16.8 detectives, 7.2 sergeants and 3 lieutenants. In 1918 the city debuted a mounted squad, having had some mounted officers as early as 1906. Police motorcycles were first used by the bureau starting in 1910.[6] Investigations Unit[edit] Headed by the Assistant Chief of Investigations, Lavonnie Bickerstaff, this unit overlays the operations staff with the detective and inspector corps of the Police Bureau. Its detective divisions are broken down into the following: Auto Task Force Arson Squad Burglary Squad Crime Stoppers Crime Scene Investigation Dignitary & Witness Security Financial Crimes Task Force Forfeiture Gang Task Force Homicide Squad Missing Persons Narcotics Night Felony Squad Nuisance Bar Task Force Pawn Robbery Squad Sex Assault/Domestic Violence Squad Union[edit] Pittsburgh Police officers are members of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge (branch) 1. Administration Unit[edit] Headed by the Assistant Chief of Administration, this is the least visible unit of the bureau but one that is possibly the most essential. It consists of eight major divisions.

After an investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice joined the suit in January 1997, stating \"that there is a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police that deprives persons of rights, privileges, and immunities secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States\".[8] After a brief court challenge, the city entered into a consent decree with the federal government in April 1997 that outlined the steps that it would take to improve its conduct. The decree was lifted from the Police Bureau in 2001, and from the Office of Municipal Investigation in 2002.[9] Community activists in Pittsburgh successfully used a referendum to create an independent review board in 1997.[10] A study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001 found that 70% of Pittsburgh's African-American residents believe it either \"very common\" or \"somewhat common\" for \"police officers in Pittsburgh to use excessive force\" and that only 48% feel that the police are doing a \"very good\" or \"somewhat good\" \"job of fighting crime\", while 77% of white residents responded so.[9] In February 2013, the FBI and IRS seized boxes of documents from police headquarters and the independent police credit union concerning thousands of deposits and withdrawals of taxpayer money from unauthorized accounts.[11][12][13] Allegations have been made against former Chief Nate Harper, who was forced to resign on February 20, 2013 due to the FBI and IRS investigations. On March 22, a Federal Grand Jury indicted Harper for stealing over $31,000 in taxpayer money as well as not filing personal income tax returns for years 2008-2011. Harper had various checks deposited into these unauthorized secret accounts that were skimmed off a police fund, and then he used a debit card to withdraw cash as well as use the debit card to spend lavishly on food and alcohol in high-end restaurants, buy a satellite radio, gift cards, perfume, and even an oven upgrade. The full indictment was published by local media.[14] Two Pittsburgh Police vehicles parked at Market Square. In the foreground, a Ford Taurus Police Interceptor with the fleet's new livery, while in the background is a Chevrolet Impala displaying the Bureau's old livery. Uniforms and equipment[edit] Officers generally wear a very dark navy blue almost appearing to be black uniform. Officers with the rank of lieutenant and above no longer wear white uniform shirts, as all officers wear a navy blue uniform shirt, and white shirts and dress blouses are reserved for ceremonial occasions. SWAT and Tactical units wear olive drab green uniforms. Name tags are either embroidered or the traditional nameplate. Some officers will wear a very dark navy blue/black tie, but this is not a requirement for normal duties. They will also sometimes wear a traditional service cap, with a unique Sillitoe tartan (explained below). Officers are equipped with O.C. spray (Mace), police radio, duty belt, handcuffs, extra ammunition, service pistol, bulletproof vest, baton, first aid kit, and flashlight. Many officers are now carrying tasers.[15] The new Chief, Public Safety Director, and Mayor along with a department uniform committee have been making a myriad of changes to uniforms and equipment. One of the most visible changes being a black crew neck undershirt in lieu of the previous V-neck worn with the summer short sleeve shirts. This was a compromise after officers were originally told they would have to wear ties with the short sleeve shirts. A controversial change occurred in 2014 when officers were no longer permitted to wear outer ballistic vests as the administration deemed it looked too 'aggressive'. This was reversed and officers are now permitted to wear external plate carriers. The department is planning to implement the use of body cameras on officers, and are already on some officers in a limited trial basis. Batons[edit] Some officers carry expandable batons, and some officers carry more traditional wooden straight batons. These batons sometimes are connected to a leather strap. Service pistols[edit] Service pistols are usually Glocks. An officer must purchase his/her own service pistol. If officers were hired with the bureau in or prior to the year 1992, they have the option to carry a revolver on duty. Officers hired in 1993 and after must carry a semi-automatic pistol on duty. Prior to 1985 all officers could carry was a .38 caliber 5 or 6 shot revolver. In 1985 the bureau phased in the use of 9 mm semi-automatics to Special Operations and Narcotics units. In early 1990 all officers were allowed and encouraged to carry 9 mm semi-automatics, with the training and ammunition changeover costing the city roughly $2 million.[5] Hat bands[edit] The Pittsburgh police wear hats with checkered bands, which are dark navy blue and gold in color, popularly known as the \"Sillitoe tartan\" and named after its originator, Percy J. Sillitoe, Chief Constable of Glasgow, Scotland, in the 1930s. While the checkered band is a common police symbol in the United Kingdom, Australia and some European countries, the Chicago Police Department, Cook County Sheriff's Police, the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police are the only police forces in the United States that have adopted it as part of their uniforms. As recently as July 1930, police were required to wear a 13-ounce hat.[16] Pittsburgh Police medals[edit] The Pittsburgh Police have several honors and medals including: Medal of Valor The highest honor of any Pittsburgh Police officer. It is awarded only for acts occurring in the most exceptional of circumstances. Recognizing acts of bravery and heroism in the protection of life, while taking on great personal risk and without compromising any bureau mission. Valor Ribbon: Awarded along with the Medal of Valor. Commendation: Open to members and non-members of the Pittsburgh Police Bureau who have displayed initiative in performing tasks above and beyond that which is required in a professional manner. In 2007 38 officers received Commendations. Purple Heart: To those who in the course of criminal apprehension efforts, sustained serious injury, disability or wounds. In 2007 three officers received this award. Meritorious Service: Open to all officers who have distinguished themselves in exhibiting professional excellence in their tasks or duties. As well as those that contribute significantly towards improving the objectives of the bureau. In 2007 sixteen officers received this award. Bureau of Police Citation: Open to all officers and non-members who performed a task of bravery or heroism above and beyond the call of duty and in the face of great personal risk in life-saving or life-protecting circumstances. In 2007 nine officers were recognized. Officer of the Month: Selected by committee of the Chief, Deputy Chief and three Assistant Chiefs from a single nomination from each zone commander, there can be more than one selected per month. Officer of the Year: Selected from all officers of the months and all officers receiving commendations through the year by committee of the Chief, Deputy Chief and all three Assistant Chiefs. 2009 shootout[edit] Main article: 2009 shooting of Pittsburgh police officers On April 4, 2009, three Pittsburgh police officers were killed in the line of duty while responding to a domestic disturbance in the Stanton Heights area of the city. The officers, all from Zone 5 are Eric Kelly, a 14-year veteran of the Bureau, Stephen Mayhle, and Paul Sciullo II, both two-year veterans.[17] Two other officers were injured. Timothy McManaway was shot in the hand trying to help Officer Kelly, and Brian Jones broke his leg when a fence collapsed.[18] Police Chief Nathan Harper said Officer Mayhle was married and had two children; Officer Kelly was married and had three children; and Officer Sciullo was single.

Although the Pittsburgh Steelers are the only team to have these colors throughout their entire history (starting in 1933), the Pittsburgh Pirates (1948-present) and the Pittsburgh Penguins (1967, 1975, 1980–present) have for generations also been associated with \"black and gold\". However, the very first team in the city's history to associate with its official seal/flag colors were the original NHL franchise Pittsburgh Pirates. The police department of Pittsburgh was instrumental in establishing the \"black and gold\" tradition for the region's sports teams, in that the team's owner, attorney James Callahan, asked his police officer brother for used and surplus seals and emblems from old police uniforms in 1925. From those donated \"logos\" the tradition of \"black and gold\" for the city's franchises was born.[20][21] The Pittsburgh Police have been featured in many television and film portrayals. Among them: Television[edit] Vic Cianca, a traffic cop, was featured in Candid Camera winning an annual prize from the show in 1965 and subsequently featured in Budweiser commercials, on Italian TV and a cameo in Flashdance.

The Guardian: Simon Baker, Dabney Coleman and Farrah Fawcett (along with a cameo by Will Ferrell) all work with the police and are the subject of some police investigations in this deep drama about life and redemption. Sirens: mid-1990s ABC series about female Pittsburgh Police officers. The Kill Point: 2007 cable mini-series in which the Pittsburgh Police led by Donnie Wahlberg and the FBI attempt to handle a downtown bank robbery led by John Leguizamo that turns into a hostage situation. Blacks and Blue: 1998 NBC News series with Geraldo Rivera reporting on the bureau's operations.[22] Top Sniper 2: the Pittsburgh Police S.W.A.T. team was featured as winners of the 2008 competition with it airing on the Military Channel in March 2009.[23][24] Stranger Things, at the beginning of episode one, bank robbers are chased by the Pittsburgh Police in 1984. Film[edit] Flashdance features several Pittsburgh cops during different scenes, most notably candid camera fame Vic Cianca's cameo appearance with star Jennifer Beals.

The Port of Pittsburgh is a vast river traffic region in southwestern Pennsylvania. It spans a thirteen-county area including Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Clarion, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties. It encompasses more than 200 miles of commercially navigable waterways in southwestern Pennsylvania, including the three major rivers in this region: the Allegheny, the Monongahela, and the Ohio. These waterways are made navigable by a system of seventeen locks and dams. The Port of Pittsburgh supports nearly 200 river terminals and barge industry service suppliers, including privately owned public river terminals. The port complex is served by the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads and by four interstate highways. The Port of Pittsburgh Commission acts as a comprehensive service for shippers and industries seeking information on the river system. Unlike the Port of Miami, for example, the Port of Pittsburgh does not refer to a specific geographic location but to the broader geographical context under which the Pittsburgh port industry conducts its broad scope of activity.[1] Port of Pittsburgh Commission[edit] Not to be confused with Port Authority of Allegheny County.

The port ranked 15th largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[4] M-70[edit] The Commission has responsibility for Ohio River shipping within Pennsylvania and the navigable portions of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River. The federal Maritime Administration designated the Ohio River as part of a new federal marine highway, called M-70, with the name taken from I-70, a major highway used by trucks in the region.[5] See also[edit] Port of Philadelphia References[edit] ^ \"Port of Pittsburgh Commission\".

It grew from efforts in the 1940s to coordinate improvements to regional transportation and the local environment. During World War II, the Pittsburgh Regional Planning Association President Richard King Mellon, Carnegie Institute of Technology President Robert Doherty, and others organized local leaders to create a postwar planning committee. Pittsburgh Mayor David L. Lawrence and Allegheny County Commissioner John Kane were early recruits. The Allegheny Conference was officially established in 1944. The city's most visible problem in the first half of the 20th century was air pollution. The Conference brokered an agreement for phased-in implementation of smoke control that became city policy. After the Conference voiced its concern for legal loopholes to the state legislature in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a comprehensive anti-pollution law was passed in 1949 for Allegheny County. The clearer skies over the city both attracted new business and encouraged local corporations to retain and expand their Pittsburgh headquarters. The pollution-control program explicitly influenced the decision of the Equitable Life Assurance Society to invest in planning the Gateway Center project, a keystone of economic revitalization in Downtown Pittsburgh during Renaissance I. This also led to the development of Point State Park. The Conference also played a role in the appropriation of funds for the construction of flood control dams on the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. In the 1940s and 1950s, mass transit in Allegheny County was in jeopardy because of 40 private transit companies and increased competition from cars. The Conference released a report in 1951 calling for all local transit lines to be under one authority. Public suspicions and private interests delayed the measure until service cutbacks and strikes rekindled the idea in 1957. The Conference was instrumental in building public and private support. In 1959, legislation was passed to create the Port Authority of Allegheny County, and the first buses were rolling in 1964.[1] Allegheny Conference is a longtime partner with the RIDC.[2] In 1981 it formed the Regional Economic Development Committee with the RIDC that included \"18 of the region's top corporate executives\".[3] The Conference also led the transformation of the 14-block Penn-Liberty Corridor into the Pittsburgh Cultural District. A related effort was Strategy 21 that enabled public and private agencies in Allegheny County to speak with one voice when requesting state funds. Strategy 21 not only resulted in projects that ranged from the new Pittsburgh International Airport to The Andy Warhol Museum. In 2001, the Conference entered into a strategic affiliation with the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Pennsylvania Economy League of Southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance (PRA), with the four organizations merging many staff positions in 2003.

It is the second-largest public transit agency in Pennsylvania and the 20th-largest in the United States.[3] PRT operates an integrated system of bus, light rail and funicular services in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, with limited service to three adjacent counties in the Greater Pittsburgh region. The agency was founded in 1956 as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, and began operating transit service in 1964. PRT pioneered bus rapid transit in the United States with the opening of the South Busway in 1977, and continues to operate bus rapid transit services as a core part of its network. In 2024, the system had a ridership of 37,603,800. The agency changed its public-facing brand to Pittsburgh Regional Transit in 2022, although it is still legally and commonly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County. The agency is constituted as a port authority under Pennsylvania law, and is funded by state, local, and federal funds.[4] PRT is led by a professional CEO, who is overseen by a board of directors appointed by Allegheny County, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and the Governor of Pennsylvania. PRT's customer service center and corporate headquarters are located in the Heinz 57 Center in Downtown Pittsburgh.[5] History[edit] Pittsburgh Regional Transit was created as the Port Authority of Allegheny County by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1956 to allow for creation of port facilities in the Pittsburgh area and originally had the shortened name of PAT instead of PRT.[6][7] Three years later, the legislation was amended to allow the Port Authority to acquire privately owned transit companies that served the area. This included the Pittsburgh Railways Company and 32 independent bus and incline operations.[8] On April 19, 1963, the Board of Allegheny County Commissioners authorized the acquisition of 32 transit companies, including the Pittsburgh Railway Company, which had provided bus and streetcar service to Pittsburgh since January 1902, and an incline plane company, for about $12 million.[6] On March 1, 1964, Port Authority Transit began service.[9] Port Authority light rail train, Washington Junction Station, March 2005 Shortly after the Port Authority began service, 150 GM \"Fishbowl\" buses were introduced to replace aging ones acquired from its predecessors, a new route numbering convention was introduced, and the fare system was streamlined.[9] Due to urban sprawl, the agency introduced new routes that served new communities.[6] In the following years, additional buses were ordered and several new transit garages opened.[9] Many of the trolley lines acquired from Pittsburgh Railways were abandoned, and turned into bus lines, with only the South Hills lines via Beechview and Overbrook retained.[10] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Port Authority hoped to introduce a modern rapid transit system known as Skybus with rubber-tired vehicles running on rails, but the plan fell through.[11] In the early 1970s, the Port Authority entered what was dubbed by its fans the \"Mod\" era, with buses repainted in splashy paint schemes.[12] Several new flyer routes and routes to Oakland's university core were introduced as part of a new general marketing strategy.[12] In 1975 the Port Authority took over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad commuter rail line to Versailles, which it branded PATrain.[13] These new routes, coupled with the 1973 oil crisis, generated a major increase in ridership.[12] Due to the poor state of the economy at the time, fares increased and there was a brief strike in 1976.[14] In spite of these setbacks, the South Busway opened in 1977 and plans for other capital investments were made.[6] During the 1980s, with gas prices falling and population loss from the decline of the steel industry, ridership decreased and the agency lowered fares to attract new riders in the middle of the decade.[6] Many new buses were ordered, and the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway opened in 1983.[15] Also in the 1980s, construction began on the conversion of the remaining South Hills trolley lines to a modern light rail system.[6] A subway in Downtown Pittsburgh, a major component of the light rail system, opened in 1985. The Beechview line followed in 1987, and the Library line a year later.[15] In 1989, the agency celebrated its twenty-fifth year of existence, and commuter rail to Versailles was discontinued.[16] The agency was rocked by a four-week strike due to a labor dispute in 1992.[14] The strike, coupled with changing demographic patterns, caused a decrease in ridership.[6] New buses that were compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 were introduced early in the decade.[6] In 1993, the badly deteriorated Overbrook light rail line was shut down, requiring trains to use the Beechview line.[17] Several capital projects, such as the construction of a western busway and light rail extensions were considered.[6] In 1998, the agency rebranded itself as \"Ride Gold\" with new paint schemes and a new marketing campaign.[18] In 2000, the West Busway from the Ohio River to Carnegie was opened.[19] Shortly thereafter, new bus routes to outlying communities such as Cranberry were established.[20] In 2003, a short extension of the East Busway was completed.[21] The following year, the Overbrook light rail line was re-opened after a lengthy reconstruction.[17] Construction also started on a light rail extension to Pittsburgh's North Shore near Heinz Field, known as the North Shore Connector. In spite of the capital projects expansion, the agency was in serious financial trouble by the middle of the decade. In June 2007, the agency went through with a 15 percent service cut in order to cut the deficit.[22] In order to provide a dedicated source of funding, Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato introduced the controversial 10% Allegheny County Alcoholic Beverage Tax in 2008 to fund the agency.[23] Later that same year, another strike was narrowly averted.[24] The agency is planning a major service overhaul that will begin to go into effect in March 2010.[25] Pittsburgh Regional Transit pays $168,763 annually to Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney and $48,750 annually to Greenlee Partners to lobby the Pennsylvania General Assembly.[26] Funding crisis of 2010–12[edit] Between 2007 and 2010, Pittsburgh Regional Transit cut its annual expenses by $52 million and raised its revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a statewide transportation funding crisis.[27] The funding crisis only grew worse, however. The state legislature assumed it would receive permission to convert Interstate 80 into a toll road to increase revenues, but the federal government denied the request, leading to a gap in the state transportation budget of $472 million.[28] On November 24, 2010, Pittsburgh Regional Transit's board of directors approved a massive service cut and fare hike to go into effect in March 2011, reducing service hours by approximately 35 percent, including the elimination of 45 routes.[27] Pittsburgh Regional Transit's budget from the state was to be substantially reduced for 2011, and as chairperson Joan Ellenbogen noted, the PRT was legally required to adopt a balanced budget.[29][30][31] Twenty nine routes were removed, thirty seven reduced, and a bus maintenance facility shut down. By 2013, the Pennsylvania legislature approved Act 89, a dedicated transportation bill. Act 89 provided dedicated funding to Pittsburgh Regional Transit, which set the agency on more solid financial footing. One of the routes cut in 2011, the 55 Glassport, was restored in 2013.[32] The Pittsburgh Regional Transit brand[edit] The Steel Plaza subway station. Although Pat Transit is part of the local fans' folklore, its off-beat imaging is more notorious. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s the bus fleet was very recognizable with its fleet of air-conditioned GM \"Fishbowls\" (from their 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1971 orders) sporting a white top with small red strip.[9] Other noticeable features included side destination signs placed near the exit door and an unusual seating arrangement with one side facing forward and the other lining up to match the seating placed on the wheel well.[9] PAT would continue ordering buses in that specification until 1995 when they ordered buses with both seating sides facing front except when on wheel wells. The side destination signs were moved immediately to the left of the front door starting with the 1998 Neoplan AN-460 (articulated bus) order. This continued with the Neoplan Metroliner order but skipped the Neoplan AN-440LF order in 1999. The 2003 order of Gillig Advantage low-floors and all subsequent orders have conformed with the side sign next to front door configuration. It is worth noting that the 1980 GM's RTS buses acquired were specified with the current side sign configuration. By 1972 it entered what was dubbed by fans the \"Mod\" era, as buses were given flashy new paint schemes. Buses were painted with color at the front and rear, slanted to line up with the windows, and a large white portion in between.[12] In the 1980s, the classic 1960s white and red strip look was updated with a larger red strip accompanied by a black strip painted around the window area, while a white background covered most of the bus exterior.[15] This color scheme was in existence for roughly 20 years on the Flxible and NovaBus 'classics' series, although these buses were later repainted and refurbished into the uniform color livery up until their retirements. In 1998, PRT rebranded itself as \"Ride Gold\" to coincide with its 35th anniversary.[18] In the early 2000s, Pittsburgh Regional Transit buses included various transportation-related words and phrases repeated across the exterior, such as the words \"move\", \"go\" \"ride\" or \"connect\", combinations of \"rockin'\" and \"rollin'\", \"ziggin'\" and \"zaggin'\", or \"here\" and \"there\".[33] On September 21, 2006, the then-Port Authority announced that it was retiring the \"Ride Gold\" campaign and that the bus and light rail fleet will follow the standard design and uniform colors of its Gillig bus fleet.[18] The reason was the system's decision to return to a back-to-basics approach and to save costs on wholesale repainting and refurbishing. Their website began to use simple \"PORT AUTHORITY\" fonts, and some buses and light rail vehicles have been repainted with the standard \"Port Authority\" font. On June 9, 2022,[34] at Gateway Station, it was announced that the Port Authority of Allegheny County was rebranding due to their name being a misnomer. It was said that the new name better represented who they are and how they were viewed.[35] Fare structure[edit] On April 29, 2016, following several months of public hearings, Pittsburgh Regional Transit's board of directors voted unanimously to implement sweeping changes to the fare system in 2017, including a decrease in fares for some riders for the first time in over 35 years.[36][37] The new fare system eliminated the current zone-based fare collection in favor of a flat $2.50 single-ride fare for all riders who pay via ConnectCard, and $2.75 for those who pay with cash. The first transfer to another line made within three hours costs $1.00. Beginning January 1, 2022, ConnectCard users paid $2.75 single-fare ride with a three-hour free transfer period. Cash users still pay $2.75 per ride.[38] Riders between Zones 1 and 2 used to pay a single-ride fare of $3.75, one of the highest intra-urban fares in the country. Although doing so was estimated to lose $4 million in revenue for the agency, the 25-cent cash surcharge aims to recoup at least some of the losses, along with eliminating paper transfer tickets for cash fares and establishing a $2 surcharge for new or replacement ConnectCard purchases. These changes are also intended to discourage paying fares with cash in favor of increased ConnectCard use, which the agency also says will speed up trip times.[39] Seniors 65 years and older and up to three children below 6 ride for free with a fare-paying rider; disabled and Medicare users, as well as children ages 6 to 11, pay either $1.35 in cash or $1.25 with ConnectCard, and $0.50 for transfers. The agency also voted to abolish the \"pay enter/pay leave\" fare collection policy in favor of all riders simply paying their fare upon entering the bus regardless of destination, similar to the method used on most other American transit agencies. This change eliminated the free fare zone in downtown Pittsburgh, excluding rides on the \"T\" between Downtown and the North Shore which remain accessible for no charge. The agency also eventually plans to implement a proof of payment system, with riders required to scan their ConnectCards at kiosks on station platforms prior to boarding and Pittsburgh Regional Transit fare officers performing random inspections on board to ensure payment.[37] Previous fare system[edit] This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (October 2019) Pittsburgh Regional Transit used a fare structure based on four main zones (1, 1A, and 2). The downtown area was an unnumbered Free Fare Zone, established in 1985 to encourage transit use in downtown and reduce stop \"dwell\" times (the amount of time a transit vehicle must remain stopped for passengers to board or alight). All rides within the downtown zone are free, at all times on the light rail system (called the \"T\") and until 7 p.m. on buses, seven days a week.[40] Originally the free-fare zone applied only until 7 p.m. on both buses and light rail, but it was expanded to 24 hours on the latter in 1989. Zone 1 was the zone closest to downtown Pittsburgh, and Zone 2 comprised the outer half of Allegheny County and all stops outside of Allegheny County. A few routes cross briefly into neighboring counties. The system used an \"outbound\" pay system for daytime transit to and from downtown. Fare was paid when boarding on the \"outbound\" part of the route.[41] This applies only on buses that serve downtown; on most that do not serve downtown, the rider pays upon entry.[41] During the evening, on buses serving downtown, the method changes on many routes to \"pay when boarding\" (also known as \"pay enter\"), due to the possibility of riders trying to avoid paying the fare. In combination with the downtown Free Fare Zone, this fare collection system permits boarding to take place via all doors in downtown (except evenings), greatly reducing loading delays in the part of the system with the heaviest concentration of transit routes and passenger boarding per stop.[42] Pittsburgh Regional Transit sells non-discounted single-use tickets, and discounted weekly, monthly and annual passes.[43] Each carries a small discount over earlier time-based passes and is valid for an unlimited number of trips/transfers in the specified zone(s) for that time period. For example, for a zone 1 pass the cost of a weekly is the equivalent of 9.5 one-way trips, a monthly is equivalent to 34 trips, and an annual is equivalent to 377 trips. An annual pass is a 12-month subscription to monthly passes, which can be either mailed or picked up at the Downtown Service Center on Smithfield Street. Students and staff of several colleges in the area, most notably Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, ride the bus for free: students pay a fee each semester to the PRT.[44] Pittsburgh Regional Transit installed new fareboxes on all buses in 2011,[45] and has converted to a smart card fare collection system marketed as the \"ConnectCard\"[46][47][48] starting in early 2012.[45] The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University use the new farebox system by equipping their ID cards with a chip the farebox can scan and recognize. Because individuals affiliated with the Universities ride for \"free,\" the system serves only to authenticate the validity of the ID card, and no fares are calculated or assessed. Light rail[edit] The logo for Pittsburgh's subway and light rail system Main article: Pittsburgh Light Rail Pittsburgh Regional Transit operates a 26-mile (42 km) light rail system called the \"T\" from downtown subway stations to neighborhoods and suburbs south of the city on surface tracks with right-of-way. The system comprises three lines, all of which have a northern terminus at Allegheny station on Pittsburgh's North Shore near Acrisure Stadium and the Carnegie Science Center: The Red Line, which runs through Beechview, Dormont, Mt. Lebanon, Castle Shannon and Bethel Park before terminating at South Hills Village The Blue Line, which runs through Knoxville, Overbrook, Castle Shannon and Bethel Park before terminating at South Hills Village The Silver Line, which runs through Knoxville, Overbrook, Castle Shannon, Bethel Park and South Park before terminating at Library Funiculars[edit] Main articles: Monongahela Incline and Duquesne Incline Pittsburgh's mass transit system also includes two unique funiculars (called \"inclines\" locally) from the top of Mt. Washington to its base along the Monongahela River, just across from Downtown Pittsburgh. In 2024, the two inclines had a combined ridership of 904,300.[1] Both the Duquesne Incline and the Monongahela Incline have stations along Grandview Avenue atop Mt Washington and in the Station Square area at the base. The Duquesne Incline is owned by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, and The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline operates it as a non-profit organization. It has the original cars and the original stations. Buses[edit] See also: List of bus routes in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Regional Transit operates 700 buses, as of April 2014, in Allegheny County, and also service extends slightly into neighboring Beaver, Butler, Washington and Westmoreland counties. Some bus routes operate seven days a week between 4:00 am and 2:00 am, but many routes have more restricted hours, or do not operate on weekends, or on Sundays and holidays. In May 2001 the fleet installed its first bike racks, with all of its fleet being equipped with bike racks by 2011.[49][50] Bus rapid transit[edit] Herron station on the East Busway Main articles: South Busway, Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, and West Busway In December 1977, the Port Authority unveiled its first dedicated busway, the 4.3-mile South Busway, which combined bus and light rail routes into an efficient and quicker connection between downtown Pittsburgh and the South Hills area. The Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, which used express routes to connect downtown with nearby east side communities like Swissvale, Wilkinsburg and Homewood followed in February 1983. On Sunday, September 10, 2000, Port Authority opened its West Busway, which provides service from downtown Pittsburgh to Carnegie. In 2003, the East Busway was expanded by a few miles to Swissvale and Rankin. On July 22, 2011, the Port Authority approved spending at least $1 million, including $837,993 in federal funding and $209,498 in county money, to study developing a rapid bus line from Downtown to the Oakland section. The study was projected to take 18 months and use no money from Pittsburgh Regional Transit's operating budget.[51] The study resulted in planning for the new University Line which began construction in 2022. Rerouting existing bus routes and implementing other system changes began in October 2023.[52] Other services[edit] Pittsburgh Regional Transit operates more than 60 park-and-ride lots in Allegheny County. It owns 66 transit bridges, 11 highway bridges and four tunnels.[53] Under the PRT-sponsored ACCESS program, a private contractor provides door-to-door service to elderly and disabled passengers throughout the county, seven days a week from 6 a.m. to midnight. Reservations are placed one day in advance. The ACCESS program is noted as one of the first, most innovative and best in the nation.[54] Between 2001 and 2004 the Port Authority worked with the local community group Ground Zero to create and operate the \"Ultra Violet Loop\"; known to some as the \"party bus\", the UV Loop bus was special service operated on Friday and Saturday nights through the early morning, serving city nightlife and university centers.[55] The UV Loop bus was part of special evaluative service supported in part by local foundations and businesses. While it was well regarded in the abstract, it never achieved the ridership and consistent service needed to continue without external support. The \"Ultra Violet Loop\" name is a play on the Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System.[56] Future[edit] Potential capital expansions[edit] Several capital expansions have been proposed from various sources. The construction of a light rail line from Oakland to Pittsburgh International Airport has been proposed by County Executive Dan Onorato and former Congressman Mike Doyle, projected to cost about $3.5 billion.[57] Doyle submitted a request to the Federal government to study the feasibility of the project. Current finances[edit] Since 2007, Pittsburgh Regional Transit cut annual expenses by $52 million and raised revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a $472 million gap in the state transportation budget.[27][28] In late 2010, the PRT's board approved service cuts of 35% (45 routes) and fare increases.[27][29][30] The Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission approved a plan by Governor Ed Rendell to allocate $45 million for the Authority to help reduce service cuts to only 15% on March 27, 2011.[58][59] Since Governor Tom Corbett's 2012 budget, Pittsburgh Regional Transit has renewed plans to cut service by 35% if the state fails to help with a projected $64 million budget deficit.[60][61] See also[edit] Port Authority Police Department List of rapid transit systems Paul Skoutelas Dennis Veraldi SEPTA References[edit] ^ a b \"Transit Ridership Report Fourth Quarter 2024\" (PDF).

Pittsburgh WaterAgency overviewFormed17 February 1984[1]JurisdictionCity of PittsburghEmployees244 (as of Dec 2016)Agency executiveWill Pickering, Chief Executive OfficerWebsitehttp://www.pgh2o.com/ Pittsburgh Water, formerly the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), is a municipal authority in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[2] It is responsible for water treatment and delivery systems in the city of Pittsburgh, as well as the city's sewer system. In a 2010 report, the authority reported 80,557 drinking water service connections and 107,151 sewage connections.[3] The authority claims to serve approximately 83,000 customers.[4] It is estimated that there are 930 miles of water lines and 7,300 Fire Hydrants served by Pittsburgh Water. History[edit] The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority was created in 1984 to oversee a $200 million capital improvement program focused on Pittsburgh's water treatment and distribution system.[5] This capital improvement program was primarily designed to ensure that the water system would meet various new requirements mandated by federal and state laws pertaining to safe drinking water.[5] The largest project undertaken in the initial years of the PWSA was to cover all open water reservoirs, replace them with closed tanks, or else enact another acceptable solution, such as the installation of a membrane filtration plant at the open Highland Reservoir No. 1, which is the focal point of Highland Park.[5] The City of Pittsburgh Water Department was absorbed by the PWSA in 1995, and in 1999, the PWSA also assumed the responsibility of operating and maintaining Pittsburgh's sewer system.[5] In November 2024, the PWSA rebranded as Pittsburgh Water.[2] System statistics[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

However, exposure to lead is directly connected with multiple health problems, particularly in children. No lead is present in water that has been treated by Pittsburgh Water; lead only enters water through older service lines as it travels to buildings. Pittsburgh Water has been working in conjunction with local home and business owners to replace these pipes.[7] A more comprehensive and frequently-updated list of current projects may be found on Pittsburgh Water's main website.[8] Projects conducted by Pittsburgh Water typically involve updating older plumbing systems, building new lines, and creating greener solutions to stormwater issues such as parks.[9] See also[edit] Pennsylvania-American Water Company, which also serves Pittsburgh References[edit] ^ \"The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority 2008 Bond Issue\" (PDF).

Once the center of the American steel industry, and still known as \"The Steel City\", today the city of Pittsburgh has no steel mills within its limits, though Pittsburgh-based companies such as US Steel, Ampco Pittsburgh and Allegheny Technologies own several working mills in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Pittsburgh was chosen for the 2009 G-20 summit as its transformation is an example of a 21st-century economy. On September 8, 2009, President Barack Obama stated, \"Pittsburgh stands as a bold example of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century economy.\"[1] On the list of best cities for job growth in 2009, created by Tara Weiss, a writer for Forbes magazine, Pittsburgh secured its spot because of its strength in the health care and education industries with healthy foundations in technology or robotics and banking industries.[2] The 2009 list of all cities places Pittsburgh as the 169th-best city for job growth.[3] Pittsburgh has also ranked in the top five most livable cities in four of the seven multi-year rankings of Places Rated Almanac (1983, 1985, 1989, and 2007).[4] History[edit] Main article: History of Pittsburgh Early foundation[edit] Early look at Pittsburgh During the mid-18th century, the economy of the Pittsburgh region was focused on agriculture and trade. After the American Revolutionary War, the government placed a tax on whiskey in order to pay off national debt. In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion occurred in Pittsburgh and was the first challenge to the government.“The fledgling Federal government had decided to levy its first tax against whiskey, but the farmers argued they didn't have cash to pay taxes on bartered goods, and marched in protest. Washington had to send troops to squelch the protest and enforce the tax laws.”[5] During the 18th century, large coal deposits were discovered throughout Pittsburgh. Mount Washington, originally called \"Coal Hill\", the “most valuable deposit of bituminous coal in the entire United States, was discovered there in 1760”.[6] Along with the natural resources of the area, Pittsburgh was located at the intersection of the Monongahela, Ohio, and Allegheny Rivers, that is, along the major trade routes of the United States, thus making Pittsburgh \"one of the world's leading industrial powerhouses\". “The first and largest industry emerging in the 1800s was boat building—both flatboats to transport waves of pioneers and goods downriver, and keelboats, which a strong crew could propel upstream as well.” [5] The second biggest industry in the region was glass production. The first glass factory was built in 1795 by James O'Hara and Isaac Craig.[5] Nineteenth century[edit] Pittsburgh’s wealthiest industrialists during the 19th century all lived in a single neighborhood known as East Liberty. The major list of industrialists includes H. J. Heinz, George Westinghouse, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Mellon, Andrew Mellon, Henry Clay Frick and Philander Knox. All of these men shared similar ideas in the system of capitalism and utilized their skills to net the world’s highest income per capita during the 19th century in this single neighborhood.[7] Andrew Carnegie was also known as a philanthropist to the region. “In 1889 he wrote \"The Gospel of Wealth\", in which he asserted that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community”.[8] Subsequently, the Carnegie Library, which is free to the public, opened in Pittsburgh in 1890 and is still open presently.[9] Overall, Carnegie donated over $350 million for the establishment of organizations that benefit the public.[8] Wealthy industrialists founded the Duquesne Club in 1873 and the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce in 1874. The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was also formed in 1864 as the \"Oil Exchange\" before becoming the \"Coal Exchange\" in 1870 and then back to the \"Oil Exchange\" in 1878 until opening for all general stocks by 1894. The stock exchange closed its Fourth Avenue \"financial district\" doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York, Chicago and other global centers but not before a 1966 response from the New York Stock Exchange board of possibly relocating their trading floor to the city's facilities.[10] Railroad networks reached the Pittsburgh area in the mid-19th century. The Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad opened in 1851, which allowed passengers to travel through Allegheny and New Brighton while the Pennsylvania Railroad established \"Pittsburgh service\" as close as Turtle Creek from their Philadelphia hub that same year. A year later, in 1852, the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed to Downtown Pittsburgh. In 1856, the Allegheny Valley Railroad was built.[9][11] Andrew Carnegie was one of the first to capitalize on the railways; in 1865 he founded the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which would be an industry leader from the city until 1919. In 1892, the economy of Pittsburgh faced the Homestead Strike between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and the Carnegie Steel Company. After the workers' previous wage contract expired in 1892, and a new negotiation was not reached, a violent conflict ensued leaving several dead and wounded. Ultimately, The Carnegie Steel company won and had avoided union formation in Pittsburgh.[12] Emergence of \"Big Steel\"[edit] After Carnegie Steel was reorganized as U.S. Steel in 1901, it and J&L Steel dominated the local economy. Several secondary players contributed to the capacity of the metro area such as Cyclops Steel in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania from 1908 until 1987, Mesta Machinery in West Homestead, Pennsylvania from 1898 until 1983, Dravo Corporation at Neville Island, Pennsylvania until 1984,[13] National Steel Corporation until 1992, Wean United as an independent until 1993 (still maintaining US headquarters in the city), Harbison Walker Refactories as an independent until 1967 (while still maintaining US headquarters in the city) and the still operational Allegheny Technologies and Ampco Pittsburgh. Bethlehem Steel, Republic Steel and LTV Steel also had large local operations. Other major mills of the area included: McKeesport Tube Works 1872–1987[14][15] Edgar Thomson Steel Works 1873–present Hays Army Ammunition Plant 1942-June 1971 Clairton Steel Works April 21, 1903[16]-1984[17] Duquesne Steel Works 1886 – October 1, 1984, employed as many as 9,000 persons in the 1940s.[18][19] Homestead Steel Works 1881-May 24, 1986[20][21] Carrie Furnace 1884–1982 Saxonburg Mill -1987[15] Verona Mill April 4, 1905- (two 20-gross-ton Symthe acid open hearth furnaces) (14,400 tons annually) Mon Valley Works – Irvin Plant 1938–present Midland Cyclops Steel Plant until October 15, 1982[22] McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania Wheel and Axel plant (Lockhart Iron and Steel and Pressed Steel Car Corp.) Pressed Steel had as many as 12,000 employees.[23] Donora US Steel Wire mill -1966 4,500 employees[24][25][26] Monessen American Chain & Cable -1972 1,000 employees.[24] East Monongahela Liggett Spring & Axle -1978 350 employees.[24] McKeesport Ft. Pitt Steel Casting -1978 325 employees.[24] Hazelwood J&L Steel -1981 1,000 employees.[24] Glassport Bucyrus-Erie -1981 430 employees.[24] West Homestead Mesta Machinery -1981 300 employees.[24] West Mifflin Continental Can -1982 265 employees.[24] Alcoa's New Kensington works 1893-March 1971 at its peak employed 3,300 workers on 75 acres under 1 million square feet of manufacturing space.[27] Alcoa's Logan Ferry Powder Works 1918–? Alcoa's Coal Mine (north of New Kensington) 1918–1923[27] Carnegie's Union Railroad was founded in 1894 and is still in operation serving area steel mills. Twentieth century[edit] Pittsburgh Steel mill in Homestead circa 1907 In the early 20th century the economy of Pittsburgh was primarily driven by the steel industry and the city had reached a population 321,616.[28] Throughout this period, Pittsburgh would see a spike in population and a slow decline at the end of the century. At one point Pittsburgh was the eighth-largest city in America.[citation needed] In 1901, The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers organized a general strike against the U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries, the first strike since 1892.[29] A 1903 Pittsburgh Press front page highlighted the city's being a focus point for three different railroads.[30] In 1911 the city was being referred to as the \"Stogie capital of the nation\" with several high quality cigar manufacturers located in the region.[31] Pittsburgh produced around one third of the national output of steel by the 1920s. During this period Pittsburgh was home to the world's largest tube and pipe mill, structural steel plant, rail mill, wire manufacturing plant, bridge and construction fabricating plant.[32] \"Boat building and metal industries were later the economic base of the region. When coke from coal began to replace charcoal from wood in iron and steel making Pittsburgh grew up as the heart of the industry. A plentiful supply of bituminous coal underlies the Pittsburgh area.\"[33] Around forty percent of the nation's coal was obtained from within 100 miles of Pittsburgh.[32] Due to the reforms of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, steel unions gained success in Pittsburgh. The Wagner Act of 1935 gave employees rights to self-organize in labor unions and made it unlawful for employers to prevent or interfere with such unions.[34] By the 1950s industrial leaders worked with regional government leaders to foster and retain more local industry; organizations such as the RIDC were formed to further this goal.[35][36] However, in the early to mid-1980s the steel industry collapsed, leaving half of the nation's steelworkers unemployed.[37] \"The number of steel workers in the Pittsburgh area dropped from 90,000 in 1980 to 44,000 in just four years\".[38] Motor Coils manufacturing company of suburban Forest Hills and Braddock has been a leading supplier to American railroads since 1957.[39] Pittsburgh was a major center for advertising and public relations firms in the 20th century such as Ketchum and Burson-Marsteller.[40] Retail chains such as G. C. Murphy, Thrift Drug, Thorofare, Fisher's Big Wheel and Giant Eagle were founded in the early part of the 20th century with Phar-Mor dominating local retail from the 1980s to the 2000s. Thorofare ceased operations in 1982 and Thrift Drug was bought out by Eckerd in 1996. Local stores of Loblaws closed in 1958, Kroger in 1966 (although it retains stores in nearby West Virginia counties) and A&P in 1972.[41] IGA closed its area stores in the early 2000s.[42] Transition into the present economy[edit] Within the transitional years between 1970 and 1990, Pittsburgh's Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area saw shifts in its main employers, which were the manufacturing sector. In 1970, one out of every three jobs was in the manufacturing sector. By 1980 this had slipped to one in four. In 1980, the average production worker in manufacturing was making $360.89 weekly, which was almost $70 more than the state and national average. During this period the largest group of occupational employment was blue collar. This group in 1980 accounted for almost 68 percent of the jobs market. In the 1980s, a decline in the manufacturing industry was expected. The accepted trend was that Pittsburgh would embrace “industrial robots”. Since 1955 Pittsburgh has seen a steady decline in manufacturing employment. In 1955 Pittsburgh had a population of 41.8 percent in the manufactory business. In 1980 that number had slipped to almost 25.3 percent.[43] Allegheny County is the center for health care and higher education employment. Higher education and health care were the biggest creators of high-wage[clarification needed] jobs in the Pittsburgh region between 1999 and 2005. Education accounts for almost 80% of high-wage jobs in Allegheny County. The Pittsburgh area has seen growth in other sectors as well. Professional services, finance and wholesale trade were among the growing sectors. However, much of this growth was outside the borders of Allegheny County. This was detrimental to the county of Allegheny; however, the growth in the outer nine counties helped to stabilize the loss of employment. With big events happening in Pittsburgh throughout the late 2000s, the tourism industry has flourished. The industry has created over 11,000 new jobs in the area, some 6,000 of them within Allegheny County.[44] Pittsburgh has long been a major finance and banking center.[45] Present situation[edit] Since 2009 Pittsburgh has hosted the annual DUG East Conference.[46][47] \"Total nonfarm employment, over-the-year percent change in the United States and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, March 1999-2009\"[48] The following is a list of the top ten private employers in Pittsburgh.[49] Rank Employer Number of Pittsburgh employees Product(s) 1 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 40,600 Health care 2 University of Pittsburgh 12,600 Higher education 3 PNC Financial Services 9,200 Financial services 4 Allegheny Health Network 8,900 Health care 5 Giant Eagle 8,000 Supermarkets 6 Bank of New York Mellon 7,610 Financial services 7 Highmark 5,270 Health insurance 8 U.S. Steel 4,700 Steel manufacturing 9 Carnegie Mellon University 4,600 Higher education 10 Verizon Communications 3,750 Telecommunications Pittsburgh saw fewer effects of the 2008 economic recession than many other American cities. The city's transition from heavy dependence on the manufacturing industries to an economy based on health services, education, and innovative technologies kept Pittsburgh from the worst of the recession. The housing industry never saw the over-inflation rates other regions were dealing with as housing prices rose two percent in the last quarter of 2008, while other cities in the nation saw a much higher decline percentage.[50] In the period between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh MSA experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation out of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States. 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values during the same period.[51] National non-profits[edit] Several national or global non-profits call Pittsburgh home including: Learning Disabilities Association of America (since 1963)[52] Institute for Research, Education and Training in Addictions[53] National Center for Juvenile Justice (since 1973)[54] Colcom Foundation (since 1996) Laurel Foundation (since 1951) Heinz Endowments Printing Industries of America (since 2003) Twenty-first-century progression[edit] The shifting economy of Pittsburgh has seen changes since the 1990s; these are primarily in banking, health care and technology. However, In December 2004, Pittsburgh was forced into an Act 47 because the finances in the city were down. In January 2003 Pittsburgh's unemployment rate reached 6.8%, but has seen a major decline in, as in April 2005 the rates were near only 4.8%.[55] Since one in every five jobs in Pittsburgh lies within the health care service, Pittsburgh was able to hold steady during the recent economic downturn.[56][57] During this, the city also began to see growth in other occupations such as the business service and construction. The business service sectors in 2008 saw an increase of over 3,000 jobs. During the downturn, Pittsburgh still developed many parts of the city creating over 1,000 construction jobs in the region.[58] Technology industry[edit] Pittsburgh has established itself as a technology hub with such companies as Google, Apple Inc., Intel, Uber, Facebook and RAND establishing campuses in the city. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Pittsburgh LAN Coalition also develop major innovations.[citation needed] Companies such as Duolingo, Petrosoft, Modcloth, Guru.com, Songwhale and others have global headquarters in the city. The Crons company designs motivational athletic apparel.[59] 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh Summit[edit] Main article: 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit Pittsburgh was chosen to hold the 2009 G-20 summit for multiple reasons. Pittsburgh utilizes its past by building on previous successes in manufacturing, business services, and green energy. \"Pittsburgh manufacturers employ almost 100,000 workers and the region is the second-largest market in the United States for metals industry employment.\"[60] Pittsburgh is also home to some of the world's largest business and financial services, which supply the greatest amount to the regional economic output. In the past, innovation in energy has been advanced through commercialization of oil, coal, and natural gas. More focus and attention is being given to the innovation in sustainability and efficiency while protecting the environment as Pittsburgh has more than 30 LEED certified buildings.[60] Economic development plan[edit] The State of Pennsylvania requires every county to develop a land use and growth management plan. Allegheny Places is the plan for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. It was adopted in November 2008 and is a “unique blueprint for a sustainable future envisioned by the citizens of the County”.[61] The plan has a steering committee with over 100 members, an advisory committee with over 400 members, and a sounding board. The plan advocates a future in which: Equitable access to the opportunities and benefits of economic development to all residents is provided Former brownfields are transformed and developed Transit-oriented development efforts reduce road congestion and connect the major economic areas – Oakland, Downtown, and the Pittsburgh International Airport The promotion of greenways will link the community with parks, trails, riverfronts, etc. Affordable[clarification needed] and high-quality[clarification needed] housing exists for all A diversified economy provides stable, well-paying jobs[62] The economic development plan includes enterprise zones, research and technology developments, development of research parks, such as the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center, partnerships with economic development organizations, and venture capital initiatives. An Urban Enterprise Zone is a location within the inner city free from import duties, taxes, and some government regulations.[63] Studies of enterprise zones have shown increased job growth and investment. In the majority of studies, there is an apparent relationship between the creation of enterprise zones and increased economic activity in the zones. The zones also show economic activity not typical of the surrounding metropolitan area.[64] However, success is often questionable and subject to local conditions.[65] Allegheny County has 26 enterprise zones, in which 17 are in the City of Pittsburgh.[62] The research and technology sector is growing due to the local universities, medical centers, the technology cluster, and the provision of financial capital to fund its development. These attributes provide the specific infrastructure required of sought-after industries.[62] Therefore, this could attract business to the region and sustain or expand existing firms, which should result in a net increase in total jobs. However, this type of development is still fairly new, which means it is difficult to draw any noteworthy conclusions about its potential. Also, the presence of universities provides the context for university-industry technology transfers, which is the effective movement of technology to industry via students trained in detailed programs to meet the detailed wants of the industry.[66] Economic upward mobility[edit] According to a 2014 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Pittsburgh is the second-best American city for intergenerational economic mobility;[67] in other words, Pittsburgh is the second best city to achieve the American Dream.[68] 2013 news[edit] As of early 2013 the largest property managers in the Pittsburgh area included CBRE Group,[69] Oxford Development,[70] RIDC[71] and Jones Lang Lasalle.[72] On August 13, 2013, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the H. J. Heinz Company would lay off 350 office employees who work in the Pittsburgh area. After the layoff, the company will still have approximately 800 employees in the Pittsburgh area.[73] 2014 news[edit] Work is underway for an innovation roadmap for the city.[74] References[edit] ^ This article incorporates public domain material from Barack Obama.

October 23, 1907, it closed for three months due to the 1907 recession.[3] During World War I the market closed for four months starting on July 31, 1914, due to economic effects of the war.[3] With the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange closing that day,[3] on March 5, 1933 President Roosevelt announced a bank holiday[3] as both Mellon Financial and PNC Bank with the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange all left nervous account holders waiting outside locked doors.[citation needed] Final years[edit] On April 5, 1966 the New York Stock Exchange responded to the Regional Industrial Development Corporation's invitation to relocate to Pittsburgh, with the NYSE promising that the city was under consideration.[6] On December 24, 1969, The Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange bought the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange with the commitment to keep the trading floor operational in the city, yet a national economic downturn and increased computerization and centralization led to the Exchange closing after trading ended at 3 PM on August 23, 1974.[4] At its height the exchange traded over 1,200 companies but by the last trading day in 1974 only Pittsburgh Brewing Company, Williams & Company and Westinghouse remained listed. A total of 11 companies traded the last day with 3,100 shares.[5] The stock exchange closed its Fourth Avenue \"financial district\" doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York, Chicago, and other global centers.[6] Some academics posit the exchange closed due to an extended national bear market and increased computerization that would eventually centralize much regional stock market trading to New York City.[1] Locations[edit] Pre-1903 location on Fourth Avenue From April 1, 1903 until October 1962 the stock exchange was located at 229 Fourth Avenue.[7] From October 1962 until it closed in August 1974 it was located at the two-story 8,500 square foot structure at 333 Fourth Avenue. Prior to 1903 it was located in rented quarters of the Pittsburgh Bank for Savings on the corner of Fourth Avenue and Smithfield Street.[citation needed] After the exchange closed,[4] the 1962–1974 structure was purchased by Point Park University on November 1, 2006 for $645,000.[8] Executives[edit] John Baxter Barbour, Jr. (April 16, 1862–March 11, 1929) was president of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange for eight terms.[9][10] Barbour was elected to membership in the Oil Exchange when he was nineteen years of age, and of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, was one of the organizers and a charter member. He became president in 1911. On May 3, 1916, he was again elected president. For two terms he was treasurer of the Pittsburgh Petroleum, Stock and Metal Exchange.[11] On June 7, 1936 Pittsburgh Stock Exchange secretary Paul Leitch died suddenly at 36 from a heart attack.[12] See also[edit] Business and economics portal List of former stock exchanges in the Americas List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas List of stock exchanges Economy of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh in the American Civil War Fourth Avenue Historic District Etymology of Pittsburgh References[edit] ^ a b c Gigler, Rich (August 24, 1974). \"The City Stock Exchange Closes as a Victim of the Times\".

        "content": "Culture of Pittsburgh - Wikipedia Jump to content Search Search Culture of Pittsburgh Add languages Add links From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The culture of Pittsburgh stems from the city's long history as a center for cultural philanthropy, as well as its rich ethnic traditions. In the 19th and 20th centuries, wealthy businessmen such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry J. Heinz, Henry Clay Frick, and nonprofit organizations such as the Carnegie Foundation donated millions of dollars to create educational and cultural institutions. Architecture[edit] Cathedral of Learning, Pittsburgh, May 14, 2005. The Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece Fallingwater is about an hour's drive from Downtown Pittsburgh. The North Shore has an 1895 neogothic church, Calvary Methodist, with an interior designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. The church's stained glass windows are some of the largest and most elaborate work Tiffany ever created. The Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh, an opulently decorated edifice with elaborate Old World flourishes is one of the finest examples of the so-called Polish Cathedral style,[1] dominating the skyline over Polish Hill. The Allegheny County Courthouse (1886), designed by H.H. Richardson, is a unique and influential building. At 42 stories, the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning (1937) is the second tallest collegiate building in the world. The tallest skyscraper in Pittsburgh is the triangular U.S. Steel Tower. Both Acrisure Stadium (2001) and PNC Park (2001) are designed to give fans a view of the city skyline. Conventions[edit] David L. Lawrence Convention Center, as viewed from I-579 bridge. The David L. Lawrence Convention Center, located on the south bank of the Allegheny River, is able to accommodate all sizes of conventions, exhibitions and conferences. Certified with a Gold rating by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design initiative, the building is considered the first ever \"green\" convention center and world's largest \"green\" building.

The PFO has assisted more than 102 feature films and television productions to southwestern Pennsylvania to generate an economic impact of more than $575 million for the region.[2] Pittsburgh Filmmakers teaches media arts and runs three \"arthouse\" movie theaters and since 1981 the Three Rivers Film Festival has brought national attention to local talent and artists of the region.

August Wilson, one of the best known playwrights of his generation, was a Pittsburgh native. The majority of his plays are set in the city as well including the two he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for (Fences (play) and The Piano Lesson). Friday Nite Improvs, an improv show at the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, is Pittsburgh's longest-running theatre show. It has produced a number of professional writers and actors.

And the Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh hosts early music concerts of artists from across the country. Jazz[edit] Pittsburgh became an important gateway between the north, south, east and west of the U.S., playing a strong role in the development of jazz. Jazz came to the city's African American neighborhoods after 1925. The Hill District became known as \"Little Harlem\" from the 1920s until the early 1950s. There were hundreds of jazz venues in the community, which later helped to promote the emergence of bebop, the most famous was probably the Crawford Grill which nightly attracted top national talent.[7] A number of influential musicians emerged from the city. Mary Lou Williams, Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Billy Strayhorn, who was Duke Ellington's primary musical collaborator for 28 years, came from the city's East End regions of Homewood and East Liberty. A number of musicians came from communities outside the city, including: Maxine Sullivan (Homestead), Sonny Clark (Herminie) and Earl \"Fatha\" Hines (Duquesne). Vocalist and bandleader Billy Eckstine was one of the first musicians to be paid a $1 million recording contract.[7] Trumpeter Roy Eldridge, drummer Kenneth Spearman \"Klook\" Clarke, and influential bassist Ray Brown were born in the city; singer Lena Horne was raised in Pittsburgh. Bassist Paul Chambers, also born in Pittsburgh, played on two of the most important albums in jazz history: Miles Davis' Kind of Blue (1959) and John Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960).[7] Other noted jazz musicians include: Eric Kloss, Dodo Marmarosa, Walt Harper, Tommy and Stanley Turrentine, Horace Parlan, pianist, Nathan Davis, guitarist George Benson, and drummers Art Blakey, Roger Humphries and Jeff \"Tain\" Watts. A young Lena Horne also spent her formative years learning jazz and blues in the city's Hill District. Popular music[edit] Pittsburgh's role in popular music began with native Stephen Foster and his enduring classics of the 1800s. So influential was Foster's works that he has been called the \"Father of American music\", has had five films made of his life, has heavily influenced such talents as Nellie Bly and Jackie Gleason and has had two of his songs chosen as state anthems (Kentucky and Florida) as well as the annual selections of Churchill Downs. Pittsburgh is perhaps most associated for the plethora of Doo Wop artists that were produced during the 1950s and 1960s, thanks in part to local legendary disc jockey Porky Chedwick playing songs that in most other major markets wouldn't risk being played. Several groups such as the Del-Vikings, The Marcels, The Vogues and The Skyliners exemplify the regions doo-wop contributions. During this same era notable solo acts such as Henry Mancini, Perry Como and Bobby Vinton came out of the region to reach world fame in the industry. A years long engagement at the city's William Penn Hotel also launched the national career of Lawrence Welk. During the 1970s and 1980s rock era Pittsburgh had a major role in the success of both Wild Cherry and their most popular song/album Play That Funky Music (inspired by a fan's plea to them during a performance at the North Side's 2001 Club in 1976), and being the home to Bret Michaels, known for his fame in the band Poison. Both Joe Grushecky and Donnie Iris achieved one-hit wonder fame and lasting regional rock fame. Several notable bands emerged from Pittsburgh in the 1990s, including Rusted Root, The Clarks, Don Caballero, and the punk rock bands Anti-Flag and Aus-Rotten. Rusted Root and The Clarks appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. Formed in 1999, the garage rock group Modey Lemon toured the U.S. and internationally, gaining favorable reviews. Singer Christina Aguilera, a student at North Allegheny Intermediate High School, debuted locally at the 1999 Lilith Fair, before going on to sell over 43 million albums worldwide.[8] In the 2000s, Anti-Flag produced five albums, signed to RCA Records and appeared several times on the Vans Warped Tour. Rapper Wiz Khalifa, who signed to Warner Bros. Records but left without releasing an album, topped the iTunes singles chart by the end of the decade. Mashup/laptop music artist Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis) found mainstream success. His 2006 album Night Ripper gained favorable reviews and Feed the Animals (2008) topped year end album lists in national media.[8] Since 2010, solo acts such as natives Jackie Evancho, Slimmie Hendrix, Wiz Khalifa, Daya, and Mac Miller have achieved worldwide fame. Josh Groban was trained in Pittsburgh, having attended Carnegie Mellon University. While it has historically been low-key, Pittsburgh's Hardcore/Metal scene has also gained international attention since the early 2010s, as witnessed by the critical success of the band Code Orange. Other extreme bands from Pittsburgh include Signs Of The Swarm and Those Who Fear. In the late 2010s and 2020s, many Pittsburgh-based bands involved in the city’s local music scene rose to nationwide prominence, including Feeble Little Horse, Short Fictions, and Merce Lemon. This period of time has been marked by an uptick in shoegaze, noise rock, emo, and slowcore music coming from within the local scene, as well.[9] Dance[edit] Pittsburgh Dance Council and the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater host a variety of dance events. Polka, folk, square and round dancing have a long history in the city and are celebrated by the internationally famous Duquesne University Tamburitzans, a multicultural academy dedicated to the preservation and presentation of folk songs and dance. Museums and art[edit] Tyrannosaurus rex skull, Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Pittsburgh has several visual arts museums, including the Andy Warhol Museum, dedicated to the works of Pittsburgh native Andy Warhol. The Carnegie Museum of Art is home to works by artists including Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Robert Adam, along with galleries of sculpture, modern art, the Heinz Architectural Center, a large film and video collection, and various traveling exhibits. Installation art is featured outdoors at ArtGardens of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts shows contemporary art and provides resources for Western Pennsylvania artists. The town's history museum is the Heinz History Center with an annual attendance of 130,000. The Carnegie Museum of Natural History, located in Oakland, has extensive dinosaur collections on display, including the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever discovered, and an Egyptian wing. The building may be distinguished by a life-size statue known as, \"Dippy the Diplodocus\" to the right of the main entrance. Other dinosaur statues are visible around the Pittsburgh area, these were decorated by artists nationwide and sold as a benefit to the Carnegie Museums. The Carnegie Science Center, located in the North Side near PNC Park and Heinz Field, is more technology oriented. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, located on Pittsburgh's Northside, has a variety of interactive exhibits and programs for children and families including a multimedia art studio, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, water area and theater for performances. Recreation[edit] See also: Sports in Pittsburgh Close by the Phipp's Conservatory is the Schenley Park Golf Course, a public golf links. Kennywood Park is widely regarded by rollercoaster enthusiasts to have some of the best rollercoasters in the world, including several early 20th century wooden coasters: the Racer, the Thunderbolt, and the Jackrabbit. A water park owned by Kennywood, Sandcastle, is another local amusement park. Counter-culture[edit] Pittsburgh has recently gained attention as a burgeoning center for counter-culture, as well as punk music.[10] The annual Pennsic War, the Society for Creative Anachronism's largest re-enactment of pre-17th-century Europe, is hosted nearby. Anthrocon, one the world's largest furry conventions, returns every summer to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The Pittsburgh Cacophony Society is also very active,[11] and in 2008, the Pittsburgh Burning Man community launched a winter regional burn event called Frostburn.

It is typically a tradition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,[2] and Youngstown, Ohio.[3] Cookie tables are included in primarily Italian, Polish or Catholic wedding receptions. Other groups that also have cookie tables or cookie platters are the Greeks, Slovaks, Serbian Orthodox, Austrian/Hungarian, and Scandinavians. The inclusion of a cookie table is more widely known where those of Italian ancestry settled, and also in some cases, of the other groups mentioned above. Where a settlement did not consist of sizable numbers of Italian or Eastern European groups, the number of those who were familiar with cookie tables decreased. Cookie tables were better known in the east than in the mid-west, south, southwest or west.[4] Research by the Arms Family Museum of Local History in Youngstown discovered the dominant areas for cookie tables were northeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, including New Castle, Pennsylvania. Cookie tables were also well known in West Virginia, Virginia, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. States where they were unknown or not present included Washington, California, Texas and Nevada.[1] The world record for the largest cookie table was set on August 11, 2019 in Monongahela, Pennsylvania with 88,425 cookies.[5] References[edit] ^ a b Martinson, Suzanne (August 15, 2004). \"Youngstown lays claim to the cookie table\".

This club was frequently mentioned by travelers commenting on the early culture of Pittsburgh,[7] however it was disbanded by university faculty in 1833 because, according to Agnes Starrett's 1937 history of the university, \"instead of Shakespeare, the members had begun to produce vulgar modern comedies\".[7] Throughout the 1800s, Pittsburgh was home to various stock companies, beginning with the Theater on Third Street, Pittsburgh's first free-standing playhouse, in 1813.[8] These companies were composed of eight to ten local actors, a stage manager and prompter, a stage carpenter, a properties master, and occasionally an orchestra leader; the local actors would perform with touring \"stars\" such as William Macready, Edwin Forrest, Junius and Edwin Booth, Charles Kean, Charlotte Cushman, James Hackett, and Edwin Adams.[9] An important milestone in the creation of indigenous Pittsburgh theater occurred when William Henderson took over the lease of the Old Drury in 1859 and produced plays by Pittsburgh playwrights in the theater's season. Other theaters followed Henderson's lead, including the Pittsburgh Opera House, which held the first productions of nationally regarded playwright Bartley Campbell.[10] In the early 1900s, Pittsburgh became a key location for productions handled by the Theatrical Syndicate due to its strategic location, abundance of playhouses, excellent rail service, and established audiences. Sam Nixon and Fred Zimmerman's building of the Nixon and the Gayety (now Byham Theater) attracted touring productions of successful Broadway plays as well as international ballet and opera companies. Harry Davis, another theatrical entrepreneur in the early 1900s, founded the Family Avenue Theater and the Pittsburgh Opera House, which produced melodramas and standard plays as well as showed films. In the early 1910s, concern over the lack of serious or \"legitimate\" theater in Pittsburgh led to an \"art theater movement\" that involved the establishment of the Pitt Theatre Company of Pittsburgh in 1913, the Drama League of Pittsburgh in 1912, and 1914, the establishment of the nation's first bachelor of arts degree in theater at Carnegie Tech.[11] In the 1920s, vaudeville became very popular in Pittsburgh, and the Little Theater Movement was represented by many independent, noncommercial theater companies such as People's Playhouse of the North Side, the Suburban Theater of the South Hills, the Tarkington Theater, the Pitt Players, and the Duquesne University Red Masquers. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, noncommercial theater became more culturally important and political in nature, exemplified by the New Theater of Pittsburgh, organized in 1935. Black theater also became a more important cultural force at this time, most notably with the Olympian Players. The Negro Drama League was formed in 1932 to support the vibrant theatrical activity of African-Americans in Pittsburgh. Jewish theatrical activity also became more prominent in Pittsburgh at this time, notably with the Irene Kaufmann Settlement Players. German and Catholic theater developed a presence as well. Civic theaters devoted to a sense of civic theatrical identity grew in popularity; the still-active Pittsburgh Playhouse, established in 1934, is the most enduring theater of this movement.[12] Theaters[edit] Byham Theater Of the theater companies in Pittsburgh currently in existence, there are a few with a long history of performances. Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was one such company; staging primarily musicals, it held its first production in 1946 at the Pitt Stadium. Over the years, the company has moved to various locations throughout the city and currently holds productions in the Benedum Center.[1] The Pittsburgh Savoyards, which specializes in Gilbert and Sullivan (G&S) operettas, came into existence in 1938, and is currently housed in Bellevue and performing in the Andrew Carnegie Free Library & Music Hall. University of Pittsburgh Stages emerged from various performance troupes at the school in the early 20th century to become the formal company of the school's theater arts performance training program of the university in the 1960s. The university company became professionally oriented in 1981,[13] and continues to stage several productions throughout the year in their primary facility, the historic Stephen Foster Memorial. Saint Vincent Summer Theatre, another major fixture of the Pittsburgh area, began in Latrobe in 1969.[14] The theater has staged many different kinds of productions over the years, and now produces mostly light farces for a summer theater audience.[15] Mountain Playhouse, one of the oldest professional theaters in the Pittsburgh area, made its debut in nearby Jennerstown in 1939.[16] Similar to St. Vincent, Mountain Playhouse also stages light summer stock fare, including comedies and musicals.[17] Apple Hill Playhouse in nearby Delmont also stages light comedies and musicals as well as children's theater; it was established in the 1950s.[18] Pittsburgh Playhouse, currently home to Point Park University's conservatory students and resident professional theater company Playhouse Rep, opened its doors in 1934 as a community theater.[19] Stage Right was established in the mid-1960s and continues to produce theater in the Fox Chapel area of Pittsburgh.[20] Other important theater companies of the mid-twentieth century include Black Horizon Theater, an African-American theater troupe that evolved out of a writers' workshop; and peer support group called the Centre Avenue Poets' Theater Workshop; this theater company held some of the first productions of August Wilson's work.[21] Pittsburgh Public Theater was chartered in 1974 by Joan Apt, Margaret Rieck and Ben Shaktman and held its first production in 1975. Staging a wide variety of plays and musicals, from classical to contemporary, the theatre has become a major regional theatre and is currently housed in the O'Reilly Theater.[22] City Theatre also staged its first production in 1975 as the City Players, a group of recent college graduates that gave free performances in schools, parks, and housing projects. The company has since evolved to become a major regional theatre that has staged premieres of new works by Christopher Durang, Adam Rapp, Jeffrey Hatcher, Eric Simonson, and Leslie Ayvazian.[23][24] In 1980, Attilio Favorini founded the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival, a professional theatre company in residence at the University of Pittsburgh which produced Shakespeare at the Stephen Foster Memorial and was successful for many years.[25] O'Reilly Theater In the 1990s and early 2000s, a new generation of theatre companies emerged. Quantum Theatre was founded in 1990 by Karla Boos; it has staged productions of plays, musicals, and operas from world culture in nontraditional spaces around the Pittsburgh area.[26] The Pittsburgh New Works Festival was established in 1990 as well to provide a venue for new plays by playwrights from all over the country.[27] Pittsburgh Musical Theater opened in 1990 as another venue for musical theater in the city.[28] The performance art troupe Squonk Opera was formed in Pittsburgh in 1992 and has gone on to perform in venues across the globe in addition to performing in local venues.[29] Unseam'd Shakespeare Company was established in 1993 and has staged classical and classically inspired plays.[30] The Summer Company was also established in 1993 as a venue for summer productions of contemporary and classical plays.[31] Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre was founded in 1996 and has also staged plays from European and classical playwrights.[32] Prime Stage Theatre was also founded in 1996 and is focused on the educational aspect of theatre.[33] In 1999, Stage Right! was formed in Greensburg as another venue for professional musical theatre in the region as well as to train young people in the skills of musical theatre.[34] Jewish Theatre of Pittsburgh was formed in 2001, producing theatre from a Jewish perspective.[35] Cup-A-Jo Productions was founded in 2004 with a mission of combining productions of new and established works with other media such as film, dance, and poetry.[citation needed] Future Ten emerged in 2003 as another venue for new plays, showcasing the ten-minute play format.[36] Hiawatha Project, 12 Peers Theater, Caravan Theatre of Pittsburgh, Throughline Theatre Company, Three Rivers Theatre Company, Organic Theater Pittsburgh, Phase 3 Productions, Theatre Sans Serif, Carrnivale Theatrics, and Bald Theatre Company were all established in the late 2000s and early 2010s and have continued the expansion of Pittsburgh's thriving theatre community.[37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Modern Companies include Attack Theatre, Bald Theatre Company, barebones productions, Bricolage Production Company, City Theatre, Jewish Theatre of Pittsburgh, Phase 3 Productions, Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre, Pittsburgh Musical Theater, Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company, Pittsburgh Public Theater, Prime Stage Theatre, Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, Quantum Theatre, Hiawatha Project, Cup-A-Jo Productions, Heritage Players, Organic Theater Pittsburgh, 12 Peers Theater, The Pittsburgh Savoyards, Three Rivers Theatre Company, Throughline Theatre Company, Comtra Theater, No Name Players, Terra Nova Theatre Group, Caravan Theatre of Pittsburgh, Carrnivale Theatrics, Theatre Sans Serif, The Summer Company, Stage Right, Unseam'd Shakespeare Company, Front Porch Theatricals and Saltworks Theatre Company.

Robinson was so severely injured in a childhood electrical accident that he could not go out in public without fear of causing a panic, so he went for long walks at night. Local tourists would drive along his road in hopes of meeting the Green Man or Charlie No-Face. Most became disappointed to see no such person. Nonetheless, people passed on tales about him to their children and grandchildren. People raised on these tales are sometimes surprised to discover that he was a real person who was loved by his family and neighbors.[2] Injury[edit] Raymond Robinson was eight years old when he was injured by an electrical line as he climbed a pole and reached for a bird's nest on the Morado Bridge, outside of Beaver Falls. The bridge carried a trolley and had electrical lines of both 1,200 and 22,000 volts, which were responsible for the death of another boy less than a year earlier. Robinson survived, defying doctors' expectations, but he was severely disfigured; he lost his eyes, nose, and right arm.[2][3][4] Adult life[edit] Robinson lived in Koppel, Pennsylvania, and spent his days at home with relatives, making doormats, wallets, and belts to sell.[5] Because of his appearance, he rarely ventured out during the day. However, at night, he went for long walks on a quiet stretch of State Route 351, feeling his way along with a walking stick. Groups of locals regularly gathered to search for him walking along the road. Robinson usually hid from his curious neighbors but would sometimes exchange a short conversation or a photograph for beer or cigarettes. Some were friendly, others cruel, but none of his encounters deterred Robinson from his nightly walks. He was struck by cars more than once.[2][6][7] He stopped his walks during the last years of his life and retired to the Beaver County Geriatric Center, where he died in 1985 at the age of 74.[2] Legacy[edit] Robinson became a local myth in the Pittsburgh area, and his real story was obscured by urban legend. In the stories, he is the \"Green Man\", and as a boy, he climbed an electric pole to see into a bird's nest, and was shocked. He fell to the ground, and lost his eyes, nose, mouth, one ear, and one arm. The story states that when he grew older, he hid in an abandoned house. The famed nickname of \"Green Man\" came from his skin, which was purported to be green because of the electrical shock he suffered in the stories. Through several generations, Robinson's story has been passed on so many times that his name and his real history have been overshadowed by the ghost story that grew out of them.[8][9] Filmmaker Tisha York planned to direct and publish a film based on the Green Man urban legend, titled Route 351, in 2008, intending to complete it in 2009. Shooting was delayed by the Great Recession and is on hold as of 2025[update]. York holds the film rights to the story, though a complete documentary was never made.[10] References[edit] ^ \"Birth certificate of Raymond Robinson\". Find a Grave. October 29, 1910.

For the car part, see Spare tire. Two patio chairs reserving a shoveled-out street parking space in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood A chair and a small table marking a parking space as informally reserved in Chicago A parking chair is a chair that is used by a motorist to informally mark a public parking space as reserved. Other objects are also used for this purpose, including trash cans, ladders, ironing boards, traffic cones, and similar-sized objects. In Boston, these are known as parking space savers or just space savers.[1] For curbside parking spaces, two or more items are normally used; for angle spaces, only one is needed.[2] The practice of using parking chairs is common in snowy weather within urban residential areas of the United States, where vehicle owners do not wish to risk losing their vehicle's previously occupied space in its absence. Other spaces may be hard to find due to accumulation of uncleared and plowed snow, and the owner of a vehicle may have invested considerable work in clearing a parking space to free the car. This is common in areas where side streets are fully lined with parallel parked cars allowing only the center of the street to be cleared of snow, which then has the effect of pushing the snow onto the parked cars. The practice is widely criticized because it reduces the amount of parking, and is considered unneighborly and selfish. This practice is especially common in the Northeastern United States (for example, in Boston[3] and Pittsburgh[4]), as well as Philadelphia, and the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions (for example, in Chicago, where it is referred to as \"dibs\"[5][6][7][8]). In Pittsburgh and Chicago, the use of parking chairs is considered to be an \"iconic\" regional practice.[9][5] Use in inclement weather[edit] In snowstorms, vehicle owners with such a need mark the space as their own that their vehicle previously occupied after digging out the heavy snow that covered the vehicle and blocked them in. A such way to indicate that the parking spot is reserved is to place a lawn chair often referred as a \"Parking Chair\" to indicate others of the reserved spot for the owner that will soon return.[10] The legality and level of enforcement of existing laws pertaining to this practice varies by location. Generally, curbside parking spaces are public property and are available to vehicles on a first-come, first-served basis. Still, respecting these makeshift markers has been accepted by citizens as a common courtesy during snowstorms.[11] Parking chair placed prior to a snowstorm While use is year-round, it is a particularly time-honored tradition in heavy snowfall accumulation, when a resident who \"digs out\" their spot on the street essentially declares ownership, which often goes unchallenged by neighbors for fear of retribution.[12][13] The idea of the practice is that the person reserves the space from which they have freed their vehicle for future parking during the remainder of the storm and as long as snow remains on the ground.[14] It is generally a Lockean recognition that the effort of the physical exertion of digging provides an entitlement to the space where the vehicle was previously located.[15] But in some instances, spaces get reserved in this fashion even before a snowstorm starts.[16][17] Origin[edit] The practice is common throughout areas of the United States susceptible to large amounts of snow and where curbside parking on residential streets is the norm, especially in the Northeast.[18] The items used have sometimes been referred to as the Pittsburgh Parking Chair, due to their common use in Pittsburgh and its nearby suburbs.[19] Pittsburgh is a very hilly area, with houses very close together, and many older neighborhoods predate cars, having narrow streets with no driveways to park in and parking on only one side of the street. While such ad hoc parking restrictions have no legal standing in the city of Pittsburgh, common and long standing community tradition supports their use. As the \"parking chair\" is part of the culture of the city, local police generally turn a blind eye to these impromptu markers, which under legal jurisdiction, technically qualify as \"abandoned furniture\".[20][21] Photographic evidence of the tradition has been found dating back at least to the 1950s. It is believed that the practice existed earlier, as the number of vehicles on residential streets has exceeded the number of available spaces.[19] The origin of this practice may be outside the United States, as it is also a common practice in southern Italy. Legality[edit] The practice has been outlawed in some places, including the city of Washington, D.C., where enforcement is strict and violators are ticketed.[22] Some places specifically prohibit the practice, with levels of enforcement that vary. Sanctions against violators may include fines and confiscation of the markers. Other places either do not enforce or make legal allowances for this activity. In Baltimore, after the 2010 blizzards on February 5–6 and February 9–10, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that the city would not enforce an existing ban on the practice. She said that it could not be stopped, saying that it was a local tradition and that it would be \"like telling people they can't say 'Hon'\".[23] Some places, including Pittsburgh, do not place legal sanctions against those engaging in the practice, but make clear that anyone has the right to claim an informal space that was reserved by someone else for their own vehicle, regardless of courtesy. However, it is a general practice around the city to respect the markers of others.[24] In 1994, Police in Dormont, a suburb of Pittsburgh, confiscated the markers from 200 spaces due to excessive complaints.[13] Pittsburgh retailers sell novelty \"Official Parking Chairs\".[9] In Boston, the law prohibits residents from saving the spaces they clear for longer than 48 hours from the moment a snow emergency is declared to be over.[25] However, they are outright banned in certain neighborhoods of the city, such as the South End.[26] In Aldan, Pennsylvania, the police chief confiscated all markers that were placed following the blizzards of 2010. He stated that he was enforcing a local ordinance in doing so.[27] In Chicago, the \"dibs\" practice is illegal under §10-28-070.[28] Though dibs incidents are traditionally unenforced in Chicago, there are notable police report rates for vandalism incident involving saved parking spaces.[29][30][31][32] On March 2, 2021, the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) began removing \"Dibs\" objects along with household trash.[33] WBEZ, Chicago's local NPR station, created a sign for residents to post that cites the Chicago statute prohibiting dibs.[34] Criticism[edit] Most dense residential urban streets do not have enough parking spaces to accommodate the number of drivers who desire them. When residents use parking chairs to claim spaces, they reduce the parking available to other drivers, by removing the efficiency that first-come, first-served public parking normally provides.[35] Furthermore, guest and work vehicles are discouraged from using available spaces when needed out of fear of retribution. Many citizens cite that despite the existing law prohibiting space savers' use after 48 hours after a declared snow emergency, residents still use them without penalty.[citation needed] This means that public property is being illegally claimed by an individual for their own private use. Disorderly behavior and vandalism[edit] In Chicago, people who call \"dibs\" on a parking spot have been reported for vandalizing vehicles parked where they called \"dibs\".[30][31][32] The most common form of retaliation is slashed tires, followed by broken car windows, cars keyed or dented, and broken mirrors. Other forms of documented retaliation include broken windshields, spray painting the car, and severing the car's brake line.[36] An NPR investigation found that among 64 police reports for dibs-related vandalism after three big snowstorms, just one resulted in an arrest. [37] Victims often say a parking chair was not in the spot at the time they parked, or that they were unaware of Chicago's \"dibs\" practices.[30][38] Sometimes the vandalism takes place when the victim parked for just a few minutes. For example, one police report states, “Victim related that he parked his vehicle down the street from Acero Elementary to get his child into school. He moved some boxes that someone had put there after shoveling out a parking space. Victim stated that he had every intention of putting them back after dropping off his child. Unknown offender had spray painted the door handles and rear license plate.”[39] Even in cities where parking chairs are generally tolerated, such as Pittsburgh, local police make it clear that public street parking cannot legally be reserved. Citizens are explicitly discouraged from using objects to block parking spaces. Because parking chairs are considered abandoned furniture, they may be removed at any time.[40] It is common for municipalities to forcibly remove the offending objects from time to time.[citation needed] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Parking chairs.

It has taken place in Downtown Pittsburgh every summer since 2015 (excluding 2020),[1] originally on the Three Sisters bridges and along the Allegheny Riverfront, before relocating to the Boulevard of the Allies and PPG Place for its 2023 installment.[2][3] The festival showcases \"all things pickled,\" including pickle-flavored beer and cocktails, pickle ice cream, and other pickled foods such as dilly beans and kimchi.[2][4][5] It also features live music, children's activities, and an annual pickle juice drinking competition, the winner of which is crowned the \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\".[3] The festival's centerpiece is a 35-foot-long (11 m) Heinz pickle balloon.[6] Picklesburgh was voted the \"best specialty food festival in America\" in USA Today readers' polls in 2021, 2022, and 2023.[7] History[edit] The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on the Rachel Carson Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[2] Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-based Heinz (now Kraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history of pickling.[8][9] Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles \"speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as a melting pot for Eastern European ethnic communities\",[10] although numerous countries of Western culture with significant diasporas in the United States, like Germany and Poland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growing farm-to-table movement and the trend of urban homesteading.[8] At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years.[11] The 2017 festival was held at the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year.[12][13] Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018, which was further expanded to four days in 2024.[14][15] Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in August 2021 with additional safety precautions on the Andy Warhol Bridge.[16] In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass.[17] Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to prevent overcrowding.[18] Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, \"At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance.\"[19] In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of the Boulevard of the Allies between Stanwix Street and Smithfield Street, and along Market Street into PPG Place.[6] Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors.[20] Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due to heat exhaustion and other ailments.[21] Pickle juice drinking competition[edit] Contestants prepare for the pickle juice drinking competition at Picklesburgh 2022 Since its founding in 2015, every Picklesburgh festival has featured a pickle juice drinking competition as its headline event.[22] In the competition, contestants race to drink a quart-sized jar of pickle juice without regurgitating, spilling, or leaving any juice in the jar.[9][22] The winner is dubbed the \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\" and receives a belt and a $500 cash prize, as of 2023.[9][23] The 2023 champion and reigning \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\" is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba, who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds.[22] The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022, when Wisconsin-based TikTok content creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds.[24] References[edit] ^ Woody, Felicia (15 July 2022). \"Picklesburgh returns to Pittsburgh - CBS Pittsburgh\".

Western Pennsylvania English can be seen in orange. A sign using \"Dahntahn\" to mean \"Downtown\" in Downtown Pittsburgh Western Pennsylvania English, known more narrowly as Pittsburgh English or popularly as Pittsburghese, is a dialect of American English native primarily to the western half of Pennsylvania, centered on the city of Pittsburgh, but potentially appearing in some speakers as far north as Erie County, as far east as Harrisburg, as far south as Clarksburg, West Virginia, and as far west as Youngstown, Ohio.[1][2] Commonly associated with the working class of Pittsburgh, users of the dialect are colloquially known as \"Yinzers\". Overview[edit] Scots-Irish, Pennsylvania Dutch, Polish,[3] Ukrainian[4] and Croatian[5] immigrants to the area all provided certain loanwords to the dialect (see \"Vocabulary\" below). Many of the sounds and words found in the dialect are popularly thought to be unique to Pittsburgh, but that is a misconception since the dialect resides throughout the greater part of western Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas.[6][7] Central Pennsylvania, currently an intersection of several dialect regions, was identified in 1949 by Hans Kurath as a subregion between western and eastern Pennsylvania,[8][9] but some scholars in the 20th century onwards have identified it within the western Pennsylvania dialect region.[9][10] Since Kurath's study, one of western Pennsylvania's defining features, the cot–caught merger, has expanded into central Pennsylvania,[11] moving eastward until being blocked at Harrisburg.[12] Perhaps the only feature whose distribution is restricted almost exclusively to the immediate vicinity of Pittsburgh is /aʊ/ monophthongization in which words such as house, down, found, and sauerkraut are sometimes pronounced with an \"ah\" sound, instead of the more standard pronunciation of \"ow\", rendering eye spellings such as hahs, dahn, fahnd, and sahrkraht. Speakers of Pittsburgh English are sometimes called \"Yinzers\" in reference to their use of the second-person plural pronoun \"yinz.\" The word \"yinzer\" is sometimes heard as pejorative, indicating a lack of sophistication, but the term is now used in a variety of ways.[13] Older men are more likely to use the accent than women \"possibly because of a stronger interest in displaying local identity....\"[14] Phonology[edit] This section contains phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA. For the distinction between [ ], / / and ⟨ ⟩, see IPA § Brackets and transcription delimiters. Vowels of Western Pennsylvania English Front Central Back lax tense lax lax tense Close ɪ i ʊ u Mid ɛ ə Open æ ʌ ɒ Diphthongs eɪ aɪ ɔɪ aʊ oʊ A defining feature of Western Pennsylvania English is the cot–caught merger, in which /ɑ/ (as in ah) and /ɔ/ (as in aw) merge to a rounded /ɒ/ (phonetically [ɒ~ɔ]). As in most other American dialects, the father–bother merger also occurs.[6][7][15] Therefore, cot and caught are both pronounced /kɒt/; Don and dawn are both /dɒn/. While the merger of the low back vowels is also widespread elsewhere in the United States, the rounded realizations of the merged vowel around [ɒ] is less common, except in Canada, California and Northeastern New England.[6][7] /ɒ/ has a stylistic variant, which is open central unrounded [ä], as in the sarcastic pronunciation of I apologize as [aɪ əˈpʰäɫɨdʒaɪz]. It may also occur before /r/, as in start [stäɹʔt] or car [kʰäɹ], but a more common pronunciation is back and rounded: [stɒɹʔt] etc. The vowel in hoarse is the same as the one in horse, phonetically [ɔ]: [hɔɹs] but phonemically /oʊ/ due to the cot-caught merger: /hoʊrs/.[16][17] /ʌ/ is backer and more open than [ɜ] found in Midland American English, being closer to [ɑ]. This makes STRUT an unrounded counterpart of LOT, with pairs such as nut [nɑʔt] vs. not [nɒʔt] or cut [kʰɑʔt] vs. cot [kʰɒʔt] contrasting mainly by roundedness. This is also found in contemporary Standard Southern British English, where nut [nʌʔt] also differs from not [nɔʔt] by rounding (though nought has a contrastive THOUGHT vowel instead: [no̞ːʔt], which falls together with [ɒ] in Pittsburgh). Earlier reports give [ɜ] as the norm for STRUT in Pittsburgh. The remaining checked vowels /ɪ/, /ʊ/, /ɛ/ and /æ/ are all within the General American norm.[18][19][20] The GOAT vowel often has an unrounded central or fronted starting point in Pittsburgh: [əʊ]. Outside of the city itself, [oʊ] is more common. GOOSE is sometimes also fronted, to [ɨu] (more usual value: [ʊu]). As in other American dialects, FLEECE and FACE are narrow diphthongs [ɪi, ee̝]. CHOICE is also within GenAm norm: [ɔ̟ɪ].[21] The PRICE vowel alone undergoes Canadian raising to [ɜɪ] before voiceless consonants, as in ice [ɜɪs]. In 1971, the Journal of the International Phonetic Association published a description of the dialect, whose author Bruce Lee Johnson notes that the auxiliary verb might is typically pronounced with nasalization, as [mɜ̃ɪ̃ʔt].[22] Elsewhere in the article, this allophone is transcribed ⟨ʌɪ⟩, following its usual transcription on Wikipedia. The MOUTH vowel typically begins front in the mouth [æʊ]. A less common variant has a central starting point, [äʊ], matching the starting point of PRICE ([äɪ]).[16] It is monophthongized to [aː] in some environments (sounding instead like ah), namely: before nasal consonants (downtown [daːnˈtʰaːn] and found [faːnd]), liquid consonants (fowl, hour) and obstruents (house [haːs], out, cloudy).[6][7][15] The monophthongization does not occur, however, in word-final positions (how, now), and the diphthong then remains [æʊ].[23] That is one of the few features, if not the only one, restricted almost exclusively to western Pennsylvania in North America, but it can sometimes be found in other accents of the English-speaking world, such as Cockney and South African English.[6][7] The sound may be the result of contact from Slavic languages during the early 20th century.[7] Monophthongization also occurs for the sound /aɪ/, as in eye, before liquid consonants,[6][7][15][24] so that tile is pronounced [tʰɑːɫ]; pile is pronounced [pʰɑːɫ]; and iron is pronounced [ɑːɹn]. That phenomenon allows tire to merge with the sound of tar: [tʰɑːɹ]. The NURSE vowel (phonemically an /ər/ sequence) is phonetically close-mid [ɘ˞].[25] Johnson notes a tendency to diphthongize /æ/ to [ɛə] not only before nasals (as in GenAm) but also before all voiced consonants (as in bad [bɛəd]) and voiceless fricatives (as in grass [ɡɹɛəs]).[25] This has since been reversed and now [ɛə] is confined to the environment of a following nasal, matching the GenAm allophony.[26] An epenthetic (intruding) /r/ sound may occur after vowels in a few words, such as water pronounced as [ˈwɔɹɾɚ], and wash as [wɔɹʃ].[6][7] A number of vowel mergers occur uniquely in Western Pennsylvania English before the consonant /l/. The pair of vowels /i/ and /ɪ/ may merge before the /l/ consonant,[6][7][15][27] cause both steel and still to be pronounced as something like [stɪɫ]. Similarly, /u/, /oʊ/, and /ʊ/ may merge before /l/, so that pool, pull, and pole may merge to something like [pʰʊɫ]. On the /il/~/ɪl/ merger, Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006) note \"the stereotype of merger of /ɪl ~ il/ is based only on a close approximation of some forms, and does not represent the underlying norms of the dialect.\"[28] The /i/~/ɪ/ merger is found in western Pennsylvania,[6][7][15][27] as well as parts of the southern United States, including Alabama, Texas and the west (McElhinny 1999). On the other hand, the /u/~/ʊ/ merger is consistently found only in western Pennsylvania. The /i/~/ɪ/ merger towards [ɪ] may also appear before /ɡ/: eagle then sounds to outsiders like iggle.[6][7][15] L-vocalization is also common in the Western Pennsylvania dialect; an /l/ then sounds like a /w/ or a cross between a vowel and a \"dark\" /l/ at the end of a syllable.[6][7][29] For example, well is pronounced as [wɛw]; milk as [mɪwk] or [mɛwk]; role as [ɹʊw]; and cold as [ˈkʰʊwd]. The phenomenon is also common in African-American English. The word mirror can be pronounced as the single-syllable mere.[citation needed] Western Pennsylvania English speakers may use falling intonation at the end of questions,[6][7][30] for example, in \"Are you painting your garage?\" [↗ˈɒɹ jə ˈpʰeɪɾ̃ɪŋ jɚ ɡə↘ˈɹɒdʒ] (with pitch rising in intonation up to just before the last syllable and then falling precipitously).[30] Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes–no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. A speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what is already thought: yes, the person spoken to is painting their garage. It is most common in areas of heavy German settlement, especially southeastern Pennsylvania,[30] hence its nickname, the \"Pennsylvania Dutch question\", but it is also found elsewhere in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh.[6][7][30][31][32][33][34] It is of German origin.[30] Vocabulary[edit] City of Pittsburgh Recycling Drop-Off Center sign using the term \"redd up\", illustrating an example of Western Pennsylvania English. babushka - (n.) headscarf[3][a] buggy - (n.) shopping cart[b] baby buggy - (n.) baby carriage the 'Burgh - (n.)

For example, the phrase the butter's all would be understood as \"the butter is all gone.\" This likely derives from German.[54] \"Positive anymore\": In addition to the normal negative use of anymore it can also, as in the greater Midland U.S. dialect, be used in a positive sense to mean \"these days\" or \"nowadays\".[55][56][57] An example is \"I wear these shoes a lot anymore\". While in Standard English anymore must be used as a negative polarity item (NPI), some speakers in Pittsburgh and throughout the Midland area do not have this restriction.[52] This is somewhat common in both the Midland regions (Montgomery 1989) and in northern Maryland (Frederick, Hagerstown, and Westminster), likely of Scots-Irish origin.[57] Reversed usage of leave and let:[6][7][58] Examples of this include \"Leave him go outside\" and \"Let the book on the table\". Leave is used in some contexts in which, in standard English, let would be used; and vice versa. Used in Southwestern Pennsylvania and elsewhere, this is either Pennsylvania Dutch or Scots-Irish.[58] \"Need, want, or like + past participle\":[6][7][59] Examples of this include \"The car needs washed\", \"The cat wants petted\", and \"Babies like cuddled\". More common constructions are \"The grass needs cutting\" or \"The grass needs to be cut\" or \"Babies like cuddling\" or \"Babies like to be cuddled\"; \"The car needs washing\" or \"The car needs to be washed\"; and \"The cat wants petting\" or \"The cat wants to be petted.\" Found predominantly in the North Midland region, this is especially common in southwestern Pennsylvania.[60][61][62] Need + past participle is the most common construction, followed by want + past participle, and then like + past participle. The forms are \"implicationally related\" to one another (Murray and Simon 2002). This means the existence of a less common construction from the list in a given location entails the existence of the more common ones there, but not vice versa. The constructions \"like + past participle\" and \"need + past participle\" are Scots-Irish.[60][61][63][62] While Adams argues that \"want + past participle\" could be from Scots-Irish or German,[58] it seems likely that this construction is Scots-Irish, as Murray and Simon claim.[61][62] like and need + past participle are Scots-Irish, the distributions of all three constructions are implicationally related, the area where they are predominantly found is most heavily influenced by Scots-Irish, and a related construction, \"want + directional adverb\", as in \"The cat wants out\", is Scots-Irish.[37][52] \"Punctual whenever\": \"Whenever\" is often used to mean \"at the time that.\"[63] An example is \"My mother, whenever she passed away, she had pneumonia.\" A punctual descriptor refers to the use of the word for \"a onetime momentary event rather than in its two common uses for a recurrent event or a conditional one\". This Scots-Irish usage is found in the Midlands and the South. Notable examples of lifelong speakers[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

Art Rooney Dan Rooney See also[edit] Jagoff Midland American English Pennsylvania Dutch English Philadelphia accent Pittsburgh Dad Regional vocabularies of American English Yinztagram Notes[edit] ^ In Russian, Slovak, and many other Slavic languages, the word babushka (a familial/cute extension of the word baba) means \"grandmother\" or (endearingly) \"old woman.\" In Pittsburgh and much Northern U.S. English, the word also denotes a type of headscarf that might be worn by an old woman. Predominantly used in the northeast United States, babushka is most heavily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It is sometimes used as a derogatory term for an elderly woman, similar to calling someone an \"old hag.\"[citation needed] ^ Kurath (1949) mentions that speakers in a large portion of Pennsylvania use the term, but that it is \"very common in the Pittsburgh area[,]...[in] the adjoining counties of Ohio and on the lower Kanawha\" ^ According to Kurath (1949), this may be heard from the western edge of the Alleghenies to beyond the Ohio line ^ This is heard in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia. It origins are not entirely known, but rumored to have begun during the Depression Era, when people took meat scraps and fashioned a makeshift drumstick out of them. ^ Kurath (1949) claims these forms are used from the western edge of the Alleghenies to beyond the Ohio line; and Crozier claims that they are restricted to southwestern Pennsylvania, from Scots-Irish English origins. ^ Kurath 1949): This term is used from the western edge of the Alleghenies to beyond the Ohio line. ^ This can mean \"comfort\", as in \"He's been in poor hap since his wife died\",[31] or \"comforter or quilt,\" as in \"It was cold last night but that hap kept me warm.\" Hap is used for \"comfort\" in western Pennsylvania;[31] and a \"quilt\" is known as a hap only in western Pennsylvania. ^ a b The word is often followed by off to mean (as a verb) \"to annoy, irritate, play tricks on; to disparage; to reject\", or (as a noun) \"an annoying or irritating person;\" as well as around to mean \"annoy, tease, or engage in a frivolous endeavor.\" These phrases are probably influenced by jack off and jack around, respectively. \"Jus' jaggin'\" is a common expression, the same as standard \"just kidding\". Descended from Scots-Irish usage in English, this is chiefly a Pennsylvania term, especially southwestern Pennsylvania, but also portions of Appalachia. ^ The OED (1991) lists kolbasa as a variable pronunciation of kielbasa, and notes that the former pronunciation is Polish and the latter Russian. ^ The distribution of n'at is Southwestern Pennsylvania, possibly Scots-Irish. Macaulay (1995) finds it in the regular speech and narratives of Scottish coal miners in Glasgow, a principal area from which Scottish settlers emigrated to Northern Ireland, and from there, to the American colonies. ^ An example of this term is \"Yinz better redd up this room\". Dressman notes that it is common to the Pittsburgh area and throughout Pennsylvania, but less so in Philadelphia. It is also scattered about New England States and in New Brunswick, though its occurrence is heaviest in Pennsylvania. Hall states that its distribution is \"scattered, but chiefly N. Midland, esp PA\". Dressman suggested that it was brought to the U.S. by Scots. It's almost certainly of Scandinavian/Viking origin; the Danish \"rydde op\" means to clean up. \"Redd up\" and its associated variants probably entered the English language from old Norse.

History[edit] Main article: Western Pennsylvania English \"Yinzer\" (or \"Yunzer\") was historically used to identify the typical blue-collar people from the Pittsburgh region who often spoke with a heavy Pittsburghese accent. The term stems from the word yinz (or yunz), a second-person plural pronoun brought to the area by early Scottish-Irish immigrants.[1] Over time, yinzer has been used by many Pittsburgh residents to self-identify, even if they don't speak with a thick accent. The concept and use of the word gained popularity in the 21st century as the area's population loss slowed, and the city became a hub for revitalization. As the city gained note as a desirable place to live,[2][3] more outsiders have moved or returned to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The term has taken on a connotation to identify someone who is either a lifelong Pittsburgher, or says a phrase or commits an act that could be identified as something a stereotypical Pittsburgher might do.

It is a vertical bicolor triband of black and gold with the municipal coat of arms in the center. In 2004, the flag was ranked as the twenty-fourth best flag design out of 150 city flags by the North American Vexillological Association, and was the top-rated tricolor.[1] In tribute to the flag, all four professional athletic teams in Pittsburgh in the sports of baseball, football, hockey, and soccer are black and gold. The arms are based on those of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, namesake of the city. Design of the flag[edit] The flag is defined in the Code of Ordinances, City of Pittsburgh, Title I, Article I, Chapter 103, Section 3 as follows:[2] (a) The following shall be the forms, devices and colors of the City civic flag, ensign, pennant and streamer: the colors in the several forms shall be black and gold, of the hues or tints as expressed upon the pattern, and the exact copy of which is on file in the office of the City Clerk. (b) The civic flag, or standard of the City, shall be as follows: the material shall be American-made bunting or silk of the colors or hues above designated, ten (10) feet in length and six (6) feet in width, or in proportion thereto. The same shall be parted vertically per pale in three (3) equal parts, of which the first and [third] shall be black and the second or middle pale gold. Upon the latter shall be blazoned the City arms, as borne upon the City seal, and the same shall be blazoned upon the middle, and occupy one-third (1/3) of the surface thereof.

The Great Seal of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania The arms of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham form the basis for the arms of Pittsburgh Insignia[edit] Motto[edit] The phrase Benigno Numine was the motto of the Earl of Chatham. It is generally translated as \"With the Benevolent Deity\"[3] or \"By the Favour of the Heavens\".[4] It was adopted by the newly formed city in 1816 but somehow fell off seals and official documents and emblems in the early 20th century before being restored to the seal by City Council on July 3, 1950, and signed off by the Mayor on July 7, 1950. Even then, widespread use of the motto was not implemented until city council looked into the matter in November 1958.[5] Coat of arms and seal[edit] The city of Pittsburgh's coat of arms is based on the arms of William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham and the city's namesake.[6] The crest of the city's coat of arms serves as a sort of mural crown, featuring an image of a fortress. The Fraternal Order of Police, whose first lodge was founded in Pittsburgh, additionally features the city's coat of arms within its emblem. The official blazon of the city's coat of arms, as defined by a 1925 city ordinance, is as follows: On a field Sable, a fess chequay Argent et Azure, between three bezants bearing eagles rising with wings displayed and inverted Or. For crest, Sable a triple-towered castle masoned Argent.[7] The design of the seal of Pittsburgh, is defined in the Code of Ordinances, City of Pittsburgh, Title I, Article I, Chapter 103, Section 2 as follows:[2] (a) The great seal of the City and the lesser seals of the same shall be of the following design: (1) The great seal is a circle bearing in its center the arms and the crest of the City and upon its periphery a belt or band of Roman capital letters forming the legend \"The Seal of the City of Pittsburgh, 1816, Benigno Numine.\" (2) Lesser seals are the great seal of the City with this addition: on an arc of a circle having the same center as, but shorter radius than, the aforesaid legend, and placed directly below the City arms, the proper designation of the sealing office, as \"Office of the Mayor,\" \"Office of the City Clerk\" or the like, such designation to be in Roman capital letters, smaller than, but of like face to those used in the peripheral legend. (b) Hereafter all dies, engravings, plates or reproductions of the great seal and lesser seals of the City shall conform strictly to the aforesaid description, and the City arms and crest as used thereon shall adhere strictly to the official graphic rendering of the arms and crest as preserved in the archives in Council.

Lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler. The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Jaödeogë’ in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era[edit] Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years. These are some important villages, most c. 1750s, and earlier sites. For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3] By 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5] A map of Western Pennsylvania made in 1680 from the Darlington Collection In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6] Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]: 289 Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.[9] Early colonization (1747–1763)[edit] British and French Forts, 1753–1758, and the routes of the two British campaigns to take the forks of the Ohio The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10] Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail[12] now known as Nemacolin's Trail. The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track. The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.[6] Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.[12] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.[13] In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, an advance party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.[14] Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw.[15] Accompanied by Christopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753. George Washington's sketch of Monongahela River, Allegheny River (named as the upper Ohio), and French Creek that accompanied his journal (1753) in which he recorded his impressions:[16] As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building. Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.[15] Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15] Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.[18] After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.[15][19] The Fort Pitt Blockhouse, dating to 1764, is the oldest structure in Pittsburgh.[15] In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains. Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.[20] In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.[21] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.[15] On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.[21] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne.[21] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh).[11][15] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.[11] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat.[15] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River. Gateway to the West (1763–1799)[edit] In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]: 148 After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15] Fort Pitt, 1795 The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4] Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4] With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4] Map of Pittsburgh in 1795 After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24] The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25] Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27] Year City Population[11][21][28][29]: 80 [30] 1761 332 1796 1,395 1800 1,565 Iron City (1800–1859)[edit] Second Court House, completed 1841[31] Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11] The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the \"City of bridges\" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27] Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.[33] Great Fire of Pittsburgh, 1845 Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.[34] Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.[31] As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[27] In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31] 939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City employing more than 10K workers producing almost $12M in goods using 400 steam engines Total coal consumed — 22M bushels Total iron consumed — 127K tons In steam tonnage, third busiest port in the nation, surpassed only by New York City and New Orleans.

Scots Irish leadership[edit] Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\"[36] New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813–1908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806–1882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\"[37] Technology[edit] In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39] Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse's advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39] Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42] Geography of industrialization[edit] Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43] Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44] A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45] By about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46] Numbered map showing locations of several industrial holdings and other important sites from about 1910. Westinghouse Air Brake: 25th Street and Liberty Avenue Westinghouse Air Brake: Allegheny City Westinghouse Air Brake: Wilmerding Union Switch & Signal and Westinghouse Electric: Garrison Alley Union Switch and Signal: Swissvale First Westinghouse home and gas wells: \"Solitude\" Haymaker gas wells: Murrysville Other gas wells: Murrysville Fuel gas line: Murrysville to Pittsburgh Edgar Thomson Works of Carnegie Steel: Braddock Carnegie Steel Company: Homestead Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing: East Pittsburgh Westinghouse Machine Company Westinghouse Foundries: Trafford Machine politics[edit] Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47] Germans[edit] During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49] Labor unions[edit] As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots.[50] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes. Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, July 21–22, 1877 In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike. Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance. Carnegie[edit] Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.[51] He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39] The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27] Steelworker watching molten steel being poured into a mold, J&L Steel, Pittsburgh, May 1942. Early 20th century[edit] By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21] Nexus of a vast railway system, with freight yards capable of handling 60K cars 27.2 miles (43.8 km) of harbor Yearly river traffic in excess of 9M tons Value of factory products more than $211M (with Allegheny City) Allegheny county produced, as percentage of national output, about: 24% of the pig iron 34% of the Bessemer steel 44% of the open hearth steel 53% of the crucible steel 24% of the steel rails 59% of the structural shapes Prohibition[edit] During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55] The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57] Environment[edit] During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58] In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59] To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60] High culture[edit] Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39] Downtown Pittsburgh panorama, from 1920. New immigrants and migrants[edit] Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39] African Americans[edit] Further information: Great Migration (African American) The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.[63][64] Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process: Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.[65] The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area: Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the Pittsburgh Courier); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.[66] The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.[39] 1930s[edit] Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[67] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.[68][69] Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only \"a challenge\" but also \"an opportunity\". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.[70] 1940s[edit] Pittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11] Postwar[edit] David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73] Year City Population City Rank[35] 1860 49,221 17 1870 86,076 16 1880 156,389 12 1890 238,617 13 1900 321,616 11 1910 533,905 8 1920 588,343 9 1930 669,817 10 1940 671,659 10 1950 676,806 12 Renaissance I (1946–1973)[edit] \"Pittsburgh Renaissance\" redirects here. For the basketball team, see Pittsburgh Rens. The multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project. It was imploded in 2001. Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers. Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon, chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin[74][75] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city[11] in unforeseen ways. \"Renaissance I\" began in 1946. Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin. By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.[27] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[76] Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built. In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district. In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979. Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans. The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the Mexican War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the \"pedestrianized\" Allegheny Center Mall and apartments. The city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era[77] partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC.[78][79] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.[11] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium.[27] In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed.[80] Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations. Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods.[81] Reinvention (1973–present)[edit] Downtown Pittsburgh in July 1974 A similar picture of Downtown Pittsburgh from Mt. Washington in December 2005 During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.[citation needed] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.[11][82] The era began with the RIDC's \"Building on Basics\" report in 1974.[83] Collapse of steel[edit] Further information: Steel crisis Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable \"mini-mills\" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.[82] Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S.[84] Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.[82] The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.[85][86] The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs.[87] Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.[88] In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base. Corporations[edit] Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1996) and Rockwell International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the \"brain drain\") as well as massive charitable contributions by the \"home based\" companies to local cultural and educational institutions. At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier. Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day. Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock. Higher education[edit] Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.[89] Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University, Chatham University, Carlow University, Point Park University, La Roche College, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the Community College of Allegheny County. Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).[90][91] Civic improvements[edit] Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued. In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies. Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh. In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice. Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.[92] During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.[27] In the 1980s, the \"Renaissance II\" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.[27] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened.[27] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.[93] Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.[94] Pittsburgh today[edit] Present-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and education and culture, has been ranked as one of the World's Most Livable Cities.[95] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities. Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.[96] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh. As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies. The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center. In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.[97] Year City Population City Rank[35] Population of the Urbanized Area[98] 1950 676,806 12 1,533,000 1960 604,332 16 1,804,000 1970 540,025 24 1,846,000 1980 423,938 30 1,810,000 1990 369,879 40 1,678,000 2000 334,563 51 1,753,000 2010 307,484[99] 61[99] 1,733,853 (Ranked 27th, between San Antonio and Sacramento)[100] Jurisdiction timeline[edit] Possibly as early as 17,000 BCE, and until approximately 1750 CE, the area was home to numerous Native American groups, including the Lenape and Seneca tribes. 1669 Claimed for the French Empire by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. 1681 King Charles claims the forks for Pennsylvania with 5 degrees west of the Delaware. 1694 Arnout Viele a Dutch trader explores the area.[101] 1717 Settled by European traders, primarily Pennsylvanians; dispute occurs between Virginia and Pennsylvania. 1727 Joncaire visits with a small French force. 1748 Both Pennsylvanian Conrad Weiser visits and the Kingd approves the Ohio Company for Virginia. 1749 Frenchman Louis Blainville deCeleron sails by on the Allegheny and Ohio burying lead plates claiming the area for France. 1750 Cumberland County Pennsylvania founded, though its jurisdiction is not governable. 1753 George Washington visits en route to Fort LeBeouf. 1754 French Forces occupy the area and construct Fort Duquesne. 1757 Jesuit Father Claude Francis Virot founded Catholic Mission at Beaver. 1758 British Forces regain the area and establish Fort Pitt though some dispute over claims between the colonies of Pennsylvania (Cumberland County) and Virginia (Augusta County). 1761 Ayr Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. 1763 The Proclamation of 1763 grants Quebec rights to all lands west of the Alleghenies and North of the Ohio River. 1767 Bedford Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.[102] 1770 George Washington visits for Virginia. 1771 (March 9) Bedford County, Pennsylvania.[102] 1771 (April 16) Pitt Township founded.[103] 1773 (February 26) part of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. 1788 (September 24) part of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 1788 (December 16) A new Pitt Township is formed as a division of Allegheny County.[104] 1792 (June) Petition for a Pittsburgh Township at the forks. 1792 (September 6) Pittsburgh Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 1794 (April 22) Pittsburgh borough, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.[105] 1816 (March 18) City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

The name of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has a complicated history. Pittsburgh is one of the few U.S. cities or towns to be spelled with an h at the end of a burg suffix, although the spelling Pittsburg was acceptable for many years and was even held as standard by the federal government (but not the city government) from 1891 to 1911. Etymology[edit] Pittsburgh was named in honor of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, often referred to as William Pitt the Elder to distinguish him from his son William Pitt the Younger. The suffix burgh is the Scots language and Scottish English cognate of the English language borough, which has other cognates in words and place names in several Indo-European languages. Historically, this morpheme was used in place names to describe a location as being defensible, such as a hill, a fort, or a fortified settlement.[1][note 1] History and spellings[edit] Pittsburgh is spelled without the h in its 1816 city charter. Advertisement for The Pittsburg Dispatch from 1876. The newspaper used the Pittsburg spelling from its second year (1847) to its end of publication in 1923.[2] Pittsburgh was so named when British forces captured Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War (Seven Years War). The earliest known references to the new name of the settlement are in letters sent by General John Forbes, dated 26 and 27 November 1758, reporting the capture of the fort. In copies of and quotes from those letters in later sources, the name of Pittsburgh is spelled with and without the h, and sometimes with an o before the u.[note 2] As a Scotsman, General Forbes probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə, similar to the pronunciation of \"Edinburgh\" as a Scotsman would say it: /ˈɛdɪnbərə/ ⓘ ED-in-bər-ə.[10][11][12] The name appeared in print at least as early as 14 December 1758, when the Pennsylvania Gazette published a letter written by a member of Forbes's army from \"Pittsburgh (formerly Fort Duquesne)\".[13] For a long time, there was little regard for uniformity in the spelling of Pittsburgh's name.[14] Early municipal documents and city directories generally spelled the name with a final h,[15] but the letter is notably omitted in the city charter enacted by the state legislature in 1816.[14] The variance in spelling persisted through the 19th century. In 1890, some local newspapers were using the final h and some were not.[14] Relative frequency of Pittsburgh (blue) vs. Pittsburg (red) word forms in English-language books over time, according to Google Ngram Viewer data. Usage of Pittsburg has practically disappeared except in errors or in reference to places other than the Pennsylvania city. The name of the city was normally spelled without an h in German (including Pennsylvania Dutch), in which geographical names ending in -burg and -berg (and never followed by an h) are very common. Federal board decisions[edit] In 1890, the United States Board on Geographic Names was created to establish uniform place name usage throughout the various departments and agencies of the U.S. government. To guide its standardization efforts, the Board adopted thirteen general principles, one of which was that the final -h should be dropped from place names ending in -burgh.[16] The Board compiled a report of place name \"decisions\" in 1891 in which Pittsburgh's name for federal government purposes was rendered Pittsburg.[17][note 3] In support of its decision favoring the Pittsburg spelling, the Board referenced the 1816 city charter. The full decision and rationale from the Board follows: Pittsburg. Pennsylvania.The city was chartered in 1816, its name being spelled without the h, and its official form is still Pittsburg. The h appears to have been added by the Post-Office Department, and through that action local usage appears to have become divided. While the majority of local newspapers print it without the h, certain others use the final h.[18] The Board's decisions were compulsory upon all federal government agencies, including the Post Office. Outside the federal government, the decisions, while highly influential,[17] were not officially binding.[19] The Pittsburgh city government continued to use the spelling with the h,[10] as did such local institutions as the Pittsburgh Gazette, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] In 1908, a Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce committee, after conducting a review of historical documents, endorsed Pittsburgh as the proper way to spell the city's name and looked toward getting that spelling federally recognized.[20] Responding to mounting pressure and, in the end, political pressure from senator George T. Oliver, the names board reversed itself and added an h to its spelling of the city on July 19, 1911.[14] The letter sent to Senator Oliver to announce this decision, dated July 20, stated: Hon. George T. Oliver, United States Senate: Sir: At a special meeting of the United States Geographic Board held on July 19, 1911, the previous decision with regard to the spelling of Pittsburgh without a final H was reconsidered and the form given below was adopted: Pittsburgh, a city in Pennsylvania (not Pittsburg). Very respectfully, C. S. SLOAN, Secretary.[21] With the spelling controversy largely settled, the h-less form of the city's name headed toward extinction. There were some holdouts: the city's largest-circulation newspaper, The Pittsburg Press, adhered to the shorter spelling until 1921;[22] The Pittsburg Dispatch and The Pittsburg Leader did so until ceasing publication in 1923.[23] Many cities across the United States named after the city of Pittsburgh, such as Pittsburg, Kansas, Pittsburg, California, and West Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, continue to use the Pittsburg spelling in their names. Other independent municipalities, such as the borough of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reflect the modern spelling. Baseball card[edit] Main article: T206 Honus Wagner The T-206 Honus Wagner baseball card from 1909 Perhaps the most familiar reference to the Pittsburg spelling is on the renowned 1909 T-206 baseball card of Pittsburgh Pirates legend Honus Wagner. Its scarcity, even at the time, combined with Wagner's reputation as one of the greatest players in baseball history, made it the most valuable sports card of all time, with one pristine specimen yielding $6.61 million (equivalent to $7.67 million in 2024)[24] at auction.[25] It has been characterized as the \"Holy Grail\" of baseball cards.[26] The city name displayed across Wagner's jersey on the card was an artistic addition that did not actually appear on the Pirates' uniforms of the time.[27][28] The portrait of Wagner makes it appear as if there could be an H on the end, cut off by the border of the picture, but this notion is countered by the appearance of \"PITTSBURG\" in the underlying caption and on other Pirate portraits from the T-206 card set. The -h in Pittsburgh culture[edit] The presence of the -h at the end of the word Pittsburgh is occasionally recognized in Pittsburgh culture. It is often rendered as PGH. For example, Pittsburgh International Airport's abbreviation is PIT, while Union Station's abbreviation is PGH. The area's Fox affiliate takes its call sign, WPGH-TV, from that. Additionally, the Pittsburgh Pirates city connect jerseys feature PGH written across the chest. A recent playful take on the final -h of Pittsburgh appears in the name of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority's brand of bottled water: PGH2O, which is a portmanteau of the abbreviation PGH and the chemical name for water, H2O.[29] \"Da 'Burgh\" or \"Da Burgh\" is a local and affectionate nickname for the city. In homage to the city's history, the \"Pittsburg Plunge\" at Kennywood Park retains the alternate spelling without the h. See also[edit] Alburgh, Vermont, a town whose name was changed from Alburgh to Alburg in the 19th century, apparently by influence of the same 1891 decision that applied to the spelling of Pittsburgh. The Alburgh spelling was restored in 2006. Newburgh, New York, another early U.S. city with a trailing h. Plattsburgh, New York, another early U.S. city with a trailing h, located in the northeastern corner of the state. Pittsburg (disambiguation), other places with the h-less spelling Notes[edit] ^ See Etymology of Burgh for more details. ^ The form of the name appearing in a letter sent by Forbes to Lieutenant-Governor William Denny, dated 26 November 1758, is given in discrepant sources as Pittsbourg,[3] Pitts-Bourgh,[4] Pitts-Bourg,[5] Pittsburgh,[6] and Pittsburg.[7] The name appearing in other letters has been transcribed as Pittsbourg (Forbes to Generals Abercromby and Amherst, 26 November 1758),[8] and Pittsbourgh (Forbes to William Pitt, 27 November 1758).[6][9] ^ Because the Board lacked the immediate means to publish and distribute its decisions (see pp. 9–10 of the report), its report was not actually printed in volume and distributed until 1892. The actual finalized decisions and recommendations do date to 1891, however. References[edit] ^ Harper, Douglas. \"Borough\". Online Etymology Dictionary.

(May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation Jews have lived in and around Pittsburgh since the mid-19th century. In 2002, Jewish households represented 3.8% of households in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.[1] As of 2017, there were an estimated 50,000 Jews in the Greater Pittsburgh area.[2] In 2012, Pittsburgh's Jewish community celebrated its 100th year of federated giving through the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.[3] The city's Jewish federation is one of the oldest in the country, marking the deep historical roots of Jews in Pittsburgh. Founding[edit] Former synagogue on Miller Street near downtown Pittsburgh, August 2007. There are no reliable records of the beginnings of the Pittsburgh Jewish community, but it has been ascertained that between 1838 and 1844 a small number of Jews, mostly from Baden, Bavaria, and Württemberg, Germany settled in and around Pittsburgh. These communities continued to expand from 1847 until 1852. Though the first official Jewish service was held in the autumn of 1844, Jews in Pittsburgh did not officially organize until 1847, when several men worshiped in a room on Penn Street and Walnut (now 13th) Street, having engaged the Rev. Mannheimer as cantor. After this meeting, the men also formed a Bes Almon Society and purchased a cemetery at Troy Hill. This newly formed organization lacked homogeneity due to the varying religious views of its members, and divisions and reunions took place from time to time until about 1853, when a united congregation was formed under the name Rodef Shalom. In 1864 a small group of congregants dissatisfied with the movement toward Reform practices at Rodef Shalom formed a breakaway Orthodox congregation, Etz Chayyim (Tree of Life), and purchased a cemetery at Sharpsburg. By 1886, Etz Chayyim, now called Tree of Life Congregation, had affiliated itself with the Conservative movement. In the broader American Jewish community, Pittsburgh is also famous for the 1885 \"Pittsburgh Platform\" which articulated bold and radical new ideas from the Reform movement on approaching theology and the modern world.[4] At the turn of the century, two or three synagogues were established in or on the fringe of the area which is now called the Lower Hill District. One old building near Elm Street (called the \"Old Jewish Church\" by some)[who?] was demolished and replaced. A group called Beth Hamedrash Hagodol-Beth Jacob Congregation meets in the new synagogue. At least one old building has survived on nearby Miller Street in the area once known colloquially as \"Jews Hill\"[citation needed], although it has since been converted into a church. Philanthropic associations[edit] Pittsburgh is notable in American Jewish history on account of the conference (see Jew. Encyc. iv. 215, s.v. Conferences, Rabbinical) held there in 1885, and is also well-known as a generous supporter of national Jewish movements, notably the Hebrew Union College and the Denver Hospital. Among the more prominent local philanthropic and charitable institutions may be mentioned the following: J. M. Gusky Orphanage and Home, with the Bertha Rauh Cohen Annex. The Home was founded in 1890 by Esther Gusky, in memory of her husband, Jacob Mark Gusky. The Annex was the gift in 1889 of Aaron Cohen in memory of his wife, Bertha Rauh Cohen, the only daughter of Rosalia Rauh and the late Solomon Rauh. The Home had 62 inmates, an annual income of about $10,000, and an endowment fund of $67,000.[when?] It closed in 1943.[5] The United Hebrew Relief Association, a union of the Hebrew Benevolent Society and the Hebrew Ladies' Aid Society. It paid for the care of the sick and for funerals as well as purchasing coal for families.[6] It dispensed $10,000 yearly, and had a sinking-fund of $29,000.[when?] The Columbian Council School, also known as the Irene Kaufmann Settlement, a social settlement. It conducted a large number of classes and public lectures and contained a library, public baths, and gymnasium. The bath-house was the gift of Alexander Peacock. The disbursements were about $6,000 annually.[when?] The Hebrew Ladies' Hospital Aid Society secured and paid for hospital attention for the sick poor. It had an annual income of about $8,000[when?], and funded the construction of the Montefiore Hospital. The organization continues to exist as the Ladies Hospital Aid Society, helping the community of western Pennsylvania.[7] The Young Ladies' Sewing Society, which dispensed clothing to the poor; its income was about $2,000 annually.[when?] The Concordia Club, now known as the O'Hara Student Center, fostered Jewish social life in Pittsburgh from its opening in 1874 until it closed in 2009. The Council of Jewish Women continues to help families, women, and children since its founding in 1893.[8] Newspapers[edit] There were two weekly newspapers for the Jewish community. The Jewish Criterion, in English, was published from 1895–1962, of which Rabbi Levy and Charles H. Joseph were the editors. Another newspaper was in Yiddish and Hebrew, known as Der Volksfreund[9] from its founding in 1889 and later renamed to Der Idisher Folksfreynd,[10] which was in circulation from 1922–1924. Since 1962, the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle is published weekly for the Jewish community of the Greater Pittsburgh Region. Prominent Jews[edit] Donors to non-sectarian charities included J.D. Bernd and Isaac Kaufmann, the latter of whom in 1895 gave the Emma Kaufmann Free Clinic to the medical department of the University of Pittsburgh. Among those who held positions in public life are Emanuel Wertheimer, select councilman and member of the state House of Representatives; Morris Einstein, select councilman (15 years); Josiah Cohen, judge of the Orphans' Court; E.E. Mayer, city physician; L.S. Levin, assistant city attorney. Isaac W. Frank was president of the National Founders' Association, and A. Leo Weil was a member of the executive committee of the Voters' Civic League. There was a steady increase since 1882 in the number of Jewish people in Pittsburgh, the new settlers coming mostly from eastern Europe. Russian, Romanian, and Hungarian Jews came in large numbers and began to display an appreciable interest in public affairs. They had six synagogues in 1906 (whose rabbis included Aaron M. Ashinsky and M.S. Sivitz), many ḥebras, and a number of small religious societies. The Pittsburgh Jewry strongly sympathized with the Zionist movement, having a large number of Zionist societies. The number of Jewish inhabitants in 1906 was estimated at between 15,000 and 25,000, in a total population of about 322,000. Some notable Jews from Pittsburgh include rapper and record producer Mac Miller, entrepreneur and television personality Mark Cuban, and actor and musician Jeff Goldblum.[11][12][13] Squirrel Hill[edit] Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood is considered to be the city's primary Jewish hub. Nearly half of the population of Squirrel Hill is Jewish.[14] Squirrel Hill has had a large Jewish population since the 1920s, when Jewish people began to move to the neighborhood in large numbers from the Oakland and Hill District neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. According to a 2002 study by the United Jewish Federation, 33% of the Pittsburgh Jewish population lived in Squirrel Hill and another 14% in the surrounding area.[15] Squirrel Hill currently contains three Jewish day schools, catering to the Lubavich, Orthodox, and Conservative movements. There are over twenty synagogues. This Jewish community also offers four restaurants, a Jewish community center, and an annual festival. Synagogue shooting[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh synagogue shooting On October 27, 2018, a right-wing extremist attacked Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation[a] synagogue in Squirrel Hill. The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during Shabbat morning services on October 27, 2018. The perpetrator killed eleven people and wounded six, including several Holocaust survivors.[17][18] The shooting was the deadliest attack on a local Jewish community in American history.[19][20] The perpetrator, identified as 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers,[21] was shot multiple times by police and arrested at the scene.[22] Bowers had earlier posted antisemitic comments against HIAS (formerly, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) on the online alt-tech social network Gab.[23][24][25] Dor Hadash[26] had participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the previous week. Referring to Central American migrant caravans and immigrants, Bowers posted a message on Gab in which he wrote that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"[27][28] He was charged with 63 federal crimes, some of which are capital crimes.[22] He pleaded not guilty.[22] On June 16, 2023, he was found guilty on all federal counts, and on August 3, 2023, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection.[29] Gaza war[edit] The community was divided by the 2023 Gaza war, with some backing Israel and others calling for a ceasefire.[30][31] In 2024 two people (one of them Jewish[32]) were arrested for spray-painting pro-Palestinian graffiti on a Chabad synagogue and the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.[33] See also[edit] Judaism portalPennsylvania portal American Jewish Museum Culture of Pittsburgh History of Pittsburgh History of the Jews in Pennsylvania Pittsburgh (Hasidic dynasty) Bibliography[edit] History of Congregation Rodeph Shalom, 1899 articles in the Jewish Criterion, 1901 American Israelite, 1893 Notes[edit] ^ Hebrew: עֵץ חַיִּים – אוֹר לְשִׂמְחָה[16] References[edit] ^ \"Jewish Household and Population Estimates\".

The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during Shabbat morning services. The perpetrator killed eleven people and wounded six, in the deadliest attack on a local Jewish community in American history.[7] The perpetrator, 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers,[8] was shot multiple times by police and arrested at the scene.[9] Bowers had earlier posted antisemitic comments against HIAS (formerly, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) on the online alt-tech social network Gab.[10][11][12] Dor Hadash[13] had participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the previous week. Referring to Central American migrant caravans and immigrants, Bowers posted a message on Gab in which he wrote that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"[14] He was charged with 63 federal crimes, some of them capital crimes.[9] Bowers pleaded not guilty.[9] In 2023 he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death by lethal injection.[15] Background[edit] Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation is a Conservative Jewish synagogue. The synagogue describes itself as a \"traditional, progressive, and egalitarian congregation\".[16] It is located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of downtown Pittsburgh.[16][17] The Squirrel Hill neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Jewish neighborhoods in the United States and has historically been the center of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. About 26 percent of the city's Jewish population live in the area.[18][19][20] Originally founded as an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1864 in downtown Pittsburgh, by an early group of Jewish immigrants, Tree of Life merged in 2010 with the recently founded Congregation Or L'Simcha.[21] The modern synagogue building, located at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues in Squirrel Hill, was built in 1953. The congregation also rents space to Dor Hadash,[c] a Reconstructionist congregation; and New Light, another Conservative congregation.[22][23][24] The synagogue's main sanctuary has a capacity of 1,250 people.[25] Squirrel Hill has a low crime rate and is not generally regarded as racially tense. However, local rabbinic student Neal Rosenblum was murdered in the neighborhood in 1986 in an antisemitic hate crime.[26] This 2018 mass shooting took place soon after Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League independently reported a spike in antisemitic activity online, especially on the popular social networking platforms Instagram and Twitter.[27][28][29][30] In addition, other antisemitic acts had been committed elsewhere.[31] The immediate rise in the months of August to October 2018 was attributed to rising tensions associated with advertising for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.[32] A similar rise in online attacks had occurred during the 2016 US election,[27] with the midterms being a \"rallying point\" for far-right extremists to organize efforts to spread antisemitism online among the populace.[28] In 2017, there was a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States,[30][29] in context of rising hate crimes against other groups, including Muslims and African Americans, as reported by the FBI.[30] For instance, hundreds of Jewish gravestones were vandalized in Pennsylvania and Missouri,[28] and antisemitic incidents on university campuses doubled in number.[31] In August 2017, the widely publicized Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia featured Nazi symbols, salutes, and the slogan \"Blood and Soil\",[31] among other racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Considerable antisemitic material was being spread online via conspiracy theories about wealthy Jewish individuals, including billionaire George Soros. Columbia University's Jon Albright said that these represented the \"worst sample\" of all the hate speech he had seen on Instagram.[27] Shooting[edit] At 9:45 a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), three religious services were underway in the Tree of Life synagogue, which housed three distinct congregations. Tree of Life and New Light had both begun independent Shabbat morning service in the Pervin Chapel[33] and basement, respectively. The Dor Hadash congregants were gathered near the front of the building, prior to their 10:00 a.m. Torah study session.[34] Five minutes later, a gunman, identified as Robert Bowers and described as a \"bearded heavy-set white male\", entered the building, opened fire and was \"shooting for about 20 minutes.\"[35] He was armed with a Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifle (cited by authorities as an \"assault rifle\")[3] and three Glock .357 SIG semi-automatic pistols, all four of which he fired, according to authorities.[7][36][17][37] There would typically be around 75 people in the building on a Saturday morning.[33] The first two persons shot were two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal, at the main entrance, after which Bowers headed downstairs to New Light. Some hearing the shots did not initially recognize them for what they were: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, located upstairs, thought a coat rack had fallen and clattered.[38] By 9:54, police began receiving multiple calls from people barricaded in the building and reporting the attack.[39][40][41] At 9:55,[42] Melvin Wax, the leader of New Light's services, hid in a pitch-black closet in the basement. He opened the door of the closet, and Bowers immediately shot him. The latter did not notice the other three congregants who remained in the closet. Two other members of New Light, Gottfried and Stein, were shot and killed in the basement kitchen.[33] Bowers also killed Jerry Rabinowitz of Dor Hadash, a physician who had gone toward the sound of gunshots to see if anyone had been hurt.[33] At 9:57,[42] Bowers left the basement and headed upstairs to the larger Tree of Life service. About 13 worshippers had gathered for the Shabbat service in an upstairs chapel. Myers helped four of them evacuate the chapel through a side door, but eight of the worshippers remained behind. Bowers killed seven of them and wounded the eighth.[33][43] Police sources said Bowers shouted at some point during the attack, \"All Jews must die!\"[39][44] At 9:59, police arrived at the synagogue.[40][45] Bowers fired on police from the entryway while apparently departing, and police returned fire, forcing him to retreat into the building.[33][46] A half-hour later, tactical teams entered the building, and Bowers also fired upon them. When officers wounded him in return fire, he retreated to the third floor and hid in a room.[40] He had wounded two officers and two SWAT members, one of them critically.[46] At 11:08, Bowers crawled out of the room and surrendered, having been shot multiple times.[47] As he received medical care in police custody, he allegedly told a SWAT officer that he wanted Jews to die and that Jews were committing genocide against his people.[48] Bowers discharged his rifle 67 times during the shooting.[49] Victims[edit] Memorials to victims outside the Tree of Life synagogue Plaque listing the victims' names. By the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem Eleven people were killed,[50][51][52] including three on the ground level and four in the synagogue's basement.[53] Among the dead were two brothers and a married couple.[35][54] At least six others were injured, including four Pittsburgh Police officers.[55][39] Five people were transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, four requiring surgery, while one was treated and released by the afternoon. Another victim was transported to UPMC Mercy, while the accused was taken to Allegheny General Hospital.[56] Those killed were: Joyce Fienberg, 75, a retired University of Pittsburgh research specialist Richard Gottfried, 65, a dentist Rose Mallinger, 97, an active congregant at the synagogue for more than 60 years Jerry Rabinowitz, 65, a family physician Cecil, 59 & David Rosenthal, 54, brothers who lived together at a community home for people with disabilities Bernice, 84 & Sylvan Simon, 86, a retired couple who celebrated their wedding at Tree of Life in 1956 Daniel Stein, 71, a retired salesman and substitute school teacher Melvin Wax, 87, a retired accountant who was leading services at the time of the shooting Irving Younger, 69, a retired real estate company owner, who served as a greeter at the synagogue Seven others were injured in the incident, which included three other congregants and four Pittsburgh officers (two patrol officers and two SWAT officers; three by ricocheted gunfire and another by glass fragments).[33] Perpetrator[edit] Robert Bowers (born September 4, 1972),[57] a resident of Baldwin, Pennsylvania, was arrested as the shooter.[58][59][60] Bowers' parents divorced when he was about one year old.[61] While Bowers was seven years old, his father, Randall G. Bowers of the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Garfield, died by suicide on October 15, 1979 at the age of 26 while he was awaiting trial on a rape charge in connection of an April 27, 1979 rape of a 20-year-old woman in Squirrel Hill.[62][61][62][63] Authorities confirmed that his body, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest, was found under a picnic table near the Tionesta Dam in Tionesta, Pennsylvania with antidepressant drugs next to him. Police also recovered his .22 caliber rifle at the scene.[64] Bowers's mother was remarried in 1975, with the family briefly living in Florida before the couple separated the following year in 1976.[61] Upon their return to Pennsylvania, Bowers and his mother lived with his mother's parents in Whitehall, a suburb of Pittsburgh. His maternal grandparents took responsibility for raising him because his mother suffered from health problems.[61] Bowers attended Baldwin High School in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District from August 1986 to November 1989. He dropped out of high school before graduation and worked as a trucker for 13 years until 2002.[65][66] Neighbors described Bowers as \"a ghost\" who rarely interacted with others.[58] According to accounts which were given by Bowers' coworkers, and analysis of his recent social media posts, his conservatism became radicalized as white nationalism; at one point in the late-1990s, Bowers was fascinated by the right-wing radio host Jim Quinn, who at the time was on WRRK.[67] At a later time, he became a follower of \"aggressive online provocateurs of the right wing's fringe.\"[68] He was deeply involved in posting comments on social media websites such as Gab and he also promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories on them.[69] Bowers routinely discussed a conspiracy theory that Jews were assisting \"evil Muslims\" to take over the United States together.[70] Gab has been described as friendly to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the alt-right.[71] Bowers registered his Gab profile in January 2018 under the handle \"onedingo\"; he described his account by the following: \"Jews are the children of Satan (John 8:44). The Lord Jesus Christ [has] come in the flesh.\" The cover picture was a photo with the number 1488, which is used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists to evoke David Lane's \"Fourteen Words\" and the Nazi slogan Heil Hitler. Bowers published posts that supported the white genocide conspiracy theory, such as one that said, \"Daily Reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person\".[72] Bowers said that supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory were \"deluded\" and being tricked.[73][74][75] Bowers was very active on social media, posting his own similar antisemitic and racist rants. He often re-posted content by other similarly minded users, such as Patrick Little, who expressed antisemitic, neo-Nazi, white nationalist/supremacist thoughts and denied the Holocaust. In addition, he reposted comments in support of the four men behind the beating of DeAndre Harris and the Southern California-based alt-right fight club Rise Above Movement (RAM) in the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. RAM was later arrested by the FBI and convicted at trial for violence against counter-demonstrators. Bowers also posted comments in support of the \"Western chauvinist\" Proud Boys led by Gavin McInnes, who were arrested the same month for engaging in a fight with Antifa outside the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City.[76][77][78][79][80][81] His posts on Gab mentioned that he was initially a supporter of US president Donald Trump.[76] Bowers felt that Trump was not extreme enough, and he criticized him as \"globalist, not a nationalist\"[82] and suggested Trump was being controlled by Jews.[83] Bowers also denounced African Americans with racial slurs and images which are related to lynchings, and he also denounced white women who have relationships with Black men.[84] He used his online accounts to post conspiracy theories regarding philanthropist George Soros.[85] The Times said that security sources had alleged that Bowers had links to the far-right and neo-Nazis in the United Kingdom.[86] A month before the attack, Bowers posted photos of results of his target practice. He also posted a photo of his three handguns, calling them his \"glock family\".[79] In the post, he identified the .357 SIG handguns as Glock 31, Glock 32, and Glock 33.[78] Bowers coordinated with Brad Griffin (aka Hunter Wallace) of Occidental Dissent, an alt-right associated blogger and member of League of the South on doxxing an unidentified left-wing blogger. Bowers wrote \"that address is not the most current for him. I can get you the most recent outside of gab\".[87] League of the South was one of the organizations that participated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville.[87] In the weeks before the shooting, Bowers made antisemitic posts directed at the HIAS-sponsored[11][12] National Refugee Shabbat[88] of October 19–20, in which Dor Hadash[13] participated. He claimed Jews were aiding members of Central American caravans moving toward the United States border and referred to those migrants as \"invaders\".[10] Shortly before the attack, he posted on Gab that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"[51][89][60] According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"the mention of 'optics' references a disagreement that has raged within the white nationalist movement since the Unite the Right rally in 2017 about how best to get their message across to the general public\".[90] After the shooting, Gab suspended Bowers's profile and pledged to cooperate with the criminal investigation.[73][81] Shortly after the attack, PayPal, Stripe, Joyent, and Medium pulled their support for Gab, and GoDaddy, under which the Gab domains were registered, required Gab to relocate their domain name hosting to a different service, effectively shutting Gab down in the short term.[91] Criminal charges and proceedings[edit] Federal criminal proceedings[edit] Indictment and pretrial proceedings[edit] Bowers was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 29 federal crimes.[36][92] Bowers appeared in federal court in Pittsburgh on October 29, 2018, and was ordered held without bail pending trial.[93] Two days later, Bowers was indicted on 44 counts by a federal grand jury. The charges carry a maximum penalty of death or 535 years in federal prison.[94] The counts included hate crimes,[95] 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence.[35][92][96][97] On November 1, 2018, Bowers entered a plea of not guilty.[98] On January 29, 2019, the grand jury indicted Bowers on an additional 19 counts, 13 of which were for hate crimes.[99] On February 11, 2019, Bowers was arraigned in federal court.[9] Bowers's defense team includes two public defenders plus well-known criminal defense attorney Judy Clarke, a death penalty expert who was appointed by the court as co-counsel for the defendant.[9][100] The defense offered a plea deal in which Bowers would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole; federal prosecutors declined, seeking the death penalty instead.[100][101][102] The trial date was not set until various pretrial motions were resolved.[102][103] In April 2020, Senior U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose denied a defense challenge to the federal death penalty.[100] In October 2020, Judge Ambrose denied a defense motion to dismiss charges brought under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and Church Arson Prevention Act.[100] In November 2021, the defense decided that it would not pursue an insanity defense or intellectual disability defense.[104] In January 2022, after holding an earlier evidentiary hearing, Judge Ambrose denied Bowers's motion to suppress evidence of statements he made after being arrested by police, inside an ambulance, and at the hospital the day of the attack.[105] After Judge Ambrose retired in February 2022, the case was randomly reassigned to U.S. District Judge Robert J. Colville.[106] In March 2022, Colville denied Bowers's motion for a change of venue.[107] Trial[edit] In September 2022, Judge Colville set the trial to begin in April 2023, rejecting a bid by the defense to delay the trial until December 2023.[108] In March 2023, members of the jury pool began completing questionnaires.[109] The jury selection process began on April 24 with twelve jurors and six alternates being selected.[110][111] The trial began May 30, 2023.[112][113] Prosecutors called sixty witnesses, while the defense did not call any witnesses.[114] The witnesses who testified included survivors of the attack, including congregants and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers.[114] Evidence presented to the jury included recordings of 9-1-1 calls as the attacks unfolded (including from some of the people killed), and testimony from police officers who ultimately subdued the gunman; from expert witnesses on medicine, guns, and computers; from the FBI agents and police detectives who investigated the case; from a paramedic who responded to the scene; and from the director of the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office.[114][115] Photographs were also introduced as evidence,[114] including photos of exhaustively documented bloodstains, bullet fragments, and shell casings, and police body-worn camera footage was also shown to the jury.[115] Bowers's antisemitic social media posts were also introduced as evidence.[116] After 11 days of testimony, prosecutors told the jury in closing argument that Bowers had made \"cold, calculated, deliberate choices\" in the shooting.[116] Bowers's defense counsel conceded that he had fatally shot all the victims, but argued that there was doubt as to his specific intent: \"why he did what he did and what he thought he would accomplish by doing so.\"[116] On June 16, 2023, 50-year-old Bowers was found guilty on all 63 federal charges, including 11 counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; the jury rendered its verdict after five hours of deliberation over two days.[117] Sentencing phase[edit] The sentencing phase began on June 16, 2023, with the jury hearing arguments to decide if Bowers should be sentenced to death or life without parole. Bowers' defense lawyers sought to persuade the jury that Bowers had significant brain damage[118] and was influenced by mental illness or delusions.[119][120] By contrast, prosecutors emphasized evidence showing that Bowers had extensively planned his attack and was motivated by antisemitism,[118][119] as shown in his numerous rants on social media and statements to police after the attack.[120] Three University of Pittsburgh Medical Center physicians (two radiologists and a neurologist) testified about their review of brain-imaging tests (an EEG, PET, and MRI) of Bowers in 2021 and 2022.[118] They found the tests to be largely normal.[118][120] Two defense experts, by contrast, testified that they believed Bowers \"had significant brain damage that could be correlated with schizophrenia\" and could affect behavior.[118] A separate defense expert, a University of North Texas forensic psychologist, testified on his opinions from 20 hours of examination of Bowers over four days in 2022. He testified that Bowers was \"proud\" of his attack, showed no remorse for the shooting, and thought that he deserved medals and a parade.[119] The psychologist opined that Bowers is \"blatantly psychotic\" and suffers from schizophrenia, but agreed on cross-examination that he was \"goal-oriented\" and planned the attack as much as six months in advance.[119] Separately, a neurologist who examined Bowers in 2021 testified as a defense expert, opining that Bowers had schizophrenia and epilepsy.[120] On cross-examination, the defense neurologist acknowledged that Bowers was not \"incapable\" of plotting the shootings, but testified that \"his reasons for planning it out are unreliable in his brain.\"[120] The defense presented evidence of Bowers's lengthy history of serious mental illness, including multiple suicide attempts since his teenage years, an incident in which he \"threw flammable liquid on his mother and tried to ignite it\" at age thirteen, and three instances of involuntary commitment, the latest in 2004.[120] At the request of the defense, the sentencing phase was split into two parts (each with its own opening statements, closing arguments and jury decision): (1) whether Bowers was eligible to be sentenced to death and (2) the selection of the sentence. On July 13, 2023, after two hours of deliberation, the jury found that Bowers was eligible for a death sentence.[121] After making further deliberation on sentence for two days, the federal jury issued a unanimous decision to sentence Bowers to the death penalty on August 2.[122] Bowers was the first and only criminal to be sentenced to death by the US federal government during the presidency of Joe Biden.[123][124] On August 3, 2023, Bowers was formally sentenced to death.[125] Imprisonment[edit] On August 26, 2023, Bowers was transferred to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and placed on death row at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute.[126] Bowers attempted to appeal his sentence for a new trial in November 2023,[127] but his request was denied in May 2024.[128] In December 2024, when President Joe Biden announced commutations for the death sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, he excluded Bowers along with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who perpetrated the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and Dylann Roof, who committed the 2015 Charleston church shooting, because of their convictions for either terrorism or hate-motivated mass murder related crimes.[129] State criminal proceedings[edit] Bowers was also charged with 36 state criminal counts, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, six counts of attempted criminal homicide, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.[36] The state charges were held in abeyance pending the federal trial.[95] Reactions[edit] United States[edit] National[edit] Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf makes a statement about the shooting. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto stands listening in the striped tie. President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, then-Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, and Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O'Connor released statements about the incident through Twitter. Trump called the shooting a wicked, antisemitic act of \"pure evil.\"[55] He also opined that the shooting was preventable: \"If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him\".[130][131][132] Trump suggested cases such as this call for the death penalty.[132] Cecilia Wang of the American Civil Liberties Union said the attack, along with other recent unrest, was inspired by elements of Trump's rhetoric.[133] Vice President Mike Pence denied any such connection in an NBC News interview that night.[134][135] Over 2,000 people, including many from the local Jewish community, protested against Trump's visit to the synagogue site, chanting \"words have meaning\", and carrying signs with such slogans as \"We build bridges, not walls\".[136] From October 27 to 31, all U.S. flags on public and military grounds were flown at half-staff in memory of the victims.[137] On the Friday following the shooting, David Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ran the opening of the Hebrew-Aramaic kaddish, often called the Jewish mourner's prayer, as a full-width front-page headline.[138] Jewish security[edit] The aftermath of the shooting included arguably the most ambitious and comprehensive effort ever taken to protect Jewish life in the United States, according to the New York Times. In addition to bringing in $100 million in federal grants through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NGSP), the Jewish Federations of North America raised $62 million to secure every Jewish community in North America, overseen by the Secure Community Network. By 2023, 93 Jewish federations had full-time security directors, a more than four-fold increase over the previous 5 years.[139] The next year, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 83 of 2019 to establish the state's Nonprofit Security Grant Fund, a state-level version of the NGSP. Initially, $5 million in grant funding was available. After an increase in antisemitism during the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, the General Assembly increased the available funding to $10 million.[140] In the 5 years since its inception, the fund distributed $25 million to synagogues, mosques, and other nonprofit organizations.[141] Local[edit] Carnegie Mellon University lowered the American flag to half-staff to mourn the victims. People gathered again at the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenues in front of the Sixth Presbyterian Church on October 30. On the same day, Trump visited Pittsburgh in response to the shooting incident.[142] Immediately after the shooting, the campus of Carnegie Mellon University was placed on lockdown and all university-sponsored activities were cancelled for the day.[24] At the same time residents were advised by police to remain in their homes and stay off the streets.[53] An unusually large proportion of the Pittsburgh Jewish community from all denominations participated in local Jewish rituals related to death and mourning. Jewish tradition requires a person to guard a corpse until it is buried. Shomrim (volunteer guards) took one-hour shifts at the Pittsburgh morgue until the bodies were moved to funeral homes. The Atlantic reported that \"most of the volunteers appeared to be Orthodox, but they felt strong solidarity with the liberal communities that were directly affected by the shooting.\"[143] Members of the Pittsburgh Steelers attended the joint funeral service for the Rosenthal brothers on Tuesday, October 30, when NFL teams are traditionally off. The brothers, who were intellectually disabled, had a sister who is a former employee of the team.[144] During the long wait for a trial, members of the Pittsburgh congregations received interfaith support and solidarity from black church and American Sikh communities targeted by violent hatred,[145] including members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina (targeted by a shooting attack in 2015)[145] and the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin that had been targeted in a shooting attack in 2012.[146] International[edit] The Eiffel Tower in Paris darkened its lights in tribute to the victims of the shooting.[147] Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the \"horrifying antisemitic brutality\", adding \"the whole of Israel grieves with the families of the dead.\"[148] Israel's education and diaspora affairs minister, Naftali Bennett, immediately left for Pittsburgh to visit the synagogue, meet with community members, and participate in the funerals of the victims,[149] and directed the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs \"to assess and prepare to assist the Pittsburgh Jewish community, 'including the need for emergency and resilience teams that immediately left Israel for psychological assistance and community rehabilitation.'\"[150][151][152] Israel's cabinet stood for a moment's silence on October 28 to honor the victims.[153] Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel David Lau said \"any murder of any Jew in any part of the world for being Jewish is unforgivable\".[154] He described the location as \"a place with a profound Jewish flavor\". Many news reports said he refused to refer to the Conservative congregation as a \"synagogue\" since it is non-Orthodox.[155] Prominent non-Orthodox Israeli religious leaders and scholars rejected his statement.[156][157][158] Tel Aviv Municipality lit the city hall building with the colors of the American flag in solidarity with the victims of the Pittsburgh attack.[159][160] An image of the Israeli flag next to the American flag was projected onto Jerusalem's Western Wall.[161] Pope Francis denounced the \"inhuman act of violence\" in his Sunday prayers in St. Peter's Square on October 28, and led prayers for the dead and wounded, as well as their families. He asked God \"to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies\".[162] Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims of the shooting, and said \"Extremism and terrorism know no race or religion, and must be condemned in all cases\".[163] Hamas offered condolences and condemned the attack, noting that they could relate as being \"victims of Israeli terror\". Hamas had previously expressed support for shootings at synagogues in Israel.[164][165] Jan Kickert, Austrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said: \"The attack ... was an attack on all of us, on what we stand for – religious liberty, human rights. We are committed to the safety and security of Jews wherever they are. I say this with growing up and living with the shame that my forefathers were among the worst perpetrators in Nazi times.\"[166] Media and organizations[edit] Many local businesses on Murray Avenue put up posters in support of the victims. The New York Times published an op-ed by Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, that urged readers to fight against antisemitism and hate.[167] A CNN editorial described the shooting as one of three hate-incited acts that took place in the United States in the same week, along with a series of mail bombing attempts and a shooting at a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown, Kentucky.[168] On October 28, the Empire State Building darkened its lights in honor of the victims. According to the building's Twitter account, the top of the spire was left aglow with \"an orange halo shining a light on gun violence awareness\".[169] In the wake of the shooting, the University of Pittsburgh darkened its traditional Victory Lights atop of the Cathedral of Learning,[170] and on November 2, the university altered the Victory Lights so the blue beam would shine for 11 seconds, one second for each fatality.[171] Sports[edit] Sports teams that observed a moment of silence for the shooting victims included the Pittsburgh Steelers at their home game against the Cleveland Browns,[172] the New Orleans Saints at the Minnesota Vikings,[173] the Pittsburgh Penguins at the Vancouver Canucks,[174] the Winnipeg Jets at the Toronto Maple Leafs,[175] the Philadelphia Eagles and the Jacksonville Jaguars playing in London,[176] and the Pittsburgh Panthers hosting Duke at Heinz Field.[177] A moment of silence was also observed before Game 4 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium on the night of October 27.[177] The Pittsburgh Penguins wore jerseys with a patch that read \"Stronger Than Hate\" for their game against the New York Islanders on October 30. The team announced that, following the game, the team would auction off the jerseys on behalf of the synagogue.[178] Similarly, the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team displayed a \"Stronger than Hate\" decal on their helmets during the November 2 game visiting the University of Virginia.[179] NFL player Terrell Suggs wore a Star of David on his cleats during a game in October 2019 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the shooting.[180] Vigils and rallies[edit] Pittsburgh locals crocheted or knit forms of the Star of David and hung them along Murray Avenue. On the evening of the shooting, over 3,000 people gathered at the intersection of Murray and Forbes avenues in Squirrel Hill for an interfaith candlelight vigil; it was organized by students from nearby Taylor Allderdice High School.[181] Two additional vigils were held in the neighborhood.[36] The day after the shooting, an interfaith vigil organized by the regional Jewish Federation was held at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, drawing an overflow crowd estimated at 2,500.[182] Attended by numerous national and local dignitaries, the event featured several speakers, including the rabbis of the three congregations that occupied the synagogue building, Islamic and Christian clergy, and civic leaders.[183] Among those in attendance were Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh; Rich Fitzgerald, Allegheny County executive; Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey; Governor Tom Wolf; Naftali Bennett, Israeli Minister for Education and Minister for Diaspora Affairs; Ron Dermer, Israeli ambassador to the United States; and Danny Danon, permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations. A video was streamed during the event featuring Israeli president Reuven Rivlin,[184] who offered brief remarks and led the crowd in a recitation of the Kaddish.[185][186] In the week following the attack, Jewish and interfaith communal vigils and solidarity rallies were held across the world.[187][188] In the United States, these were attended by hundreds or thousands of people,[189] in many cities across the nation.[d] In Canada, they were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Halifax, Vancouver and other places. In Israel, approximately 500 Americans and Israelis lit candles on the night of October 28 at Zion Square in Jerusalem.[188] In Europe, Jewish communal vigils were held in London, Liverpool, Brighton, and Paris.[197][198] College students at more than one hundred campuses across the country held vigils in the days following the shootings in memory of the victims.[199] The American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Federations of North America called for both Jews and non-Jews to attend synagogue services on the Shabbat following the attack, under the hashtag #ShowUpForShabbat. NBC News reported thousands of people around the world attended services in local synagogues, community centers, and college campuses, including Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.[200] Additionally, many congregations recited the prayer for martyrs Av HaRachamim even though it would normally be omitted that Shabbat.[201][202] As of 2024, the massacre is still being commemorated.[203] Presidential visit[edit] US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania disembark Air Force One at Pittsburgh International Airport On October 30, Trump flew to Pittsburgh on Air Force One, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They went to the synagogue, where they met with Tree of Life spiritual leader Jeffrey Myers and Israeli ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Trump lit candles for the victims inside and outside placed stones on each of the 11 Star-of-David markers of the memorial. The group went to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, where Trump spoke with wounded victims, their families, law enforcement officials, and medical staff.[142] Trump's visit was discouraged by some in the Pittsburgh community. Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto said Trump should not have come, as the wounds were raw and the community was just beginning to mourn and hold funerals.[204] Peduto, with agreement from Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald, also urged Trump to consider \"the wills of the families\" of the deceased.[205] More than 70,000 people had signed an open letter written by Bend the Arc: Pittsburgh saying that Trump was not welcome until he \"fully denounces white nationalism\".[206] One of the survivors, Dan Leger, refused to meet Trump in the hospital and later wrote a critical op-ed for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.[207] Former Tree of Life president Lynette Lederman opposed Trump's visit, saying she felt his words were \"hypocritical\" and that \"We have people who stand by us who believe in values, not just Jewish values, but believe in values, and those are not the values of this president, and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\".[208][209][210] Before Trump's visit, Tree of Life rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, \"There is hate, and it isn't going away. It just seems to be getting worse. ... We've got to stop hate, and it can't just be to say we need to stop hate. We need to do, we need to act to tone down rhetoric,\" adding that he would welcome a visit from Trump.[208]Aaron Bisno, the rabbi of Rodef Shalom Congregation, said he did not think Trump's presence was beneficial, saying that Trump had become a \"symbol of division\" for many.[211] During Trump's visit to the synagogue, an estimated 2,000 protesters were cordoned off a few blocks away.[212] Afterward, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, \"The President was very warm, very consoling.\"[213] Neo-Nazis and white supremacists[edit] Among American neo-Nazis and white supremacists, figures such as Richard B. Spencer, Andrew Anglin, and Matthew Heimbach expressed fear that the backlash over the attack could derail their efforts to gain mainstream political acceptance.[214] 4chan users on the /pol/ board viewed the attack as \"accidentally redpilling\" people and denied that it had occurred. They claimed the purported attack was a \"false flag\" committed by Jews to gain sympathy. Some users on Gab praised the shooting and created the hashtag #HeroRobertBowers to express support for the shooter.[214][215][216] On August 10, 2023, Hardy Carroll Lloyd, a man from Follansbee, West Virginia, was arrested for allegedly making threats towards the jurors and witnesses in Bowers's federal trial on social media and in emails and online comments. According to prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia, Lloyd was a \"self-proclaimed 'reverend' of a White supremacy movement\". He also allegedly expressed support for Bowers and the shooting and had encouraged similar attacks.[217][218] Lloyd was charged with \"obstruction of the due administration of justice, transmitting threats in interstate and foreign commerce and witness tampering.\"[219] On September 19, 2023, he pleaded guilty and is expected to face more than six years in prison.[218] Fundraising efforts[edit] Numerous fundraising efforts were launched in order to assist the survivors of the shooting, pay for the burial of the victims, and pay for the repairs to the synagogue.[220] As of November 1, a GoFundMe campaign which was initiated by an Iranian graduate student in Washington, D.C., had exceeded US$1 million in donations,[221] and a new goal of US$1.2 million has also been surpassed. Muslim groups opened a LaunchGood crowdfunding campaign to help pay for the burial of the victims and survivors' medical bills, with the funds to be distributed by the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh.[222][223] As of November 1, that campaign had exceeded its goal of $150,000 with more than $225,000 in contributions.[221] The organizers of the campaign announced that all excess funds would be \"spent on projects that help foster Muslim-Jewish collaboration, dialogue, and solidarity\".[224] The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh raised $3.65 million for victims by November 13;[225] donations to that organization were to be matched by the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh Foundation.[220][221] Fundraising campaigns for shooting victims in the Dor Hadash and New Light congregations raised nearly $23,000 combined.[226] A $6.3 million fund was raised for the survivors of the shooting, the families of the 11 dead, and police officers.[227] Documentary[edit] In 2022, A Tree of Life: The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting documentary was released by HBO Documentary Films.[228][229] See also[edit] Crime portalJudaism portalPittsburgh portal Poway synagogue shooting, Occurred six months later and inspired by Bowers Alt-right#Violent incidents Antisemitism in the United States in the 21st century Far-right politics#United States Geography of antisemitism#United States History of the Jews in Pennsylvania List of attacks on Jewish institutions in the United States List of death row inmates in the United States List of synagogue shootings Racism in the United States#Jewish Americans Right-wing terrorism Notes[edit] ^ Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death (11 counts) Hate crimes resulting in death (11 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury (2 counts) Hate crimes involving an attempt to kill (2 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon, and resulting in bodily injury to public safety officers (8 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury to public safety officers (4 counts) Discharge of a firearm during these crimes of violence (25 counts)[4] ^ Hebrew: עֵץ חַיִּים – אוֹר לְשִׂמְחָה[6] ^ Hebrew: דוֹר חָדָשׁ ^ These included Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Buffalo, Charleston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, Houston, Jacksonville, Knoxville, Los Angeles, Madison, Memphis, Middletown, New Haven, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Portland, Rochester, Salt Lake City, Seattle, St. Louis, Washington, Wilkes-Barre and Woodbridge.[188][190][191][192][193][194][195][196] References[edit] ^ Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting Called Domestic Terrorism Archived March 27, 2019, at the Wayback Machine, New Hampshire Public Radio ^ a b \"What we know about Robert Bowers, suspect in mass shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue\".

It consists of an ordinary flush toilet with no surrounding walls. Most of these toilets are paired with a crude basement shower apparatus and large sink, which often doubles as a laundry room. Origin[edit] The most popular explanation for the Pittsburgh toilet is related to Pittsburgh's status as a major industrial city in the 20th century. According to this explanation, toilets such as these were said to be used by steelworkers and miners who, grimy from the day's labor, could use an exterior door to enter the basement directly from outside and use the basement's shower and toilet before heading upstairs.[1][2][3] Alternatively, they may have served to prevent sewage backups from flooding the living areas of homes. As sewage backups tend to flood the lowest fixture in a residence, a Pittsburgh toilet would be the fixture to overflow, containing the sewage leak in the basement.[4] A Pittsburgh-style toilet in the basement of a home in Cleveland, OH References[edit] ^ Kirkland, Kevin (May 22, 2004). \"Homes & real estate: For house hunters, old and new homes each have their advantages\".

No, we're not talking about the Pittsburgh toilet, the ubiquitous basement fixture that harkens back to the heyday of the steel mills and coal mines. Not usually a big selling point, it nevertheless provides a good starting point for a basement powder room. ^ Billingsly, Sarah (September 24, 2003). \"Eclectic Pittsburgh Architecture reflects Industrial Influence\".

History[edit] Until 2016, Pittsburgh was one of the few mid-sized metropolitan areas in the U.S. with two major daily papers; both the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review have histories of breaking in-depth investigative news stories on a national scale. In 2016, the Tribune-Review moved to an all-digital format. The Post-Gazette moved to publishing five print editions a week in 2018, three print editions a week in 2019, and two print editions a week in 2021. The alternative papers in the region include the Pittsburgh City Paper, the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle, The New People, which is published weekly by the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice, the New Pittsburgh Courier, which is one of the larger ethnic publications in the region, and Zajedničar, the only Croatian-language newspaper that is currently published in the United States. The Pitt News, a financially independent, student-produced newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh, has operated for roughly a century. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law also hosts JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service.

However, as of early 2006 the station is no longer No. 1 in the ratings. KQV 1410 AM, now an all-news outlet, was Pittsburgh's dominant Top 40 station throughout the 1960s. On the FM dial, album-rock WDVE (102.5 DVE), modern rock WXDX (105.9 The X), adult contemporary WBZZ (Star 100.7), pop and hip-hop WKST-FM (96.1 KissFM) and Pittsburgh Sports Talk on (93.7 The Fan) KDKA-FM FM talk radio is available in the Pittsburgh market at WPGB (104.7 FM NewsTalk). Pittsburgh is also home to three public radio stations: WESA, the local NPR station; WQED-FM, a listener-supported commercial-free classical music station; and WYEP 91.3FM, the nation's third-largest independent \"adult album alternative\" (AAA) station, which hosts the locally produced environmental radio show The Allegheny Front and also carries some NPR programming. The Radio Information Service, broadcasting on a subcarrier of WESA provides special programming for the blind and print impaired. Additionally, Pittsburgh hosts the non-commercial radio stations WRCT (affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University) and WPTS (affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh).

DMA[edit] See also: Pittsburgh Media Market In 2010, Nielsen will continue to rank Pittsburgh as the 23rd largest television Designated Market Area (DMA) in the country, with 1,154,950 households. That is a drop from Nielsen's 2009 estimate of 1,156,460. Despite the decline in households, Pittsburgh still has 22,090 more households than the next closest television DMA which is Charlotte, NC.[20] [21] In 2004 Pittsburgh was the 24th largest DMA in the U.S. as ranked by population, with a population of 2,881,200.[22] Pittsburgh's DMA covers a land area of 10,083 square miles (26,110 km2) in three states. Other definitions of the \"Pittsburgh region\" extend into Ohio border counties with some sources including several Ohio counties and as far south & west as the Kentucky border and north into the extreme southwest of New York State.

Major nicknames[edit] \"The City of Bridges\" City of Bridges Pittsburgh boasts more bridges, owing to its location at the confluence of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela, than any other city or region in the world.[1] Steel City Pittsburgh and the surrounding area was once one of the largest steel producers in the world, gaining it international renown as such. The U.S. Steel Tower remains the headquarters for that company. Dirty 'Burgh Pittsburgh and the surrounding area was once one of the largest producers of steel in the world. It was said that due to the pollution caused by the steel industry, you would leave for work in a white shirt and come home in an all black one. The 'Burgh Unlike many cities in America that end in burg (including the capital of the state, Harrisburg), Pittsburgh retains the h at the end of its name, making this quality recognizable as unique to the city. City of Champions[2][3][4][5] Pittsburgh has enjoyed numerous sports championships from its three major league sports teams and the athletic programs at its many universities. Hell with the Lid Off[6] Boston writer James Parton described Pittsburgh as \"hell with the lid off\" in 1868. This was because of the smoke, smog, and fire that were prevalent during the city's steelmaking heyday. Minor nicknames[edit] Iron City[7] The Pit Derived from the name of the city and university, as well as the fact that downtown Pittsburgh is in a \"hole\" due to the hilly topography of the surrounding neighborhoods. Paris of Appalachia[8] Pittsburgh is the largest metropolitan area in the entire Appalachian region. Sixburgh [citation needed] This is a reference to the six Super Bowls that the Pittsburgh Steelers won. The 412 412 is the telephone area code for much of Allegheny County, though it covered much more geographically at the time the name was coined, prior to the introduction of 724. Both 412 and 724 are now part of an overlay complex in which the entire region served by those codes is also covered by 878. The Only City with an Entrance[9] Traveling through the Fort Pitt Tunnel or Liberty Tunnels under Mount Washington yields, for many travelers, the first glimpse of the city's skyline. Capital of/Largest City in West Virginia So called because many West Virginians migrate to Pittsburgh. Benigno Numine Comes from the city's Latin motto. It is generally translated as \"With the Benevolent Deity\"[10] or \"By the Favour of Heaven\".[11] See also[edit] List of city nicknames in Pennsylvania Name of Pittsburgh Nicknames of Philadelphia Nicknames of Cleveland References[edit] Wikiquote has quotations related to Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh, the region's core city, has a population of 302,971, the second-largest in the state after Philadelphia. Over half of the region's population resides within Allegheny County, which has a population of 1.24 million and is the state's second-largest county after Philadelphia County.[6] Definitions[edit] Historical population CensusPop.Note%± 185013,829—1860178,8311,193.2%1870262,20446.6%1880355,86935.7%1890664,77886.8%19001,083,84663.0%19101,471,80035.8%19201,759,98919.6%19302,023,26915.0%19402,062,5561.9%19502,213,2367.3%19602,768,93825.1%19702,759,443−0.3%19802,648,991−4.0%19902,468,289−6.8%20002,431,087−1.5%20102,356,285−3.1%20202,370,9300.6%U.S. Decennial Census[7]1790–1960[8] 1900–1990[9]1990–2000[10][1] Garrett Nelson and Alasdair Rae's 2016 analysis of American commuter flows, \"An Economic Geography of the United States: From Commutes to Megaregions\", identified the Pittsburgh megaregion as a region encompassing the entirety or significant portions of 54 counties in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, Northern West Virginia, and Western Maryland.[11] By this definition, the informal regional boundaries are similar to historical interpretations where the region is defined as the central portion of the Allegheny Plateau to the west and north of the Allegheny Front and south of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania's Northern Tier.[12] The hills and river valleys along the Upper Ohio River and its many eastern tributaries, including the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers have historically been the major centers of population of the region.[12] According to this research the US can be divided into 'mega regions' based on the most extreme commuting patterns within a geographical area (commutes within 100 miles from the core city). By this liberal definition, the Pittsburgh mega region consists of twenty-eight Pennsylvania counties (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Fayette, Forest, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Lawrence, Mercer, Mifflin, Somerset, Venango, Warren, Washington, and Westmoreland), nineteen West Virginia counties (Barbour, Brooke, Doddridge, Grant, Hancock, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, Marshall, Mineral, Monongalia, Ohio, Preston, Randolph, Taylor, Tucker, Tyler, Upshur, and Wetzel), five Ohio counties (Belmont, Columbiana, Harrison, Jefferson, and Monroe), and two Maryland counties (Allegany and Garrett), and portions of Chautauqua, New York in and around Ripley.[11] The combined population of the megaregion was over 4.9 million in 2016.[13] Border of Pittsburgh Megaregion showing included counties[14] There are also several formal definitions of Greater Pittsburgh which are often used in media mentions of the region. These include the Office of Management and Budget's Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV Combined Statistical Area (CSA).[15] The Nielsen Corporation's Pittsburgh Designated Market Area (DMA) is another commonly used formal definition of the region.[16] There are nineteen counties included in at least one of these definitions and their combined population was over 2.9 million in 2016.[13] Greater Pittsburgh Counties by Formal Definitions County State Formal Definition Population (2016)[13] MSA CSA DMA Allegheny PA 1,225,365 Armstrong PA 66,486 Beaver PA 167,429 Brooke WV 22,977 Butler PA 186,847 Clarion PA 38,513 Fayette PA 132,733 Forest PA 7,321 Garrett MD 29,425 Greene PA 37,197 Hancock WV 29,590 Indiana PA 86,364 Jefferson OH 66,704 Lawrence PA 87,294 Mercer PA 109,972 Monongalia WV 104,622 Preston WV 33,758 Venango PA 52,582 Washington PA 207,981 Westmoreland PA 355,458 Total Population 2,938,646 Economy[edit] Historically, Pittsburgh has been grouped in the \"Rust Belt\";[17] however, reflective of the rebound of the region within the last generation, the metro area has been included as a part of the \"Great Lakes Basin\" gaining representation in the Great Lakes Metro Chamber Coalition.[18][19] Pittsburgh's association with the Great Lakes region is due in part to its economic, demographic and commuter connections to Great Lakes cities like Cleveland, Erie, Toledo and even Detroit.[20] Christopher Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's University Center for Social and Urban Research, has argued that southwestern Pennsylvania is \"far more interconnected\" with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as Youngstown, Akron, and Cleveland, not to Pennsylvanian cities such as Allentown, Scranton, or Philadelphia.[21] He notes that, conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of Columbus. Briem argues that \"In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map.\"[21] In recognizing their economic interdependence, Briem coined the term \"Cleveburgh\" to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of I-76 between the cities.[21][22][23] Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an interconnected \"megapolitan area\" and refer to it as the \"Steel Corridor\".[24] Education[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(July 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The campus of the University of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh The largest school district in the area is the Pittsburgh Public Schools, with the school districts of Allegheny County also boasting large student bodies. Many private schools also serve the core county of Allegheny. More public districts are found throughout Beaver, Westmoreland, and Washington counties, and private schools in each county. Several area colleges and universities serve the region. Pittsburgh itself is home to many colleges, universities, and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University. Also in the city are Carlow University, Chatham University, Point Park University, the Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science. Within the greater metropolitan area, universities include Clarion University of Pennsylvania, La Roche University, Slippery Rock University, Westminster College and Grove City College north of the city, Robert Morris University and Geneva College west of the city, Washington & Jefferson College, Pennsylvania Western University and Waynesburg University to the south, and Seton Hill University, Saint Vincent College, Westmoreland County Community College and Indiana University of Pennsylvania to the east. Transportation[edit] Airports[edit] Pittsburgh International Airport's Landside Terminal Pittsburgh International Airport is located 17 mi (27 km) to the west of downtown Pittsburgh in Findlay.[25] The smaller but less crowded Arnold Palmer Regional Airport to the east of downtown in Latrobe provides commercial service to the metro area. Pittsburgh International was the fortress hub of US Airways from 1952 to 2005 with over 500 daily departures to more than 110 destinations in 2000. By 2007, fewer than 70 departures to 21 destinations remained.[26] In 2007, US Airways did select the airport for its new $25 million, 27,000 sq ft (2,500 m2), 600-employees-strong Global Flight Operations Center. Since being de-hubbed the airport has seen expanded service from JetBlue, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines' direct trans-Atlantic service to Paris. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport offers commercial service via Spirit Airlines to Florida and South Carolina. Palmer has had commercially scheduled air service since the 1980s. Allegheny County Airport in suburban West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, is the area's largest general aviation airport. The historic landmark, art deco terminal was the main passenger airport for the area until 1952. Allegheny opened in 1931 as the nation's third-largest and first with \"hard surface\" runways. Smaller suburban airports serve as private plane and corporate jet bases include: North Metro: Butler County Airport Zelienople Municipal Airport Rock Airport New Castle Municipal Airport Lakehill Airport Grove City Airport South Metro: Allegheny County Airport Rostraver Airport Joseph A. Hardy Connellsville Airport Washington County Airport East Metro: Pittsburgh-Monroeville Airport Greensburg Jeannette Regional Airport Indiana County-Jimmy Stewart Airport Arnold Palmer Regional Airport West Metro: Beaver County Airport Eddie Dew Memorial Airpark (Ohio) Jefferson County Airpark (Ohio) Herron Airport (West Virginia) Wheeling Airport (West Virginia) Interstates[edit] The Pittsburgh area is served by four main-line Interstates including the Pennsylvania Turnpike (which is co-signed with I-76 and in the extreme eastern part of the region also co-signed with I-70): I-70 I-76 / Penna Turnpike I-79 I-80 It's also served by several Interstate spur routes: I-376 I-576 (future) I-279 I-579 Other expressways[edit] US 22 serving west area commuters from Steubenville, Ohio, through West Virginia and into the metro area of Washington County, Pennsylvania, and into Allegheny merging into I-376. US 30 in the Greensburg area and co-signed with I-376 through the city and western suburbs. US 119 US 422 SR 7 along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Ohio. PA 28 serving the Allegheny Valley commuters in the Northeast and through suburban Armstrong County. PA Turnpike 43 (Mon–Fayette Expressway) a 70 mile long interstate grade route between the south hills and West Virginia. PA 65 serving commuters along the Ohio River valley to the northwest of the city. PA Turnpike 66 (Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass) as a partial east hills beltway for traffic from both Interstate 70 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 76. Fort Duquesne Boulevard serving as a downtown expressway between I-279 and I-579. Port[edit] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo in 2011. It is the 9th-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[27] Mass transit[edit] Pittsburgh Regional Transit light rail train at Washington Junction station in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania in March 2005 The Pittsburgh Regional Transit agency (PRT) is the largest mass transit service in the metro area and includes a 26-mile subway/light rail system, all serving the central core. This system is complemented by the Butler Transit Authority and Town & Country Transit to north destinations, Beaver County Transit Authority and New Castle Area Transit Authority to northwest destinations, Westmoreland County Transit Authority and IndiGo to eastern destinations, and Washington City Transit, Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority and Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation serving southern destinations. The University of Pittsburgh Transportation System also provides services in the eastern core of the metropolitan area while Mountain Line Transit serves the city, western suburbs and an express route south to Morgantown, West Virginia. A metro map of all fixed route transit routes for Pennsylvania counties can be found here.[28] Rail[edit] Amtrak serves the region with stops at Penn Station in Downtown Pittsburgh, Connellsville to the southeast and both Greensburg and Latrobe to the east. Freight rail is a major industry for the area with the Pittsburgh Line and the Conway Yard among other infrastructure serving the region. Interstate bus[edit] Both the Greyhound Lines and Megabus serve the area. Recreation and rail trails[edit] Deckers Creek Trail Great Allegheny Passage Mon River Trail Montour Trail Ohio River Trail Ohio River Water Trail Panhandle Trail Stavich Bike Trail Three Rivers Heritage Trail West Penn Trail Western Maryland Rail Trail Westmoreland Heritage Trail Wheeling Heritage Trails Culture[edit] Pittsburgh and its surrounding area has a distinct regional identity and has historically been regarded as a transitional region within the Northeastern United States. The region's counties also fall within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission.[29] The City of Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia\"[30]: which makes it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia which has traditionally been characterized as southern, rural, and economically distressed.[30] Joseph Scarpaci, professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech,[31] has described Pittsburgh as having \"one foot in the East...and the other in the Midwest\".[30] Barbara Johnstone, professor of rhetoric and linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University, ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the Allegheny Mountains and the Allegheny Plateau.The Pittsburgh area was sort of isolated. It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains. There's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itself—not really southern, not really Midwestern, not really part of Pennsylvania. People just didn't move very much.[32]In his 2009 book, The Paris of Appalachia, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is intentionally provocative:\"The Paris of Appalachia\" some have called Pittsburgh derisively, because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace that title, though few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover, but were we called \"The Paris of the Rockies,\" we wouldn't run from it. Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid to say who we are. This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's just Pittsburgh, and there's no place like it. That's both its blessing and its curse.[33] Arts[edit] Visual arts[edit] Greater Pittsburgh is home to several museums, galleries, and organizations which promote appreciation for the visual arts. The largest art museum in the region is the Carnegie Museum of Art, founded in 1895 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie and located in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood. It is renowned for its collections of 19th and 20th century decorative art, Japanese prints, and old master prints.[34] Contemporary art museums include the Mattress Factory and the Andy Warhol Museum, both located on Pittsburgh's North Side.[35][36] Other regional visual arts museums include:[37][38] Frick Art and Historical Center (Point Breeze, Pittsburgh) Contemporary Craft (Strip District, Pittsburgh) ToonSeum (Downtown, Pittsburgh) Westmoreland Museum of American Art (Greensburg) Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art (Multiple locations - Loretto, Ligonier Valley, Johnstown, and Altoona)[39] The Maridon Museum (Butler) University Museum at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (Indiana) Hoyt Institute of Fine Arts (New Castle) Venango Museum of Art, Science, and Industry (Oil City) Palmer Museum of Art (University Park) Erie Art Museum (Erie) Juniata College Museum of Art (Huntingdon) Art Museum of West Virginia University (Morgantown) Sports and recreation[edit] Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh PNC Park in the North Shore neighborhood, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team since 2001 The Pittsburgh area served as a launchpad for the professionalization of both American football and ice hockey in the 1890s and 1900s. The first professional player (William Heffelfinger) played for a Pittsburgh football team in 1892, which was followed by the first open professional (John Brallier), the first all-professional team (the Latrobe Athletic Association), and a participant in the first all-professional league (the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League). In the case of ice hockey, the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the first hockey league to pay its players in 1901, eventually merging into the first fully pro league, the International Professional Hockey League, in 1904. Professional hockey in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada (where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century) by four years. Today, the region is home to three major league franchises in baseball, football, and hockey; several minor league teams in soccer, baseball, and hockey; and three major NCAA universities.

Area courses have also hosted multiple PGA Championships, LPGA Championships, U.S. Women's Opens and Ryder Cup matches. Annual sports events[edit] Annual sporting events include the Head of the Ohio crew race, Three Rivers Regatta, Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, and the Pittsburgh Marathon. The regions rivers have hosted the Bassmaster Classic and Forrest Wood Cup and the city has enjoyed having one of only two teams to host the Major League Baseball All Star Game a record eight times. The area has also hosted the NHL All Star Game, NHL Winter Classic, Senior Olympics, NHL Entry Draft, AHL All Star Game, NCAA Tournament and Frozen Four. Winter in the region sees sport continue at such rinks at PPG Place and North Park as well as area ski resorts like Boyce Park, Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden Valley, Laurel Mountain and Wisp.

The statistical area was officially defined by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2013 and revised in 2023.[2] The estimated population of the area was 2,635,228 in mid-2016.[3] Boundaries[edit] Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, seen here at night in November 2015, is the largest city in the Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area The following metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas form the Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville, PA–OH–WV combined statistical area.[2] Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area[edit] Further information: Pittsburgh metropolitan area Allegheny County, PA Armstrong County, PA Beaver County, PA Butler County, PA Lawrence County, PA Fayette County, PA Washington County, PA Westmoreland County, PA Weirton–Steubenville, WV–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area[edit] Further information: Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area Brooke County, WV Hancock County, WV Jefferson County, OH Hermitage, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area[edit] Mercer County, PA Indiana, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area[edit] Indiana County, PA Principal cities and towns[edit] Largest municipalities by population (Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville, PA–OH–WV CSA)[4] Rank Name Type County State Population(2018–21) 1 Pittsburgh City Allegheny PA 302,971 2 Hempfield Township Westmoreland PA 41,664 3 Penn Hills Township Allegheny PA 40,974 4 Mount Lebanon Township Allegheny PA 34,075 5 Bethel Park Borough Allegheny PA 33,577 6 Cranberry Township Butler PA 33,096 7 North Huntingdon Township Westmoreland PA 31,757 8 Ross Township Allegheny PA 30,487 9 McCandless Township Allegheny PA 29,322 10 Monroeville Municipality Allegheny PA 28,640 11 Shaler Township Allegheny PA 27,963 12 Plum Borough Allegheny PA 27,144 13 Moon Township Allegheny PA 26,956 14 Peters Township Washington PA 23,029 15 New Castle City Lawrence PA 21,926 16 Unity Township Westmoreland PA 21,599 17 Baldwin Borough Allegheny PA 21,510 18 Murrysville Municipality Westmoreland PA 21,006 19 Penn Township Westmoreland PA 20,346 20 Upper St. Clair Township Allegheny PA 19,685 21 West Mifflin Borough Allegheny PA 19,589 22 Weirton City Hancock & Brooke WV 18,813 23 Hampton Township Allegheny PA 18,273 24 Steubenville City Jefferson OH 18,161 25 McKeesport City Allegheny PA 17,727 Demographics[edit] Ethnic diversity[edit] A comparison of the White, non-Hispanic vs. non-white population in the Pittsburgh CSA vs. the entire U.S., based on 2020 and 2016 U.S. Census reports[5] Source: US Census Bureau, County Population by Characteristics: 2010–2016[6] Median household income by county subdivision in 2012-16[7] Median age by county in the area as of 2010-2016[6] Population by generation in the area in 2010–2016[6] Median household income by county in 2012-16[7] Median age by county in the area as of 2010-2016[6] According to the 2016 population estimates, Greater Pittsburgh is less diverse than the U.S. as a whole. Persons of color, or non-white Americans, represent only 13.5 percent of the region's population, compared to 38.7 percent in the United States overall.[5] The combined statistical area has, however, seen a significant increase in Asian Americans, Hispanic or Latino Americans, and Multiracial Americans since 2010. During the same period, the African-American population has remained essentially unchanged whereas the White population continues to steadily decrease.[5] Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is the most diverse of the twelve Pittsburgh CSA counties with persons of color representing 21 percent of the population, or 257,832 people. Armstrong County is the least diverse, with a population that is only 2.8 percent non-white.[5] Pittsburgh CSA population by ethnic group (2010–2016)[5] Ethnic group 2010 Census 2016 Estimate 2010–2016 Change Total % Total % Total % White or European American 2,338,582 87.89 2,280,228 86.53 −58,354 −2.50 Black or African American 206,106 7.75 206,035 7.82 −71 −0.03 Asian American 43,236 1.62 56,801 2.15 +13,565 +31.37 Multiracial 36,403 1.37 44,613 1.69 +8,210 +22.55 Hispanic or Latino 33,097 1.24 43,518 1.65 +10,421 +31.49 American Indian and Alaska Native 2,803 0.11 3,074 0.12 +271 +9.67 Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander 500 0.02 959 0.04 +459 +91.80 Total 2,660,727 100.0 2,635,228 100.0 −25,499 −0.96 Results from the past four U.S. presidential elections in Pittsburgh metropolitan area The 2012–2016 American Community Survey estimated the region's foreign-born population at 3.4 percent. The largest plurality of this group, or 48.3 percent, were born in Asia, 27.8 percent in Europe, and 13.3 percent in Latin America. A supermajority (67.3 percent) of the region's most recent international arrivals, or those entering the country since 2010, were born in Asia.[8] Age[edit] Pittsburgh CSA population by age group (2010–2016)[9] Age group 2010 census 2016 estimate 2010–2016 change Total % Total % Total % Under 18 years 535,961 20.14 504,285 19.14 −31,676 −5.91 18–64 years 1,663,500 62.52 1,624,450 61.64 −39,050 −2.35 65 years and over 461,266 17.34 506,493 19.22 +45,227 +9.80 Total 2,660,727 100.0 2,635,228 100.0 −25,499 −0.96 Greater Pittsburgh's population has traditionally been significantly older than the United States as a whole.[10] This is largely due to the large domestic out-migration which occurred during the steel industry's collapse in the 1970s and 1980s.[11] Most out-migrants were working age at the time and this led to the area having a much greater than average elderly population than most areas of the country at the end of the 20th century.[10] As of the 2012–2016 American Community Survey, Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton was the 11th oldest combined statistical area in the United States with a median age of 43 years.[12] Greater Pittsburgh's population age structure is most similar to slower growing European countries such as Belgium, Finland, Greece, and Slovenia which all have similar median ages.[13] In recent decades, however, the growth of the oldest segments of the population has become more pronounced in the country overall and less so in Greater Pittsburgh. Between 2010 and 2016, the age 65 and over population of the region increased 9.8 percent[9] whereas that age group grew by 22.3 percent in the United States over the same time period.[14] Indiana and Allegheny counties, which both have significant college student populations, are the youngest counties in the region by median age and Allegheny County's median age has actually been declining in recent years. All of the remaining ten counties in the region have median ages well above the US and their respective states.[6] Baby Boomers continue to represent the largest generational cohort in Greater Pittsburgh with 28.6 percent of the population in 2016.[6] Millennials, along with the youngest generation, Generation Z, now represent 40.9 percent of the region's population which is roughly equal to the oldest generations (Baby Boomers, Silents, and World War II) with 41.7 percent of the population. As is the case in the United States as a whole, Millennials are now the largest generation in Allegheny and Indiana counties.

Median income data is not available for the 2007–2011 ACS. † 2007–2011 figures are adjusted for inflation to compare to 2012–2016 ACS values in real terms.[17] The wealthiest counties by median household income in Greater Pittsburgh are Butler and Washington counties.[16] Both counties have median incomes above those of the United States and Pennsylvania and have continued to experience strong income growth since the Great Recession and have benefited from being adjacent to many of the wealthiest suburbs in Allegheny County's in North and South Hills. Most counties in the region and the City of Pittsburgh showed reasonably strong gains in household income since the 2007–2011 American Community Survey (ACS) whereas Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the nation as a whole saw income declines over the same time period.[15][16] This includes some of the less wealthy counties in the region, such as Fayette and Brooke counties. Despite this recent growth, however, the region's overall median household income remains slightly less than the United States overall.[16] According to the 2012–2016 ACS, there are 231 county subdivisions[18] whose median incomes are greater or equal to the region's median ($52,274).[7] The ten wealthiest districts are Sewickley Heights, Edgeworth, Ben Avon Heights, Fox Chapel, Sewickley Hills, Glen Osborne, Thornburg, Pine Township, Rosslyn Farms, and Franklin Park.[7] Seven of these municipalities are in the wealthy Sewickley Valley and North Hills areas to the north and northwest of Pittsburgh and all of them are in Allegheny County. Other high income areas in the region include southern Butler County where the townships of Cranberry and Adams have become extensions of the North Hills, and the fast-growing South Hills, including the streetcar suburb of Mount Lebanon, the post-war suburb of Upper St. Clair in Allegheny County, and the more recently developed areas surrounding the Southpointe office complex such as Peters and Cecil townships in northern Washington County. There are a greater number of districts (294) in the region, however, which have median household incomes below the Greater Pittsburgh median.[7] The ten districts with the lowest median household incomes are Duquesne, Braddock, Homestead, Rankin, Wilmerding, Arnold, East Pittsburgh, McKeesport, Uniontown, and Karns City.[7] Seven of these districts are also in Allegheny County clustered in the largely deindustrialized Mon Valley and Turtle Creek Valley areas. Other areas with significantly low household incomes are several rural municipalities in far northern Butler, Armstrong, and Indiana counties as well as most of eastern and northern Fayette County which all have less accessibility to the regions main employment centers. The former mill towns of the Beaver Valley as well as the cities of New Castle, Steubenville, and Weirton, and their environs also have noticeably low median household income compared to the rest of the region. Airports[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport is the primary airport providing commercial passenger service to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports with scheduled commercial service that are convenient to certain parts of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).

The tallest building in Pittsburgh is the 64-story U.S. Steel Tower, which rises 841 feet (256 m), was completed in 1970,[2] and is also the fifth tallest building in Pennsylvania. The second-tallest skyscraper in the city is BNY Mellon Center, which rises 725 feet (221 m).[3] The history of skyscrapers in Pittsburgh began with the 1895 completion of the Carnegie Building; this structure, rising 13 floors, was the first steel-framed skyscraper to be constructed in the city.[4][5] It never held the title of tallest structure in the city, however, as it did not surpass the 249-foot (76 m) tower of the Allegheny County Courthouse, which was completed in 1888.[6] The Carnegie Building was later demolished in 1952 to make way for an expansion of a Kaufmann's (now Burlington) department store.[7] Pittsburgh experienced a large building boom from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. During this time, 11 of the city's 20 tallest buildings were constructed, including the city's three tallest structures, the U.S. Steel Tower, BNY Mellon Center, and PPG Place. As of January 2020[update] the entire city had 10 completed skyscrapers that rise at least 492 feet (150 m), which ranks Pittsburgh's skyline 14th in the United States and 90th in the world, with two skyscrapers exceeding 700 feet (213 m).[8][A] Unlike many other major American cities, Pittsburgh was the site of relatively few skyscraper construction projects in the first two decades of the 21st century. Only two skyscrapers over 300 feet (91 m) have been completed since 2000. The 361-foot (110 m) Three PNC Plaza was completed in 2010,[11] and the 545-foot (166 m) Tower at PNC Plaza was completed in 2015, making it the city's most recently completed skyscraper.[12] Overall, as of September, 2022[update], there is one high-rise building over 300 feet (91 m) under construction, the FNB Financial Center.[13] Tallest buildings[edit] This list ranks completed and topped out Pittsburgh skyscrapers that stand at least 300 feet (91 m) tall, based on standard height measurements. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings.

Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins,[2][3] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season.[4][5] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become \"arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.\"[6] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman. Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the \"Cradle of Quarterbacks\"[7][8] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana. The hometown Pittsburgh Penguins NHL ice hockey team defeats the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs second round en route to winning the Stanley Cup championship two rounds later. As of 2024, this is the most recent major league sports championship won by a Pittsburgh team. Professional team sports[edit] The City of Pittsburgh has had various professional sports franchises throughout its history and today is home to three teams competing at the highest professional level in their respective sports: the Pittsburgh Pirates of the MLB, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL, and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL.

The Alleghenies won the game 7–3.[12] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association; only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first \"major league\" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute.[13] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss, who would go down in history as the \"Father of the modern World Series\" and its precursor, the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first \"modern\") baseball stadium, Forbes Field. Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925. The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport.[14] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960, 1971, and 1979. In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by Bill Mazeroski, and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards: Seasonal (Willie Stargell, co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game (Dave Parker), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season.[15] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times: six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 (Dick Groat), 1966 (Roberto Clemente), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 (Barry Bonds), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 (Andrew McCutchen) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 (Vernon Law) and 1990 (Doug Drabek). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore, regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies, Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915.[16] The Pittsburgh Keystones, Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues. With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team[1]—including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some[who?] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932.[17] Basketball[edit] Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The \"Black Fives\" league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920–23. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League. Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA, the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947–48 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL, posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers, which were owned by Harry Connick Sr.[citation needed] After the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title.[1] In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion, a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis,[18] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association, played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead, but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[19] Hockey[edit] See also: Flyers–Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia § Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall. The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905–1907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League, the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals. Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League.[20] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena.[21] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009.[22] The teams included players Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens, Jaromír Jágr, and Mario Lemieux.[23] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997.[24][25] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, throughout his career.[26] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy. He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era.[27] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009.[28] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football[edit] On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association. With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football.[citation needed] The first professional football game was held at Recreation Park in Pittsburgh.[citation needed] Heffelfinger scored the game's only points as the Allegheny Athletic Association defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, 4–0.[29][30] The early professional football era was also represented in Pittsburgh, by top athletic association teams in the Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit. The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, was the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. The first ever pro football all-star game was played at Exposition Park between the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and a collection of players from several teams in the area on December 3, 1898. Duquesne won the game 16–0. Later the Homestead Library & Athletic Club, fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900 and 1901. In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple, the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson, a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius, and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902. In 1933, as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney, who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.[31] Originally nicknamed the Pirates,[32] the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of producing steel. The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947.[33] In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team.[34] Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008.[33] As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[35] In October 1964, Ernie Stautner, who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' player to have his number—70—retired.[36] Charles \"Mean Joe\" Greene had his number—75—retired in 2014. In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.[37][38] Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers.[39] Outside of the NFL, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (which later became the Tampa Bay Storm), of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A second Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power, played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014.[40] In addition, Pittsburgh has also been home to women's full-contact football teams. The Pittsburgh Passion were founded in 2002 as members of the National Women's Football Association, then played in the Independent Women's Football League, and then Women's Football Alliance.[41] The Passion play their home games at West Allegheny High School in nearby Imperial. The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 as members of the NWFA.[42] The Pittsburgh Rebellion were members of the Legends Football League during the 2017 season with home games at the downtown Highmark Stadium. The \"most established area minor-league football team\" the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North American Football League's Regional American Football League.[43][44] The United States Football League (2022) announced that the league would be relaunching in April 2022 and that the Pittsburgh Maulers would be returning[45] Soccer[edit] Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC are members of the USL Championship (second division) and play at Highmark Stadium.[46] The Riverhounds are one of the oldest professional soccer clubs in the United States operating outside of MLS; the only two older clubs are fellow USL Championship side Charleston Battery and USL League One's Richmond Kickers, both of which were founded in 1993. Like their counterparts, the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, the Riverhounds are a full-time professional club, and many of their current and former players have represented their countries in international play. In 2024, the USL W League announced that the Riverhounds' ownership group had established a women's team to begin competing in 2025. [47] Several months later, the club's name, Pittsburgh Riveters SC, and crest were unveiled. [48] Historic teams such as the suburban Harmarville Hurricanes won the U.S. Open Cup, U.S. Soccer's national championship, with Harmarville winning in 1952 and 1956 and reaching the final in 1953. Pittsburgh area teams Gallatin and Morgan Strasser also won the Open Cup in its earlier years, but since the end of the 1950s, only the Riverhounds have advanced as far as the quarterfinals, which they achieved in 2001 and 2023. The amateur club Pittsburgh Beadling has contested for regional and national titles for over 100 years, winning the National Amateur Cup in 1954,[49] though Beadling now operates primarily as a youth club. Aldo Donelli, better known as a Duquesne University Football player and coach played soccer with a number of clubs in the 1920s and 1930s and was a member of the United States men's national soccer team during the 1934 FIFA World Cup. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In a 4–2 qualifying victory over Mexico in Rome, Italy on May 24, he tallied all four times, becoming the first American to score his first three international goals with the senior team in the same match. The region's interest in soccer continues as modern stars such as natives Justin Evans, Meghan Klingenberg, Don Malinowski, John Stollmeyer, A. J. Wood and Marvell Wynne II have all achieved international success. Rugby[edit] The Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club are rugby union team based in South Side Pittsburgh. The club formed in 2018 when the Pittsburgh City RC and the Pittsburgh Highlanders combined to form the Forge. The Pittsburgh Forge currently fields two competitive men's senior sides and one competitive women's side. The men currently participate in the Midwest Competition Region (NCR1) at the Division II and Division III levels, and the women also play in the Midwest Competition Region at the Division II level. The Pittsburgh Sledgehammers are a rugby league team based in Cheswick, Pennsylvania (outside of Pittsburgh) which was formed in 2010 and plays in the AMNRL competition. The Pittsburgh Harlequins are a rugby union team also based in Cheswick. The Pittsburgh Harlequins Rugby Club was founded in 1973 by a group of University of Pittsburgh law students. The organization has an active roster of 45 players and an alumni roster inclusive of more than 70 seasons of play. The Harlequins Rugby Club is a Division I member of the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union. Over 300 active players wear the Harlequin jerseys every year at the Division 1 men's, Under 19, and Under 14 levels. In 1995, the Founders Field Center for Athletic Leadership was developed to support the Harlequins Men's and Youth programs. The 12-acre Founders Field facility includes lighting, irrigation, a clubhouse, locker rooms, concessions, and parking. The Pittsburgh Steeltoes, a Rugby sevens club with both a men's and women's team, was announced as an expansion team for the Premier Rugby Sevens in 2023.[50] Highmark Stadium hosted the 2023 Eastern Conference Final, marking the first ever professional rugby event held in the city.[51] Three of the Steeltoes' women represented their countries at the 2024 Summer Olympics: Kayla Canett and Sammy Sullivan for United States and Asia Hogan-Rochester for Canada,[52] winning bronze and silver, respectively.[53] Ultimate[edit] The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds are a professional ultimate team that competes in the Ultimate Frisbee Association (formerly known as the American Ultimate Disc League) since 2015. They play their home games at Highmark Stadium.

Among the variety are Catfish and Trout. [2] Rowing/Rafting/Kayaking[edit] Pittsburgh is the host city for both the annual Three Rivers Regatta (since 1977) and the annual Head of the Ohio (since 1987) races and events. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University as well as several area high schools have long standing rowing teams. In 2010 National Geographic named the city to its top six of \"Best Cities for Kayaking\".[55] Kayak Pittsburgh is the largest river recreation rental in the area located on the North Shore on the Allegheny River. Suburban Ohiopyle State Park offers some of the best white-water rafting in the country. Trails/Camping/Biking[edit] Pittsburgh has multiple mountain biking areas close to the city in area parks and in the surrounding suburbs. Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails. A recent project, \"Rails to Trails\", has converted miles of former railroads to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington, D.C. bike/walking trail. Kayaking is popular on the city's three rivers. Pittsburgh and its region are internationally known for its extensive and varied trail system. Such assets as the Three Rivers, Ohio River, Youghiogheny River, Beaver River, Indian Creek, Panhandle, Laurel Highlands, Rachel Carson, Five Star and Montour offer stunning, natural, suburban and urban views of the metropolitan area. The Great Allegheny Passage provides an all natural-trail (non motorized) link to Washington, D.C., while the North Country Trail passes through the northern suburbs of the city and connects Bismarck, North Dakota to the Plattsburgh, New York area, with such cities as Duluth, Minnesota and Buffalo, New York in its path. Within the urban core of the city and its immediate surroundings the Steps of Pittsburgh offer an urban hiking experience. \"Urban oasis\" parks that bring the wilds of nature into the middle of the urban core and feature over a mile of trails within their individual boundaries include: Point State, Frick, Highland, Schenley, Riverview, Grandview, South Side, Riverfront, Three Rivers, Point of View, and Roberto Clemente. Large 500–2,000 acre suburban parks that feature several miles of diverse trails each are plentiful throughout the metropolitan area. Northern suburbs: North, Hartwood Acres, Harrison Hills, Deer Lakes, Moraine, McConnells Mill Southern suburbs: South, Round Hill, Ohiopyle, Western suburbs: Settler's Cabin, Hillman, Raccoon Creek. Eastern suburbs: Boyce, White Oak, Renziehausen, Keystone, Laurel Mountain, Laurel Ridge, Laurel Summit, Linn Run, Forbes For hikers/trailblazers that desire a historical or cultural element to nature the metropolitan area offers the Fort Necessity National Battlefield, Bushy Run Battlefield, the Bear Run conservancy containing both Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob, the smaller yet hikable Meadowcroft Rock Shelter features pre-Columbian archeology. The large urban parks described earlier such as Schenley Park includes several historical/cultural sites including Phipps Conservatory and proximity to Schenley Plaza, the Cathedral of Learning, Hillman Library and the Frick Gallery. Riverview includes the Allegheny Observatory and Point includes the Fort Pitt Museum and the remains of Fort Duquesne. For true environmentalists and wildlife fans the metro area includes the Jennings Environmental Education Center, as well the Allegheny Islands State Park, Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Ohioplye for hiking and water sports. Tennis[edit] Such teams as the Pittsburgh Triangles have built a small but loyal fan base for tennis in the region, being a perennial championship contender in the 1970s and winning a world title in 1975. Generations later the region still has deep tennis roots with the year-round all-weather Mellon Park Tennis Center being a world class facility for the sport, and helping to develop natives such as Bjorn Fratangelo, Bonnie Gadusek, Donald Johnson and Gretchen Magers in succeeding in international competition and rankings. From 1979 to 1984 the city also hosted a yearly international tournament, the Pittsburgh Open. Skiing/skating[edit] Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, Wisp Ski Resort and Boyce Park offer skiing with both PPG Place and North Park offering ice skating. In 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins created a new public rink in the South Side neighborhood's Southside Works called \"Penguin Pond\". Year round ice skating and skating events can be enjoyed at indoor area rinks including the Rostraver Ice Garden, Island Sports Center, IceoPlex at Southpointe and Bladerunners Ice Complex. Such notable olympians as natives Kristi Leskinen, Kylie Gleason, Suna Murray, Ron Robertson, Mike Seibert, Suzanne Semanick, Jamie Silverstein and Taylor Toth have trained and began their careers at area facilities. Youth sports Youth football Suburban league, Big East youth football league Penn Trafford, Woodland Hills, Greater Latrobe, Jeannette, PHMFA, Arken, Franklin Regional, Plum, Mckeesport, Gateway College sports[edit] There are several universities within the city that field athletic teams in NCAA Division I including the University of Pittsburgh (often referred to as \"Pitt\"), Duquesne University and Robert Morris University. Of these, Pitt is the only school that is a member of the so-called \"Power Five\" conferences that are primary partners in the College Football Playoff structure (the Atlantic Coast Conference). Other universities in Pittsburgh that field athletic teams include Carnegie Mellon University (Division III), Chatham University (Division III), Point Park University (NAIA), and Carlow University (NAIA). Football[edit] College football in Pittsburgh dates back to the University of Pittsburgh which first organized a football team in 1889 and played its first sanctioned game in 1890. In the first half of the 20th century, Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie Tech (now called Carnegie Mellon) all fielded football squads that made \"major\" bowl game appearances from the 1920s through the 1930s. These appearances included Duquesne in the 1933 and 1936 Orange Bowl, Carnegie Tech in the 1938 Sugar Bowl, and the University of Pittsburgh appearing in four Rose Bowls (1927, 1929, 1932, 1936) as well as nearby Washington and Jefferson College in the 1922 Rose Bowl.[56] In particular, Pitt was a national power during this era, claiming 8 national championships under the guidance of coaching legends such as Pop Warner and Jock Sutherland. More recently, the Panthers won another National Championship in 1976 and competed for several more through the 1980s. Multiple inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame played at Pitt, including Dan Marino, Tony Dorsett, Mike Ditka, and Larry Fitzgerald.[57] Pitt is the only university in Western Pennsylvania to still play college football at the highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision, while Duquesne and Robert Morris have football teams that compete in the Football Championship Subdivision, and Carnegie Mellon fields a Division III football team.

Pitt and Duquesne have played the annual City Game since 1932. Duquesne was the city's first team to appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP Poll ranking (1954),[58] and to win a post-season national title, the 1955 National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne is the only college program to produce back-to-back NBA No. 1 overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green.[59] Duquesne's Chuck Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team.[60] The Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a \"national title game\" against LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13 conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 26 times including a post season tournament every season between 1999-2000 and 2015-2016 during which time it regularly sold out the Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All Americans while ranking No. 1 in the nation as recently as 2009. The Petersen Events Center is home to the \"Oakland Zoo\", a student section which is nationally recognized[61] for its passionate members and perseverance through consecutive unsuccessful seasons from 2016 to 2022.[62] The suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA Division I basketball since the 1970s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament in each of the last four decades (8). In the 2013 National Invitation Tournament the Colonials notched an upset win over the defending national champions Kentucky Wildcats. Pitt women's basketball has also made recent appearances in the NCAA tournament.[63] A rivalry game between Pitt and Duquesne, termed the City Game, is played annually between the two schools' men's and women's basketball teams, as well as their baseball teams.

Roads and infrastructure[edit] The high number of freeze/thaw cycles during the winter is sometimes blamed for the difficulty of maintaining local roads. Streets[edit] A 1795 map of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is home to several notable streets. Roslyn Place is a small wooden-paved cul-de-sac located in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The street was built in 1914 in the Nicolson Pavement style and is home to the historic Roslyn Place district. Canton Avenue is the steepest officially recorded public street in the United States.[1][2][3] East Carson Street has one of the largest concentrations of 19th-century homes, which has prompted outsiders to call the neighborhood the City's Georgetown.[4] It includes many bars and restaurants as well as residences. Grant Street is the main government and business corridor in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is home to the global headquarters of U.S. Steel, Koppers Chemicals, Federated Investors, and Oxford Development. It also is home to the seat of Allegheny County, City of Pittsburgh and the regional Federal Government offices. It is part of the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District. Expressways[edit] Map showing major highways in Pittsburgh and its surrounding region The main highway connecting Pittsburgh to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) on the east is I-376, known to locals as the \"Parkway East.\" It includes the locally-notorious Squirrel Hill interchange, where unusual traffic patterns and the adjoining tunnel often cause traffic congestion. Several accidents have involved tall trucks getting stuck against the tunnel roof. Also part of I-376 is the \"Parkway West,\" which leads from downtown Pittsburgh to the Pittsburgh International Airport's main terminal and leads into the contiguous Airport Parkway and Southern Expressway. I-279, known as the \"Parkway North,\" runs north of the city to merge with I-79. It connects the city with the North Hills and the Cranberry area. There is no \"Parkway South\". I-579, or the \"Crosstown Boulevard,\" is a spur off of I-279 that alleviates downtown and North Shore traffic headed north or south and to events at either the convention center or the PPG Paints Arena. North of the city, the Parkway North and a short section of Interstate 579 over the Veterans Bridge have reversible high occupancy vehicle HOV lanes for rush-hour commuting, which require a minimum of two occupants per vehicle for use; no electric/hybrid vehicle \"HOV OK\" program has yet been made available. On August 25, 1995, six people were killed in a head-on collision on the HOV lanes after PennDOT employee William Dean Snyder failed to follow procedures. Snyder maintained open the traffic gates for both directions simultaneously. Belt system[edit] Allegheny County Belt System Main article: Allegheny County Belt System Unlike many other major U.S. cities, Pittsburgh lacks a dedicated contiguous beltway surrounding the city. I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike), I-79, and I-70 form a roughly triangular-shaped \"beltway,\" but the distance of these roads from the city center and the need to exit and enter each leg in order to continue circling the city render them impractical as a beltway; commuters are forced to use secondary roads to go from suburb to suburb. The Allegheny County Belt System is an attempt at dealing with this without building additional infrastructure. The Pittsburgh Wayfinder System is a similar system that aims to guide travelers to popular destinations and services in the city proper. Bridges and tunnels[edit] Main articles: List of bridges of Pittsburgh and List of tunnels in Pittsburgh Liberty Bridge with the entrance to the Liberty Tunnels shown in the background. Pittsburgh is a city of bridges: over 2,000 bridges dot the landscape of Allegheny County. The southern entrance to Downtown is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and then over the Fort Pitt Bridge.[5] The Panhandle Bridge, a former railroad bridge, carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue and Red (formerly 42S/47L) light rail lines across the Monongahela River. Other notable bridges are Fort Duquesne Bridge, the Liberty Bridge, and The Three Sisters.[citation needed] Notable tunnels include two interstate highway tunnels on I-376, Fort Pitt Tunnel and Squirrel Hill Tunnel; major traffic tunnels Armstrong Tunnel and Liberty Tunnels; the light rail tunnel, Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel, the Schenley Tunnel, the Wabash Tunnel and Corliss Tunnel.[citation needed] Pittsburgh Regional Transit[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh Regional Transit Local public transportation is coordinated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 14th-largest urban mass transit system in the United States. It services 730 square miles (1,900 km2), including all of Allegheny County and portions of Armstrong, Beaver, Washington, and Westmoreland counties.[6] PRT maintains a network of intracity bus routes, two inclines on Mt. Washington above Downtown (mostly a tourist attraction rather than a means of commuting), and a light rail/busway system. The transit agency discontinued its commuter rail system, the PATrain, in 1989, However, A New Line To Arnold Has Been Proposed Since 2009. Light rail[edit] A light rail vehicle departs Station Square and prepares to enter the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel. Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail, Red Line (Pittsburgh), Blue Line (Pittsburgh), and Silver Line (Pittsburgh) The light rail network is a direct descendant of the original streetcar system, which once numbered dozens of lines and included interurban routes to neighboring cities such as Washington and Charleroi. The current network comprises five routes on 25 miles (40 km) of track, operated by modern articulated light rail vehicles. Although most is on dedicated right-of-way, including the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel, trains still street run in the Beechview neighborhood. Once across the Monongahela River trains enter a subway to serve Downtown Pittsburgh. Since March 2012, the North Shore Connector has extended service across the Allegheny River, via tunnel, to such destinations as PNC Park, Heinz Field, and Rivers Casino. Light rail lines are designated by the following colors: Red Line—former 42S South Hills Village via Beechview light rail route Blue Line—former 47S South Hills Village via Overbrook light rail route Silver Line — former 47L Library via Overbrook light rail route Bus rapid transit[edit] Herron station on the East Busway Main articles: Pittsburgh Regional Transit § Bus rapid transit, South Busway, Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, and West Busway PAT operates over 800 buses on both standard routes and bus rapid transit routes in Allegheny County. The latter use high-speed articulated buses that run at grade and above ground on their own right-of-way with platform stations, much like a rail system. In some instances, such as the Mount Washington tunnel, these buses travel along paved sections of the light rail line. There are currently three routes: the South Busway, from downtown to the southern part of Allegheny County, the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, from the Amtrak station to the eastern suburbs, and the West Busway, to the western suburbs. Future plans include extending the West Busway to the Pittsburgh International Airport. All light rail/busway stations outside the downtown have PAT station shuttles that serve the surrounding neighborhoods, and sections of the metropolitan area not served by the light rail/busway system, including most of the northern suburbs, have regular PAT bus routes. The mass transit systems of Beaver, Fayette, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland counties (including Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority) operate their own commuter shuttles to and from the city; the private company Myers Coach Line operates commuter service from Butler County.[7] The mass transit system of Monongalia County, West Virginia also provides connections to Pittsburgh. In early 2005 the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission proposed combining Pittsburgh Regional Transit, then known as Port Authority, with the nine surrounding metro counties transit agencies.[8][9][failed verification] Busways are designated by the following colors: Green—bus routes using the West Busway, designated with a 'G' Purple—bus routes using the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, designated with a 'P' Orange—bus routes using the I-279 HOV lane, designated with an 'O' Yellow—bus routes using the South Busway, designated with a 'Y' Funiculars[edit] Main articles: Monongahela Incline and Duquesne Incline Lower station of the Monongahela Incline. Two inclines ascend Mount Washington: Duquesne Incline and Monongahela Incline. Pittsburgh had considerably more inclines and the Monongahela Incline was paralleled by a freight incline.[citation needed] Intercity travel[edit] Pittsburgh International Airport[edit] Main article: Pittsburgh International Airport Pittsburgh International Airport concourse B The city is primarily served by Pittsburgh International Airport in suburban Findlay Township, Pennsylvania, formerly a hub and key focus city for US Airways.[10] Pittsburgh is also served by other area airports. General aviation is served by the Allegheny County Airport. Its terminal is of a 1920s art-deco design. It once hosted Charles Lindbergh and handles 139,000 private and corporate-jet flights a year. A secondary reliever airport is in the eastern suburb of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Over the last few decades the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport has been served by 2-3 daily flights from US Airways, Northwest Airlines/Delta Air Lines, and presently Spirit Airlines, as well as serving as a general aviation hub for east hills communities. Other area airports include: North Metro: Butler County Airport Zelienople Municipal Airport Rock Airport New Castle Municipal Airport Lakehill Airport South Metro: Allegheny County Airport Rostraver Airport Joseph A. Hardy Connellsville Airport Washington County Airport East Metro: Arnold Palmer Regional Airport Greensburg Jeannette Regional Airport Indiana County-Jimmy Stewart Airport West Metro: Beaver County Airport Eddie Dew Memorial Airpark (Ohio) Jefferson County Airpark (Ohio) Herron Airport (West Virginia) Wheeling Airport (West Virginia) Grant Street Transportation Center[edit] Main article: Grant Street Transportation Center Pittsburgh's Greyhound bus terminal Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[11] Pittsburgh Union Station[edit] Main article: Union Station (Pittsburgh) Pittsburgh Union Station Two Amtrak trains serve Penn Station: the Pennsylvanian to New York City via Philadelphia, and the Capitol Limited between Washington, D.C. and Chicago, which uses CSX from Washington to Pittsburgh's outer perimeter, the AVR on the P&W Subdivision through the Panther Hollow Tunnel in the university district, and NS from the AVR interchange through Penn Station to Chicago. Pedestrians and bicycling[edit] Pedestrian staircases[edit] Main article: Steps of Pittsburgh Public staircase at Duquesne University. Pittsburgh has more public staircases (737) than any other city in the United States, followed by Cincinnati and San Francisco.[12] Many of these staircases have street names, and lead to hillside neighborhoods that can be difficult to access by car in winter. The large number of steps are an engineering approach to the topography upon which the City of Pittsburgh is built. According to author Martin Aurand, Pittsburgh \"lies unevenly on unruly land\". The city is located at the confluence of two rivers which cut through elevated land of the Appalachian Plateau. The city is settled at elevations ranging from 710 to 1,300 feet (220 to 400 m) above sea level.[13] Pedestrian trails[edit] Unpaved portion of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail in Strip District Pittsburgh has a thriving cycling community despite steep hills and variable weather. Efforts have been made to incorporate the bicycle into the transportation system. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail encompasses all the trails in the city. The Eliza Furnace Trail, known locally as the \"Jail Trail\", stretches from Downtown (at the Allegheny County Jail) to the East End region, where trail access can be found along some roads. The North Shore Trail spans from the Alcosan plant along the Ohio River and continues along the Allegheny River to Millvale. The Southside Trail follows the Monongahela River and beyond Baldwin Borough connects to McKeesport via the Great Allegheny Passage. This trail, in connection with the C&O Canal Trail, forms a continuous motorist-free route from Point State Park in Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C. PAT has installed bike racks on all buses and it allows bikes on its subway/busway system at all times. Bicycles[edit] Healthy Ride station Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) is the local bicycle advocacy group and is working to make Pittsburgh increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to bicycle transportation. The non-profit bike collective,Free Ride, recycles bicycles and bike parts, teaches bicycle construction, and has programs to sell or earn a rebuilt bicycle. Additionally, bicycles can be borrowed at two places along the Heritage Trail through the Friends of the Riverfront/Dasani Blue Bikes program. In 2014, the City began installing segregated bike lanes, which provide greater physical safety to the biker.[14] On September 6, bike lanes that stretch from Downtown Pittsburgh to the 16th Street Bridge on Penn Avenue were installed. In order to accommodate these bike lanes, the Westbound lane of Penn Avenue was removed, making it one way. Other segregated bike lanes were installed on Schenley Drive in Oakland, and Saline Street in Greenfield.[15] The \"Healthy Ride\" bicycle-sharing system entered service in Spring, 2016, supplied by Nextbike. Price is $2 per half-hour, or $12 or $20 per month.[16] Freight Railroads[edit] CSX train crossing under the Smithfield Bridge in Pittsburgh During the heyday of the steel industry, Pittsburgh was among the largest rail centers not only in the nation, but the world. For many years, the multiple rail crossings in the suburb of Port Perry at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the Monongahela River and adjacent to the Edgar Thomson Works and Duquesne mills, was the highest concentration of freight traffic in the world. Even today, with river traffic included, Port Perry is often very near or at the top of the list. The Conway Yard to the west of the city along the Ohio River was the largest rail yard in the world from 1956 until 1980. From the beginning of the industrial era in America through its collapse in the 1980s, Pittsburgh was a key market for the nation's largest and most important railroads (most notably the Pennsylvania Railroad [the largest company in the world for much of the 20th century], and the New York Central Railroad [via the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie], Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Pittsburgh & West Virginia). Despite the near-complete collapse of heavy industry in the Northeast, Pittsburgh remains an extremely important link in the nation's rail network. Current railroads in Pittsburgh include: Class I railroads[edit] Norfolk Southern (NS)[edit] Norfolk Southern operates the former assets of Conrail, composed of the Pennsylvania Railroad, instrumental in the formation of modern Pittsburgh. NS operates three lines through Pittsburgh: the original line, the Pittsburgh Line, from U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Steel Mill in Braddock, PA, over the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh, into Island Ave Yard where it becomes the Fort Wayne Line; the Mon Line, along the south bank of the Monongahela River from West Brownsville, PA, to Island Ave Yard, formerly the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad. This line is used by coal trains from southern Pennsylvania and trains with over-height cars that cannot fit under the roof of Penn Station on the Pittsburgh Line, accessing it via a branch just east of Braddock to the Port Perry bridge. The Mon Line joins the Fort Wayne Line at Island Ave Yard after crossing the Ohio River on the Ohio Connecting (OC) Railroad bridge; the Conemaugh Line, along the north shore of the Allegheny River, serving several coal branch lines and power plants. Operations are centered on a small yard in Etna, PA. On the Mon and Pittsburgh lines over 60 trains a day pass through the city. CSX[edit] CSX operates the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE). Many of the old B&O lines have been removed or are unused. Formerly an important part of the B&O system, Glenwood Yard is leased and operated by the Allegheny Valley Railroad for local jobs. The yard used to give access to the B&O's Grant Street Station in Downtown Pittsburgh. The building has been rebuilt into a PNC Bank building and the old right-of-way is now a bike path. The B&O main line, which cuts north and under across Pittsburgh by the Schenley Tunnel, is now used by the AVR. The 33rd Street Railroad Bridge over the Allegheny River is still used: AVR trains connect with Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line about a mile east of Penn Station. CSX freight trains use the former P&LE through McKeesport, PA, and Braddock, PA, before crossing the Mononghela River into Homestead, PA. The P&LE line and the Mon Line run side by side until the Mon Line crosses the Ohio Connecting Railroad Bridge at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. On an average day, the P&LE line carries about 30–35 trains. Class II railroads[edit] Wheeling & Lake Erie[edit] The Wheeling & Lake Erie is a regional railroad incorporated in 1990 after the Norfolk and Western Railway sold trackage from the original Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad. Wheeling and Lake Erie R.R. Bessemer & Lake Erie[edit] The Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad runs north from the North Bessemer Yard in Penn Hills to Conneaut, Ohio. In 2004, the B&LE was purchased by Canadian National Railway. Class III railroads[edit] Allegheny Valley Railroad[edit] The Allegheny Valley Railroad runs mostly on former Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad lines. AVR (Allegheny Valley Railroad) Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad[edit] The Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad operates former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage on the Chartiers Branch and the Panhandle Route to the southwest. Union Railroad[edit] Union Railroad mainly serves the last remaining steel mills in the city. It has interchanges with the B&LE at North Bessemer.

They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like [[Category:XYZ]] in its wiki markup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ. Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships. Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation. The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename—and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. (See also the search box parameter \"incategory\".) The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below. Summary The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories, to which any editable page can be added. To add a page to a category, include \"[[Category:Category name]]\" or \"[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]\" in that page's wiki markup. The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page. A category is usually associated with a category page in the \"Category:\" namespace.[1] A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories. The bottom of a Wikipedia article on Chicken eyeglasses. At the very bottom of the page, below the References, navigation templates and external links are a series of links. These links are the categories used on the page, which include: Category:Animal welfare, Category:Animal equipment, Category:Eyewear, and Category:Poultry farming. By clicking on the category link at the bottom of the page, readers can navigate the Category tree. Category page definition A category page is any page in the Category namespace. They each act as a category, and are termed a \"category\". The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other \"categories\", and one section titled Pages, listing pages as categorized (in other namespaces). New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace. A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: First a count and list of subcategories (other categories belonging to the category) is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by counts like \"(6 C, 38 P, 2 F)\", meaning this subcategory contains 6 subcategories, 38 pages, and 2 files. Counts of 0 are omitted. The further subcategories are expanded in the display if the ► sign alongside the subcategory is clicked (the ► is only visible if your browser has JavaScript enabled). Note: ► is shown if there are no further subcategories. The subcategory is collapsed again if ▼ is clicked. Next a count and list of pages in the category (excluding subcategories and images) is shown. If the category has no members, a message to that effect is displayed. Next a count and list of image and other media files in the category appears, if any exist. These are shown with thumbnails. The first 20 characters of the file name are shown, with an ellipsis if that is not the full name; also the file size is shown. The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it (the name of the image). For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections. To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space. A category page can only display a limited number of members (currently 200). If there are more members, there will be a link to the next page. The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e., its parent categories (the categories of which it is a subcategory). Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the \"[[Category:Category name]]\" or \"[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]\" syntax. Putting pages into categories ShortcutWP:PAGECAT See also: Help:VisualEditor § Editing categories A page becomes part of a category if the page's wiki markup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form [[Category:Category name]] or [[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]. The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between <nowiki>...</nowiki> or <includeonly>...</includeonly> tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below. A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title. If the category name begins with a lower-case letter, it will be capitalized. For initial lower-case letters, as in Category:macOS, see the technical restrictions page. On Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wiki markup, but before any stub templates (which themselves transclude categories). When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wiki markup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as red links if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page. Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories. Working with category pages The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions. Linking to category pages To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category:Category name]]. Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink. (The {{cl}} template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful.) Retrieving raw category information Raw information about the members of a category, their sort keys and timestamps (time when last added to the category) can be obtained from the API, using a query of the form: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?cmtitle=Category:Category_name&action=query&list=categorymembers&cmlimit=500&cmprop=title|sortkey|timestamp Listings of up to 500 members are possible. If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this: <categorymembers cmcontinue=\"page|NNNN|TITLE\" />. This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members: ...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE Sorting category pages ShortcutWP:SORTCAT By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so \"ABC\" comes after \"Abacus\". Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex, a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore. The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories. This means that digit sequences in page names are treated according to their numerical value, not as strings. Thus \"9 dogs\", \"25 dogs\", and \"112 dogs\" will all appear under the \"0–9\" heading in numerical order, and V838 Monocerotis will appear before V1309 Scorpii. Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator \"Category:\" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list: [[Category:Category name|Sortkey]] For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to Category:1879 births and have the article sorted by \"Einstein, Albert\", you would type: [[Category:1879 births|Einstein, Albert]] Unlike a piped link (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page. It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY. Default sort key ShortcutWP:DEFAULTSORT This section documents functionality. For guidelines, see WP:NAMESORT and WP:SORTKEY. It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from {{PAGENAME}} by using the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT:}}: {{DEFAULTSORT:new key}} This is often used in biography articles, to make sure the subject is sorted by their last name: {{DEFAULTSORT:LastName, FirstName}} For example, on the Albert Einstein page, {{DEFAULTSORT:Einstein, Albert}} adds the sort key \"Einstein, Albert\" to all his categories, such as Category:1879 births. In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also \"hidden\" (included by another template). Searching for pages in categories Further information: Help:Searching § Syntax See also: Wikipedia:Category intersection In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:\"CategoryName\" in the search box. A pipe \"|\" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter incategory:\"Suspension bridges|Bridges in New York City\" to return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as here. Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories. Listing all categories Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one. The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages. To list all existing category pages (regardless of whether they have members), use Special:AllPages/Category:. Displaying category trees and page counts As described at mw:Help:Magic words, {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Example}} or {{PAGESINCAT:Example}} returns the number of pages in \"Category:Example\". Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted. The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category (its subcategories, their subcategories and so on; the display of files and other member pages is optional). The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page. (This is sometimes done on the category page itself, if the category is split over multiple screens, to make all subcategories available on every screen.) The basic syntax is <categorytree>Category name</categorytree> to display just the subcategory tree, and <categorytree mode=pages>Category name</categorytree> to display member pages as well. They will be indicated by italics. Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure. You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all, instead. Warning: The following code {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{PAGENAME}}}} will not work as expected when used in the wikitext or in a transcluded template in a category page whose title contains some ASCII punctuations. For legacy reasons, {{PAGENAME}} may return the page name with these characters being HTML-encoded using numeric character entities : this still works for generating derived wikilinks or displaying page names, or when HTML-encoded this page name is used in a conditional \"#switch\", but PAGESINCATEGORY does not recognize the category name given in parameter if some characters are HTML-encoded (this is the case notably when the category name contains ASCII apostrophes ' and a few other ASCII punctuations. (The same HTML-encoding is also applied to the values returned by {{FULLPAGENAME}}, {{SUBPAGENAME}}, or {{NAMESPACE}}). In that case, as the category is not found by its HTML-encoded pagename, PAGESINCATEGORY will unexpectedly return 0 and not its effective number of member pages. A simple workaround is to transform these HTML-encoded characters back into standard UTF-8-encoded characters, by using the {{titleparts:}} parser function, like this: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}}}}} Moving and redirecting category pages Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal #REDIRECT [[...]] but a {{category redirect}}. Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion. Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a {{category redirect}} template. See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion § Redirecting categories for more on category redirects. Hiding categories When the magic word __HIDDENCAT__ is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden, meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the {{hidden category}} template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages. For users who are not logged in, hidden categories are displayed on category pages (whether as parent categories or subcategories). Hidden categories are displayed at the bottom of each page, after \"Hidden categories:\", for registered users: at preview during editing; if the user has selected \"Show hidden categories\" in their user preferences. Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories. For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT. Tracking categories Tracking categories are used to track technical featues or problems. They are outside of the category structure for articles. Pages may be inserted into those by the MediaWiki software, or by templates or modules. Usually they are hidden, or even red ie not created. Special:TrackingCategories lists all tracking categories populated by the MediaWiki software. Category:Tracking categories is the top for tracking categories on this wiki. Finding articles for a category The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the \"What links here\" tool on the category's main article. An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used. More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their \"See also\" sections (if existent) and the automatically suggested \"RELATED ARTICLES\" below them. Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category. Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes \" (with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an OR) and appending the word wiki or Wikipedia or site:Wikipedia.org to them. Categorizing Main page: Wikipedia:Categorization Categorizing templates Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that [[Category: Some-topic templates]] should be placed on the template's documentation page (or inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, if there is no documentation page), this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion (see below). Categories and templates A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g. <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly>). When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page. This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories. Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page. When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved. When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached. To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the \"includeonly\" tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it). Parser functions can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME. Passing a category name as a parameter <includeonly>[[Category:{{{cat|default}}}]]</includeonly> or <includeonly>{{{cat|[[Category:default]]}}}</includeonly>If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page [[Category:XXX]], otherwise it will be categorized at the page [[Category:default]]. Calling the template with \"cat=\" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any category. Excluding non-article pages <includeonly>{{#if:{{NAMESPACE}} | | [[Category:XXX]]}}</includeonly>the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles. For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in Category:XXX. On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See Categorization using templates in the categorization guideline. Categorizing redirect pages Main page: Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects Redirect pages can be categorized and there are conventions on how to do it. The redirect link must be first on the page. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics. \"Related Changes\" with categories For a category, the \"Related Changes\" feature, when applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages which are currently listed as belonging to a category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their editable parts are listed. Notice that \"Related Changes\" does not show edits to pages that have been removed from the category. Also, \"Related Changes\" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). If a workaround would be required, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page. As usual – unlike with watchlists – recent changes to corresponding talk pages are not shown under \"Related Changes\". Pages that one is watching are bolded on the list. This can help to find which pages in a given category one has on one's watchlist. The DynamicPageList (third-party) extension provides a list of last edits to the pages in a category, or optionally, just the list of pages; the simpler DynamicPageList (Wikimedia) is installed on Meta, Wikinews, Wikibooks and Wikiversity; the extension mw:Extension:DPLforum is installed on Wikia. Watching category additions and removals Since 2016, additions and removals from categories are available via the \"Category changes\" filter on recent changes pages, including watchlists and Special:RecentChangesLinked. For example, category changes to articles in Category:Cannabis stubs can be found here. You can monitor additions and removals from specific categories by adding the categories to your watchlist and making sure the \"Category changes\" filter is active. You can view changes to categories in your watchlist by clicking here. Additional scripts with similar functionality are User:CategoryWatchlistBot and User:Ais523/catwatch. See also MediaWiki: Help:Categories Template:Category TOC Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization Wikipedia:WikiProject Categories Wikipedia:Quick cat index How to move a category Notes ^ The category itself is permanently created as soon as it has been saved on to any page. Unless you create a category page, it will display as a red link. Unless you add another category to the category page, it will not be placed in the category tree. Category pages are created like any other page. Most commonly, editors click on the redlink in an article and create the category page that way. vteWikipedia help pages Visit the Teahouse or the Help desk for an interactive Q & A forum. FAQs (?)

It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing \"attention en masse\" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). Wikipedia articles (tagged in this month) that use mm dd yyyy date formats, whether by application of the first main contributor rule or by virtue of close national ties to the subject belong in this category. Use {{Use mdy dates}} to add an article to this category. See MOS:DATE. This system of tagging or categorisation is used as a status monitor of all articles that use mm dd yyyy date formats, and not as a clean up.
