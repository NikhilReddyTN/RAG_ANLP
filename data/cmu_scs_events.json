These requirements give students the chance to learn more about the world from scientific and humanistic points of view — skills our students will need as they solve problems with scientists and engineers, artists, social and cognitive scientists, historians, linguists, economists and business experts. Plus, SCS students will need to communicate effectively and understand the ethical implications of their work. The general education requirements help our students gain this broad perspective so they can work well in a changing, connected world. Requirements Overview All SCS students must complete a minimum of 63 units of humanities and arts requirements and a minimum of 36 units of science and engineering requirements. For the humanities and arts requirements, SCS students must complete: For the science and engineering requirements, SCS students must complete: Mini courses may be allowed as a half course for some of these requirements. SCS students should consult with an advisor for details. All SCS students must also completeCore@CMU(3 units), typically during their first year, to gain exposure to thecore competenciesthat all CMU students should demonstrate upon graduation.

Only one in four schools offer any form of digital literacy classes — a staggering number, given that the U.S. will have about 1.4 million computer science-related jobs in 2020. As it stands now, we’ll only have enough CS grads nationally to fill about a third of them. To make matters worse, most of the schools that offer CS classes reside in affluent school districts, creating a big knowledge gap between kids from different socioeconomic backgrounds.In SCS, we’re working hard to bridge that gap and introduce students to computer science well before they get to college. Check out how we’re giving students, teachers and community organizations more access to computer science resources, and how you can help us in our efforts. We've also included programs that help current SCS students during their time at CMU. This list will grow and change over time, so be sure to check back frequently. SCS Outreach Hubs SCS Outreach Programs AI for Teachers Workshop AI for Teachers supports high school educators who want to gain familiarity with AI and offer AI-related educational activities for their students. The workshop covers an introduction to a broad range of artificial intelligence topics including machine learning, deep learning, search algorithms, information retrieval and recommender systems.

A message from Manuela Veloso - Herbert A. Simon University Professor   Machine Learning (ML) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and practice where  we investigate how  computer agents can improve their perception, cognition, and action  with experience. Machine Learning is about machines improving from  data, knowledge, experience, and interaction.Machine Learning  utilizes a variety of techniques to intelligently handle large and complex amounts of  information build upon foundations  in many disciplines, including  statistics, knowledge representation, planning and control, databases, causal inference, computer systems, machine vision, and natural  language processing.AI agents with their core at Machine Learning aim at interacting with humans in a  variety of ways, including providing estimates on phenomena, making  recommendations for decisions, and being instructed and corrected.In our Machine Learning Department, we study and research the  theoretical foundations of the field of Machine Learning, as well as  on the contributions to the general intelligence of the field of  Artificial Intelligence. In addition to their theoretical education, all of our students, advised by faculty, get hands-on experience with  complex real datasets.Machine Learning can impact many applications relying on all sorts of  data, basically any data that is recorded in computers, such as health  data, scientific data, financial data, location data, weather data, energy data, etc. As our society increasingly relies on digital data, Machine Learning is crucial for most of our current and future  applications.

Carol created this fund with a preference for work that continues the explorationfor potable drinking water on land, sea, the poles of the moon or any planet beyond earth.  “In my travels around the globe, I’ve seen so much inequality, and a lack of clean water is one of them. I’ve always wanted to do something to help our planet; therefore, in my heart, my endowed fund is a small start for the good of the world.”  Carol Karnell Lampe (MM 1967) with Matthew Johnson-Roberson, director of the Robotics Institute.
