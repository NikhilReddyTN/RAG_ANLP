The trees are still budding, the grass just beginning to wake, but Pittsburgh is already marching into green (pun intended!). Banners unfurl, Irish flags flutter from storefronts, and on March 15, the city’s streets will flood with shamrock-clad revelers for a parade that has wound through Liberty Avenue for over 150 years. The first flush of spring belongs to the Irish. “St. Patrick’s Day, to me, is the day that other non-Irish individuals, communities recognize us,” Jim Lamb, president of the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “We get to expose them to our culture, our achievements, our challenges. But when the month of March passes, we are still Irish Americans. We continue to advocate for our community, our ancestral land. We continue to practice our faith, our culture by playing sports, supporting dance schools, celebrating the great Irish writers, and enjoying the music throughout the year.” The Irish in Pittsburgh The Irish have shaped Pittsburgh since the early 19th century, arriving in search of opportunity and refuge. “Irish culture is best understood through a sense and acknowledgment of Ireland’s many invasions,” says Lamb. “Celts, Vikings, Normans, English — they came as conquerors, and in time, they became as Irish as the Irish themselves.” The same pattern repeated itself in America, though the road was far from easy. The first major wave of Irish immigrants to Pittsburgh arrived in the 1820s, drawn by work on the Pennsylvania Canal. These were mostly young, Catholic laborers, taking on the brutal, backbreaking work of digging waterways and laying the foundations of what would become one of America’s great industrial cities. Then came An Gorta Mór — the Great Hunger of 1845 to 1852 — which sent a desperate wave of Irish families across the Atlantic. “During and after the starvation of Ireland, millions of Irish migrated to the U.S. Thousands of those came to Pittsburgh,” Lamb says. “Most were illiterate. The Catholic Church opened many parish schools. Irish parents labored. But their children learned. And the Irish ascended quickly.” That rise was hard-won. In the mid-19th century, Irish immigrants faced fierce hostility from nativist groups who saw them as a threat to American jobs and culture. Anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment ran high, fueled by political factions like the Know-Nothings, who sought to bar Irish Catholics from public office. Yet, the Irish persisted. By the early 20th century, they had risen to positions of power in city government, labor unions, and business. And they never forgot where they came from. Even today, Pittsburgh’s Irish community remains connected to struggles back home. “It is important to recognize the organizations that advocate for the people of Ireland still oppressed,” Lamb says. “The question about the future of the six counties in the north of Ireland under British rule remains unanswered. This attention among Pittsburgh groups is part of what binds the Irish community. It always has.” click to enlarge Mars Johnson Peggy Teets hugs Ruth Macken during the St. Patrick's Day parade in Downtown Pittsburgh on March 16, 2024. St. Patrick’s Day: More Than Just a Party St. Patrick’s Day began as a religious feast honoring Ireland’s patron saint, a fifth-century missionary credited with spreading Christianity across the island. Carried across the Atlantic by Irish immigrants, what was once a quiet day of reflection in Ireland became, in cities like Pittsburgh, a full-throttle display of Irish pride, blending tradition with spectacle in a way only diaspora communities can. Pittsburgh gets a lot right about St. Patrick’s Day: from its historic parade and deep-rooted Irish music to its refusal to let the holiday be just another bar crawl. But stereotypes persist. “My only complaint is with retailers who push the drunken Irish image,” Lamb says. “The tacky T-shirts, the slogans. It’s awful.” Lamb is quick to point out that Ireland has one of the highest per capita rates of non-drinkers in Europe. “We need to stop tagging drunkenness to Irishness,” he says. But when done right, the day is a masterclass in Irish culture. “Music is key,” Lamb insists. “Jigs and reels for dancing, street ballads about the Troubles, even modern acts like U2 or The Cranberries, it all tells the story of Ireland.” There’s all the delicious food, too. Ham and cabbage is a solid staple, though in Ireland, it’s traditionally made with a fattier Irish bacon. Corned beef, an Irish-American twist, became a favorite among immigrants. “I absolutely love Irish soda bread with tea this time of year,” Lamb says. “In Ireland, they’d use currants instead of raisins.” “I stay connected with my Irish roots by celebrating the culture year-round,” Mairin Petrone, Executive Director and President of the Pittsburgh Irish Festival, tells City Paper. “I love listening to Irish music, learning about Irish history, eating traditional Irish food, and helping others do the same.” The Pittsburgh Irish Festival’s Irish Education & Outreach Program hosts concerts, workshops, school assemblies, and more throughout the year to bring Irish culture and traditions to as many people as possible, beyond St Patrick’s Day. The traditions endure, but preserving them can be difficult. “The lack of Irish immigrants presents a big challenge,” Lamb says. “We need to figure out how to attract Irish immigrants to Pittsburgh, like our local leaders did 150 years ago, and 100 years ago, and 50 years ago. We need another wave.” One solution? Strengthening ties between Ireland and Pittsburgh. “We should continue to advocate for a direct flight from Ireland to Pittsburgh. A direct flight generates six times the economic activity between two regions that currently have to rely on connecting flights.” Lamb says. The Irish Cultural Hubs of Pittsburgh Want to step into an Irish pub without looking like a tourist? First, make sure the pub itself passes the test. “An Irish pub must have Guinness on tap,” Lamb says, and should have a selection of Irish whiskeys. The staff should make you feel like you don’t want to leave. And there should be live Irish music.” If you’re heading to an Irish pub for the first time this St. Patrick’s Day, there’s a right way to do it. Order a Guinness, and have patience. A proper pint is a ritual. First, the tulip-shaped pint is tilted at exactly 45 degrees as the stout flows in slow and steady. At three-quarters full, the tap is cut off, and the pint rests. Only after the creamy head forms is it topped off with a slow, straight pour. And of course, there's good Irish whiskey, because, as the saying goes, ‘What butter and whiskey won’t cure, there’s no cure for.’ There are a few don'ts too. Call it Paddy’s Day, not St. Patty’s — or better yet, Lá Fhéile Pádraig. Also, don’t expect green beer. That’s an American gimmick. And whatever you do, don’t yell for your drink. “If you scream at the bartender, you’ll probably just wait longer,” Lamb says. Ready to celebrate? Here's how and where to have the best St. Patrick's Day in Pittsburgh.

By Rachel Wilkinson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Station Square Ask around town and the future of Station Square is, at best, in flux. In the past eight months, three of the riverfront complex’s mainstay restaurants have shut down after operating since the turn of the century. Buca di Beppo closed in June after 25 years, shuttering the Italian chain’s last location in the region. Joe’s Crab Shack followed in September, abruptly closing with no official announcement. And Hard Rock Cafe Pittsburgh, which, for decades, hosted live music ranging from tribute bands to local acts, closed on Feb. 13 after 23 years. The restaurant’s closure came after Brookfield Properties, the New York-based firm that owns Station Square, reportedly decided not to renew its lease. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Hard Rock cafe at Station Square click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Station Square To compound the uncertainty, Brookfield Properties also faces a foreclosure lawsuit, filed in November, demanding more than $140 million in unpaid loans. One news report described the situation as “dismal.” District 2 City Councilor Theresa Kail-Smith, who represents the area that includes Station Square, called the possible foreclosure “a terrible blow to Pittsburgh.” Hard Rock Cafe kitchen manager Matt Byrne, a 15-year veteran who recently created the restaurant’s award-winning Pittsburgh Burger, says management “did this to themselves for whatever is going to happen down here.” Pittsburgh City Paper visited Hard Rock in August, where Byrne and the staff, several of whom had been working at the Station Square restaurant since it opened in 2002, were relieved to have weathered pandemic shutdowns. Byrne describes his reaction to its permanent closure as “not bitter, just disappointed in how this area was mismanaged.” But it’s not all doom and gloom. He says Hard Rock staff in the restaurant’s final days remained “all very grateful for the time spent here and the friends and family we made while having the privilege of working in the area and at the cafe. So that’s the silver lining for us.” Station Square has long held a special place for Pittsburghers. Ensconced in historic buildings, the soon-to-be 50-year-old complex has consistently billed itself as a “premier dining and entertainment destination,” with scenic views of the Monongahela River and incline. Once a social hotspot, Station Square has been the site of weddings, birthdays, proms, and vibrant nightlife with warehouse-style clubs, as well as serving as a potent symbol for Pittsburgh’s postindustrial renaissance. Poised again for transition, Station Square rekindles the questions of what redevelopment in Pittsburgh can be, especially as Downtown, just across the Smithfield Street Bridge, undergoes its own revitalization. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jeff Schreckengost A view of Station Square from the CP office. Karamagi Rujumba, director of education, development, and advocacy at the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, explains that the Station Square we know today began with the death of the passenger rail. The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad was anchored by a grand seven-story station — whose “P&LE RR” sign can still be spotted from Downtown — at the base of the Smithfield Street Bridge. Though the railroad was once known as the “Little Giant” for moving heavy tonnage of steel, coal, and iron ore, by the 1970s, it had declined and operated only one commuter line. The Landmarks Foundation, founded in the 1960s, saw the area could be slated for demolition, as the city had already done in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. “Our organization was really formed in antipathy of what urban renewal was,” Rujumba tells City Paper, noting that swaths of the North Side and South Side had also been marked for demolition. “Our idea was that you don’t have to demolish neighborhoods to reinvest in them, that you can actually use the historic buildings and historic neighborhoods to create vitality by restoring them.” PHLF acquired the 52-acre riverfront site in 1975, establishing the Landmarks Building at the railroad’s headquarters. Rujumba emphasizes their goal was not only to “turn around what was a railroad into commercial, retail, and office space,” but to integrate “artifacts from Pittsburgh’s industrial past.” Station Square’s Bessemer Court was designed to link the site’s riverwalk to its heritage, incorporating a 10-ton Bessemer converter built in 1930. In 1978, PHLF facilitated the creation of the Grand Concourse Restaurant, a significant addition to Pittsburgh’s fine dining scene. The restaurant also modeled historic preservation, repurposing the former train station’s Victorian and Edwardian architecture, marble columns, and stained-glass cathedral ceilings. After 19 years and having achieved its goals, PHLF sold Station Square to developer Forest City Enterprises in 1994. At the peak of Landmarks’ ownership, Rujumba says, Station Square operated 150 businesses, created 3,000 jobs, and generated more than $4 million in tax revenue. “We like to say it’s the shining example of what real urban renewal can be,” he says. One challenge Station Square faces today, says Chris Briem, a regional economist at the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban Research, is that it might be a victim of its own success. “There was an era where it probably didn’t have that much competition,” Briem reflects. When Station Square was created, “you probably could have stood [and] looked up the river and seen the J&L [steel] plant. There was an orange glow on the river. Things were pretty bad. Here was something new,” Briem says. While bars dotted the South Side in the 1970s, the neighborhood catered to workers and wasn’t yet a nightlife destination. The Strip District, then home to a tri-state produce terminal, had fallen into disrepair after Penn Central Railroad filed for bankruptcy in 1970, and had yet to undergo its own transformation. “When the ‘80s came, there's all this great effort to move beyond steel,” Briem tells CP. “We didn’t really do very well, or at least not quickly. So Station Square was kind of an exception to that, a place that people wanted to be.” Briem cites another wave of urban development that emphasized redeveloping Pittsburgh’s rivers (culminating, in part, with a visit by then Prince Charles to the first Remaking Cities Conference in 1988). click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Station Square “You go back 40 or 50 years, we were not using any of these riverfronts,” Briem says. Given all this, Station Square “justified proof of concept” to build out other riverfront retail and entertainment destinations (or so-called “lifestyle centers”) like Southside Works or the North Shore, which now draw its customers. As an urban or pedestrian mall, Station Square also battled with other shopping complexes like the now-defunct Allegheny Center Mall, Briem says. Though Station Square survived while most malls (urban and suburban) did not, it’s been subject to the same retail apocalypse, hastened by the pandemic. Briem also views Station Square’s trajectory as tied to larger shifts in Downtown Pittsburgh, which is still grappling with the rise of remote work and repurposing office space for residential conversion. “No one really planned on COVID happening or this shift happening so fast. And change can be absorbed if it happens slowly enough,” Briem says. “But I think as leases turn over Downtown, you'll see more and more vacancy and more and more property devaluations, which will beget more and more turnover.” Practically speaking, “it’s not actually that easy to get to,” Briem says of going to Station Square from Downtown. “It’s an old joke, because Pittsburghers don't cross bridges … For Americans, it's a complex path.” If you want to hear from an optimist, Thomas Jayson can easily reel off a detailed plan for Station Square’s future. The former club magnate and owner of storied venues including Chauncy’s, Matrix, and Rock Jungle (to name a few) still runs a sports bar in Station Square, Homerun Harry’s. “I see it. I’ve been here. I lived it,” Jayson tells CP. “Been here from day one.” In Jayson’s view, it’s misguided to try to attract foot traffic from Downtown or entice guests to cross a bridge. Though the Smithfield Street Bridge is well-traveled by pedestrians, Station Square should still be thought of as its own destination. “Because it's a great location, it's a safe location,” Jayson says. “You’ve got two inclines that attract a lot of tourism. You’ve got the Gateway [Clipper] fleet down here, which brings in a lot of people. You’ve got [Highmark] stadium; you’ve got everything.” Jayson asserts that the recent restaurant closures weren’t due to a lack of business, but broader issues with the chains’ business models, such that successful locations “went down with the ship.” Even so, as he previously cautioned, novelty is a tricky thing, and he considers Hard Rock’s concept outdated. Conversely, Station Square’s existing restaurants, the Grand Concourse (whose developer Jayson knew), the Melting Pot, and Texas de Brazil are “all doing fantastic,” Jayson says. “That proves it’s a good location.” The biggest challenge currently is “nothing's going to happen until a new owner's in place,” Jayson says, which he believes will be resolved in a matter of months. (The prediction may prove true as Boston-based firm WS Development was reportedly working to buy Station Square last month.) After the complex changes hands, Jayson says, it needs new tenants, and “the effort should be to bring in more restaurants and some entertainment.” The Freight House, once home to the original Funny Bone comedy club and 50 shops, sits empty, save for a vacant medical training center subleased by UPMC. Commerce Corner, where Chauncy’s was, also has occupancy problems. Jayson believes it's still “a great space” that, with upgrades, could attract a national restaurant chain. A new owner could also extend Station Square’s sidewalk to the Sheraton Pittsburgh Hotel (which is owned separately) and attract more guests. Jayson says he’s working on “three or four or five concepts” that could slot in next door to his bar, including a lounge with live entertainment. “They need some cocktail lounges,” he emphasizes. “Not nightclubs like the old days … those days are gone. But I’d open up a restaurant lounge, a cool place to hang out-type place.” Contrary to Station Square’s rumored decline, both Rujumba and Jayson believe there’s room for it to grow, even to build more residential space in addition to the Glasshouse Apartments, developed in 2017. Jayson can envision a hotel near the incline with a “magnificent view.” “A very upscale, five-star boutique hotel would do spectacular there,” he says. “So I think it's going to come back. There's no doubt in my mind, it's not going anywhere,” Jayson says. “I think there is definitely a future here at Station Square, and I think that'll soon be realized.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Community Profile, Station Square, Buca di Beppo, Joe’s Crab Shack, Hard Rock Cafe, Brookfield Properties, Theresa Kail-Smith, Karamagi Rujumba, Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, Chris Briem, Thomas Jayson, Homerun Harry's Related Content Remembering the Pittsburgh Hard Rock Cafe as it prepares to close By Amanda Waltz Jan 31, 2025 ‌This‌ ‌winter’s‌ ‌must-see‌ ‌arts‌ ‌and‌ ‌cultural‌ productions By CP Staff Jan 15, 2025 This Pittsburgh convention gathers area DJs looking for a musical community By Jordan Snowden Jan 10, 2025 CP Year in Review: Staff writer Rachel Wilkinson's favorite stories of 2024 By Rachel Wilkinson Dec 27, 2024 Latest in Community Profile It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 A dig into Leechburg’s history reveals nicknames, costumes, and lots of wishful thinking By Dani Lamorte Feb 19, 2025 The Hill District tower wars highlight a forgotten fight against environmental racism By David S.

According to a woman at my church, located 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, the beast was a “leviathan” — a Biblical-era demonic Nessie. I was 8 or 9 years old, learning to see into a realm that my church said was populated by angels and demons. The other people in town didn’t see what we saw. To them, Leechburg wasn’t filled with invisible spiritual beings, but had ghosts of another sort: floundering mills, empty storefronts, and incomplete legends. The town’s history is filled with the names of people who own or owned property. Some of the owners are well-known and others are almost anonymous, leaving lots of space to speculate. A legendary town founder might be as real as a leviathan. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 While drafting essays for my book on identity and self-discovery, Nobody’s Psychic, I revisited the religious “vision training” I underwent in the 1990s and wondered about its relationship to my life today. As a writer, I’m expected to ground my memories in general historical context, but all I knew about Leechburg was spectral. Lacking information, but possessing a library science degree, I began researching Leechburg’s history in expert fashion: I went to Google and typed “Leechburg history” into the search bar. What returned to me was what I vaguely knew: In 1850, David Leech humbly renamed the town after himself. There were salt mines, railroads, canals, and mills. Bridges, then floods. What is less known, maybe less knowable, is what happened before Leech made himself a burg. In a book commemorating Leechburg's 150th anniversary, Joseph Kantor imagines the area before European settlement as “pristine,” with “sunlight glittering on the Kiski [River], lush forest overhanging the swift current. Game was likely plentiful and the flooding of the river made the soil rich.” He admits, though, this is all fantasy. Even in 1822, only eight white families lived in the area. The area wasn’t far from an Indigenous town of unknown Tribal affiliation, but — by all accounts — no native groups took up the site of Leechburg as a permanent dwelling. One could make the case that native people were using the land even if they didn't live on it. Foraging grounds, fishing shores, and hunting woods all come to mind. But do you have to use something to make it yours? Nobody needed to work the land for the land to be working on somebody. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A green Buick seen in Leechburg, Pa. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 And we want to imagine it, don't we? We, who look like the King's traitorous subjects, want to imagine the land as “pristine,” “lush.” We borrow this desire from the men who arrived on ships and said “It's empty” into the eyes of living people. This desire is where the real emptiness is. Empty like the address bar of a web browser, waiting for its cue. More typing and clicking led me to John Walker, who surveyed the area in 1773. The following year, he sold a portion of the land to Joshua Elder. Nearly 10 years later, Elder reportedly sold that portion to Delaware Indian Chief White Mattock for five pounds, 10 shillings. “Delaware” comes from an honorific title given to colonial Virginia governor Sir Thomas West, known as Lord de la Warr III. When Captain Samuel Argall explored present-day Delaware, he passed the name along in honor of West. Encroachment by and violence from European settlers forced many Unami- and Munsee-speaking Lenape peoples — called “Delaware” by white settlers — towards the western frontier, the area of Fort Pitt and Ohio. Some headed north into New York and Ontario. William Riley Trout, a Leechburg area resident born in 1829, was the first person to report Delaware Chief White Mattock's land purchase. His knowledge was passed along in a 1916 book of local history by T.J. Henry. Henry writes that Trout, “a local historian of note, was of the opinion [that White Mattock] had taken out patents for land after the manner of the white man. White Mattock had taken up the site of Leechburg.” Henry and Trout refer readers to an 1883 text by Robert Walter Smith, which is said to confirm this story. But Smith’s book contains no reference to a Delaware Chief named White Mattock, just a presumably European man named White Matlock. The three history buffs were wrong on several accounts. Their errors open up as doors to another time, to an adjacent America. In the late 1700s, a group of European settlers formed an organization for hyper-patriotic, very American Americans. With no irony in their colonial hearts, they named themselves “The Sons of King Tammany,” later “The Sons of St. Tammany,” after Tamanend — a Lenape leader known to white settlers as “Tammany.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A green Buick seen in Leechburg, Pa. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 Historian Phillip J. Deloria argues that the selection of a Native American mascot like Tamanend wasn't random. White Americans have repeatedly donned Native American costume — literally or ideologically — for political projects. For instance, during the Whiskey Rebellion (1791-1794) a group of white anti-taxation rebels penned a pseudo-declaration under fictitious Native pen names and published it in the Pittsburg Gazette as a message from the “Six United Nations of White Indians.” Tamanend emblematized the “wild” spirit that white settlers hoped would keep government interference in check. They wanted an icon who was a potential menace to “the powers that be,” made from corpuscles of unalienable aboriginal sovereignty. Tamanend, the man, may or may not have seen himself as any of those things. As the Tammanies grew, the Lenape people themselves were pushed further west and north by people who sought to copy them to death. These copyists would dress in “native” garb, smear their faces with paint, and pass a ritual pipe as a sign of brotherliness. A 1798 New York City directory lists the local Tammany chapter’s “sachems” — a term for a traditional Lenape leader (the NYC chapter would later become a byword for the city’s machine politics). Among them was a 53-year-old watchmaker, silversmith, brewer, and steel manufacturer. In 1783, he purchased 192 acres of land along the Kiskiminetas River, right where Leechburg would one day be. His name is inscribed in the land patent books, in that heavily-slanted, thin-lined 1700s script we know from Declarations of things: White Matlack. In a bit of flourish, the scribe crossed not only his T's but his L's, too. The second “a” was left ambiguous. To a quick eye, “Matlack” looks like “Matlock,” maybe even “Mattock.” Property deeds in Leechburg often copied this misread, showing White Mattock as a once-upon-a-time owner. Getting what you want has a way of not lasting. Less than a century after the United States declared its independence, settlers began to worry that the true American way of life was being forgotten. Focused on history, patriotism, and charitable causes, the Improved Order of Red Men “painted itself as a gathering of historians, the worthy keepers of the nation's aboriginal roots,” according to Deloria. Like the Tammanies, they dressed in costume. Unlike the Tammanies, they didn’t think of Native people as a symbol of political power, but as touchstones for a good, old, natural, all-American, meat-eating, firework-firing past that never was. Local chapters of the Order took on “tribal” names and used faux-Indigenous jargon. The Order also revived the legacy of early Tammany members like White Matlack. Between 1875 and 1906, at least two chapters of the Improved Order of Red Men were established in the Kiskiminetas Valley. Somewhere in this timeframe, William Trout told T.J. Henry the tale of Chief White Mattock, Delaware real estate innovator. If Trout, the touted expert on Natives, joined one of those “improved” tribes, it might explain why he told Henry that Matlack-turned-Mattock was a sachem or chief. Matlack was a Tammany, the kind of man that many white men of Trout’s generation idolized: a skilled craftsman, a rebel against the crown, a patriot to his ruin. Trout would have wanted to celebrate Matlack’s story, to place him at the center of town. Perhaps Trout was like me — looking for a Leechburg he never knew, but wished he had. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Seen in Leechburg on Feb. 13, 2025 Or perhaps Trout didn’t even know about White Matlack, but his fantasies took hold in a bit of unclear handwriting. Trout could have read the property records too fast, read “White Mattock” in place of “White Matlack.” “White Mattock,” like “Crazy Horse.” Stereotypes about Native names did the rest. Just describing things, all sparkling, lush, rich. We who look like White Matlack used to imagine a White Mattock to tell us who we are, how we got here. That’s the way of the Tammanies and the Improved Order: fill yourself up with stories from elsewhere, stories you’ve misunderstood. It’s wrong, we now say, and we know it doesn’t work. We’re aware that we’re seeing the Quaker Oats man wearing gemstone turkey feathers from JOANN Fabrics. We see the clipped coupons, the strip mall, and sewing projects-to-be-abandoned. The question — What is Leechburg to me? — disappears behind the whites of town history. But, then, they turn transparent, too. I see the question again. It’s still there. I wanted to know a Leechburg untouched by religious delusion. White Matlack and William Trout wanted to know a perfect America that never went wrong. Centuries apart, we’re still looking for unquestionable origins, but our origins are in the questions themselves, in the need to make an emptiness at the center of our history.

Rotenstein click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The radio tower on the Herron Hill Reservoir in the Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh Sugar Top is the name that Black Pittsburghers gave to the highest elevation in the Upper Hill District neighborhood. Its bungalows, four-squares, and period revival homes were an attractive destination for the city’s upwardly mobile Black middle class in the first half of the 20th century. Moving to Sugar Top from the Lower Hill District became a badge of honor. Sugar Top residents protected their neighborhood from encroachment by urban renewal and land uses they believed would degrade their community. Between 1952 and 1955, homeowners there mounted two campaigns to block the construction of new radio towers in their neighborhood. The battles became forgotten early episodes in a city with a long history of environmental activism. They were among a small number of 20th-century episodes involving Black residents resisting what they perceived to be environmental injustices. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh A suburb in the city “The richer more affluent African Americans [lived in] Sugar Top,” folklorist Hugo Freund wrote of the Hill District history in 1992. “In Sugar Top, the houses are larger, manicured and perhaps designed by architects.” “Sugar Top was a hub within the Hill, but I looked at those people as the elite,” explains barbershop owner Michelle Slater, who grew up in the Hill District. “They were just a little bit, to me, higher class than just basic Hill people.” Slater’s grandmother once lived in Sugar Top with her common law husband, George Harris. George was the brother of racketeer William “Woogie” Harris and photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris. click to enlarge PHOTO: Courtesy Pittsburgh City Photographer Collection via historicpittsburgh.org Herron Hill Reservoir and the police radio tower built in 1955 click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The radio tower on the Herron Hill Reservoir in the Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh It was home to Black lawyers, journalists, business owners, racketeers, athletes, and church leaders. So many pastors lived on the six-block Anaheim Street that it became known as “Preacher’s Row.” Built in 1880, the Herron Hill Reservoir occupies the second-greatest elevation in Pittsburgh and is one of the highest points in Allegheny County. “The outlook from the summit is grand, and the Hill is worthy of a visit,” wrote Pittsburgh guidebook author George Thornton Fleming in 1916. More than a century later, the panoramic view is still spectacular. The reservoir dominates a city park in the heart of Sugar Top originally named Herron Hill Park. The city changed the park’s name in 1984 to Robert E. Williams Memorial Park, honoring the city’s first Black magistrate. By the 1950s, the Upper Hill had become established as the city’s premier destination for Black homeowners. But to city leaders, it was still a Black neighborhood that was fair game for urban renewal. As demolition ramped up in the Lower Hill, Upper Hill residents successfully mobilized to prevent the city from fulfilling urban renewal plans that included leveling 900 acres. “Despite the devastation in the Lower Hill District and Middle Hill District, property values in Sugar Top have not declined,” Freund wrote 40 years later. “Herron Hill and Sugar Top are very different from the stereotyped portraits of ghetto life that so often describes the Hill District.” The tower wars come to Sugar Top After World War II, radio and television towers sprouted in communities across the country. Broadcasters, telephone companies, and the Western Union Telegraph Company bought and rented land to build out new infrastructure. click to enlarge PHOTO: Courtesy Pittsburgh City Photographer Collection via historicpittsburgh.org Herron Hill Reservoir and the police radio tower built in 1955 click to enlarge PHOTO: Courtesy City of Pittsburgh Archives Page from a July 25, 1955, letter from Pittsburgh Public Safety Director David Olbum to the Pittsburgh City Council denying charges that the police radio tower was being built in Sugar Top because its residents were Black Wartime advances in radio technology included microwaves for sending telegrams, long-distance telephone calls and faxes. The Federal Communications Commission also began licensing television stations. Earlier technologies, like the use of radios in police cars, required towers. Broadcasters, telecommunications companies, and local governments saw Herron Hill and Spring Hill on the North Side as prime tower sites. Some communities pushed back against proposed new towers. Opponents testified before zoning boards and lobbied elected officials to prevent what many described as visual blight from encroaching on their neighborhoods. In Washington, D.C., residents of the Tenleytown neighborhood successfully forced Western Union to disguise a new microwave terminal as a silo-shaped building with concealed antennas; the company had scrapped an earlier design to camouflage it as a clock tower. In 1947, KDKA had built a 500-foot tower below Sugar Top near the University of Pittsburgh sports complex. It was far enough away from Sugar Top that there were no reported complaints ahead of its construction. WQED bought the tower in 1953 and replaced it with a 593-foot tower that’s still visible from many parts of the city. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The radio tower on the Herron Hill Reservoir in the Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The radio tower on the Herron Hill Reservoir in the Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh Other towers built inside the city after World War II included a Western Union microwave relay station in Northview Heights, completed in 1946, and television towers in Forest Hills, the West End and South Side. The tower wars arrived in Pittsburgh in 1951 when a contractor for the then-CBS affiliate WJS proposed building a 600-foot tower on Camp Street across from the Herron Hill Reservoir. The Pittsburgh Radio Supply House, Inc., approached city leaders requesting a zoning change to build the tower on Camp Street. Residents from Sugar Top, led by Black attorney and future councilmember Paul F. Jones, successfully defeated the effort, which would have included rezoning part of Sugar Top from “Residential” to “Slope.” After failing to get the necessary approval, the Pittsburgh Radio Supply House company sold its lots to a construction company, which built two homes there in 1955. Another scrap over towers broke out in 1955 when the city proposed building a new police radio tower next to the reservoir. Herron Hill residents complained to city leaders that existing infrastructure was making their neighborhood “look like an Oklahoma oilfield.” Many of the complaints aired in the February 1955 hearing turned on what were described as “sociological factors.” Public Safety Director David Olbum wrote a letter to the City Council in July summarizing the complaints and factors in favor of building the new tower. He vigorously denied that the location was selected because of its proximity to Black-owned homes. Olbum wrote that there was no attempt to “unload this alleged unsightly tower on the Herron Hill neighborhood simply because the population is largely or entirely Negro.” After hearing the complaints, Councilmember and Sugar Top resident Jones temporarily killed the measure. It was revived a few months later after Jones announced that the opposition had been withdrawn. The 75-foot steel tower built in 1955 is still there today. A forgotten history The Sugar Top towers were not isolated cases of local Black environmental activism. In 1965, Lincoln Park residents successfully forced Penn Hills to clean up sewage spills and dumping from East Liberty urban renewal activities in their neighborhood. Longtime Lincoln Park residents also recall that Helen Greenlee, wife of Pittsburgh Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee, bought two lots on her street to block the construction of new broadcast towers there. Historians who have documented Black life in Pittsburgh acknowledge that environmental activism is a blind spot in their research. “The scholarship is sparse on this subject,” Carnegie Mellon University professor Joe Trotter emailed Pittsburgh City Paper in response to questions about environmental history and Black activism. Trotter’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Larry Glasco agrees. “A most important topic but understudied,” Glasco emailed City Paper. “I don't know of an organized environmental movement, but searching the Courier under topic headings like trash, garbage, rodents and the like would turn up a lot of articles of Black residents complaining about unsanitary conditions.” click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The radio tower on the Herron Hill Reservoir in the Sugar Top neighborhood of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Courier columnist Ethel Payne suggested that one reason Black residents bypassed environmental justice issues until the 1970s was that they were used to environmental racism. “Black folks used to laugh at white folks obsession with environmental protection,” Payne wrote in 1977. “Air pollution wasn’t no big thing with us. We’d been breathing bad ghetto air all our lives.” The Sugar Top tower cases are a reminder that Pittsburgh has a long history of Black environmental activism. Some 21st century Pittsburgh residents might call those earlier efforts NIMBYism. Yet, they helped to protect and preserve an important part of Pittsburgh’s history.

Rotenstein click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Lincoln Park homes “They're tearing down these houses,” says Penn Hills resident Wynona Harper. “When they tear down the houses, the lots are not being taken care of and they look a whole hot mess.” Harper is describing what happens when Penn Hills razes single-family homes as part of the municipality’s 50-year-old Townwide Demolition Program. It’s a program that the municipality uses to eliminate what it calls blight, namely deteriorating vacant and abandoned homes in neighborhoods such as Lincoln Park, where Harper lives. Many Lincoln Park residents claim that the program simply removes one nuisance and replaces it with another: vacant overgrown lots. Some Black Lincoln Park homeowners go one step further, alleging that the program is environmental racism because it imposes burdens on the community not seen elsewhere in Penn Hills. click to enlarge 1902 advertisement from The Pittsburgh Press for Lincoln Park real estate Lincoln Park is one of Pittsburgh’s earliest Black suburbs. Between 1900 and 1970, middle-class Black families bought and built homes there. They created a thriving community. But since the 1990s, the neighborhood has become ground zero of the municipality’s inventory of vacant and abandoned homes. It’s one of several Penn Hill neighborhoods that have propelled the municipality into the spotlight as a nationally recognized hotbed of suburban poverty. Sewage spills and dumping in a nearby ravine spurred Black Lincoln Park residents to make environmental racism claims in the 1960s. Back then, civil rights leaders alleged that the municipality sought to displace them. Sixty years later, the conditions are different, but the accusations are the same. Pittsburgh City Paper spoke with current and former Lincoln Park residents, municipal officials, and experts in housing and environmental protection laws. Penn Hills isn’t Detroit or even Pittsburgh, two cities with significant numbers of vacant and abandoned homes. Yet the municipality takes what some residents believe is a path of least resistance to its vacant housing problem, one most frequently associated with the ills of urban renewal: demolition. This article is the first in a two-part series digging into the reasons why Penn Hills has so many vacant and abandoned homes, how the municipality addresses these properties, and why some residents believe Penn Hills’ solution is worse than the original problem. A history of neglect In the mid-1960s, Penn Hills had a mess on its hands. Raw sewage pouring out of broken pipes and debris trucked in from urban renewal demolitions in East Liberty were making life miserable for Lincoln Park residents. The neighborhood had become “a breeding ground for disease and rodents,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported in 1965. “In the renewal debris that is being dumped there, I have seen a whole nest of rats,” one Santiago St. resident who lived near the dumping site told the Pittsburgh Courier that year. The raw sewage and dumping spurred complaints to the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations, federal agencies, and protests at the City-County Building. Some residents believed there was intent behind the conditions. “Apparently they wanted to rid this little corner of Penn Township, where 90 % of this municipality’s Negroes live, of them,” Dr. Charles Greenlee told the Pittsburgh Courier in 1965. Greenlee, a respected pediatrician and civil rights activist, lived in Lincoln Park in a Travella Blvd. home he and his wife bought in 1951. click to enlarge 1902 advertisement from The Pittsburgh Press for Lincoln Park real estate Greenlee is a familiar name to many Pittsburghers — his older brother, Gus, owned the Crawford Grill and the Pittsburgh Crawfords baseball team. Fast-forward 40 years. In the first decades of this century, Penn Hills found itself facing failing infrastructure and a shrinking tax base. The municipality was stretched thin. Decades of deferred infrastructure investment and crushing school-system debt had pushed Penn Hills into what author Benjamin Herold described as a “destructive spiral” in his 2024 book, Disillusioned: Five Families and the Unraveling of America’s Suburbs. According to Herold, Black families in Penn Hills bear the brunt of those problems. Bethany Smith, a Penn Hills resident and one of Herold’s sources, penned the epilogue to his book. “A lot of white folks don’t care for our presence,” she wrote. Penn Hills Mayor Pauline Calabrese disagrees with Herold’s findings and his methods. “In my opinion, his research technique was flawed,” Calabrese wrote in response to emailed questions. “He had a narrative he wanted to push and he went in search of anyone whom he thought would support it.” Herold is only the latest author to dig into poverty and race in Penn Hills. The municipality is the subject of a 2012 Princeton University Ph.D. dissertation, and it figures prominently in the 2013 Brookings Institution book, Confronting Suburban Poverty in America. The earlier books, dissertation, and academic journal articles bypassed the townwide demolition program and the environmental issues in Lincoln Park, focusing instead on other issues. In 2005, Black Lincoln Park homeowners filed another complaint with the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations. The residents had sought relief and answers from Penn Hills officials about the demolition program. Finding none, eight elderly residents who had lived for several decades in Lincoln Park went to the same civil rights commission that earlier residents approached. “For 2003 and continuing to the present [Penn Hills] has intentionally permitted blight and decay to exist in my neighborhood,” wrote the lead complainant. “I believe [Penn Hills’s] actions were due to my race, and the race of my neighborhood[,] African American.” Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations files are sealed to protect the identity of people filing complaints. “Disclosure to a third-party would be against the Agency’s interest in confidentiality in that such disclosure would create a ‘chilling effect’ that would dissuade aggrieved persons from privately seeking assistance,” the Commission wrote in its denial to a Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law request. One of the eight complainants and her daughter agreed to speak with City Paper about the case and the allegations of racism in exchange for anonymity. Five others have died since the complaint was filed. The other two could not be reached. The Commission on Human Relations investigated the complaint for six years and dismissed it in 2011. In its findings, the commission wrote that there was insufficient evidence of unlawful discrimination. click to enlarge 1906 advertisement from The Pittsburgh Post for Lincoln Park real estate Lincoln Park residents then appealed to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which funds the demolition program through the Community Development Block Grant program. They also reached out to the ACLU, the NAACP, and local journalists. “We will be non-existent if the current system of demolishing homes continues,” three residents wrote in a 2012 letter to the NAACP Legal and Educational Fund. “We are desperate for assistance if our community is to survive.” “I wrote to them several times about what was going on. I never got responses,” says Lee, 92, one of the complainants. CP is using her middle name to protect her privacy. Heirs’ properties The Townwide Demolition Program was at the center of the 2005 complaint. “I'd say it's a fairly robust demolition program,” says Penn Hills Planning Director Chris Blackwell. The municipality has demolished hundreds of homes. “I can't tell you the exact number,” says Blackwell. The homes slated for demolition are first condemned. Many, says Blackwell, were abandoned after the last owners died. “Owners are deceased. All you can do is send a violation, but it goes nowhere,” he says. Known as “heirs’ properties,” these abandoned homes are part of a nationwide problem, especially in Black communities. They are a drag on local governments because property taxes aren’t being paid, and they bring down property values and become eyesores. “Heirs’ properties are properties with what's called clouded title,” says Kristopher Smith, a community development officer with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation based in Jacksonville, Fla. “That occurs when the owner of record passes away without a will and the interests in that property are passed down informally to heirs.” Another way titles become clouded is when a will divides property among several heirs. Sometimes those heirs have already died by the time that the owner of record dies. Other times, the heirs simply ignore the property and their obligations to maintain it and pay taxes. A situation similar to this helped lead to the Sept. 2023 shooting that rocked Pittsburgh’s Garfield neighborhood. “This cuts across urban, suburban, and rural markets,” says Smith. “The reality of that is that that's going to overlay with where you see poverty, and that's definitely tilting towards Black and brown folks.” Lincoln Park has both types of heirs’ properties. Responding to complaints by neighboring property owners, the municipality draws from a pool of CDBG funds to hire contractors to demolish the vacant homes and grade the lots. Penn Hills slaps liens on each demolished property to recover costs. The lots are then left untouched by the municipality. “Penn Hills does not have the resources to mow these lots,” read city planning documents. The municipality encourages the reversion to woodlands: “Land is to remain wooded until a development proposal is approved.” Instead of carefully planted grass and trees, the lots fill with weeds, vines, and invasive plant species and become homes for wild turkeys, deer, snakes, and rats. Those vacant lots were the basis for the 2005 civil rights complaint. Though the case remains raw among the surviving complainants, it was little more than a bureaucratic nuisance to Penn Hills government. It yielded no changes to how the municipality conducts its demolitions program. “Nothing,” says Blackwell. “That’s old news,” says municipal manager Scott Andrejchak. “That was resolved. It was adjudicated. It was fully adjudicated.” “‘Environmental racism’ is a defined term,” he adds. “I think it could be in a situation where you have an industrial polluter. It's where you have a public health effect.” To some Lincoln Park residents, the closed case isn’t old news. Vacant lots and abandoned homes left to rot do create public health hazards, according to research by Grounded Strategies. In 2021, the organization issued a report funded by the Heinz Endowments that laid out public health consequences of vacant lots in Pittsburgh. The study found that vacant lots negatively impact community health, mental health, and physical health. “The mental health implications of vacant land are often the result from continuing negative emotions associated with living close to vacant land,” the study’s authors wrote. Vacant land threatens physical health by creating opportunities for illegal dumping and by attracting wild animals. It can also provide cover for criminal activities. Daequan McAdam is an environmental justice organizer with 412 Justice. He defines environmental racism differently from Andrejchak, noting that “there is a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and their quality of life with environmental hazards, whether that be air pollution, water pollution, environmental decision-making.” McAdam says that the demolitions create cumulative impacts. Individual teardowns don’t necessarily impact a lot of people when they happen. But over time, when lots of homes are demolished and the number of vacant lots balloons, that’s when the problems begin. “They are linked to a lot of high rates of different types of illnesses and ailments,” says McAdam. It’s a vicious cycle that is slowly destroying Lincoln Park, house by house. Residents there don’t think it’s a coincidence that their neighborhood bears the brunt of the demolitions program and that disinvestment festers in the once-fashionable suburb. “I'd say a majority would be in the Lincoln Park area,” Blackwell says. “But we demolish structures all over Penn Hills.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Penn Hills planning director Chris Blackwell CP asked Blackwell if there were other demolition hot spots besides Lincoln Park in Penn Hills. “No, that would be the hot spot,” he says. Root shock The effects of the demolitions program are evident throughout Lincoln Park. Overgrown lots are one piece of a neglectful disinvestment puzzle that includes haphazardly patched streets. “After a while, it's just going to be a few houses and a bunch of weeds everywhere,” says Antionette. Her family has lived on Travella Blvd. since the 1950s. She asked that we only use her first name to protect her privacy. “Then it'll be like somebody with an old rotten mouth, a tooth here and nothing else, you know, and then a tooth here. That’s how this will look. A couple of houses and the rest will be land.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Homes slated for demolition along Torrance/Torrens St. Fletcher Hardy lives on Torrance St. next door to a home the municipality demolished in 2023. He’s lived there since 2010. There are two others across the street from his house slated for demolition this year. He supports the demolition program because it eliminates unsafe buildings. The house next door, which had been owned by the family of a decorated World War II Buffalo Soldier (someone who served in an all-Black army unit), was in bad shape. The roof was falling in on the nine people who were living there. Hardy points to one of the houses slated for demolition and says, “That's what it looked like.” Hardy wanted to buy the lot, but couldn’t. It’s heirs’ property, and the municipality doesn’t own it. He didn’t know about the 2005 Commission on Human Relations complaint, but, like the complainants, he’s critical of what happens to the lots once the houses are razed. “I think it's not tearing down the property,” he says. “They don't maintain this main street [Mount Carmel], so grass, bushes take over the whole block where there are no houses.” Hardy thinks Penn Hills simply forgot about Lincoln Park. “They didn't keep up with stuff,” he says. Hardy cites antiquated septic tank systems and auxiliary buildings constructed without building permits. He points to the lot where his neighbor’s house once stood and describes a garage that the municipality’s demolition contractor didn’t remove. He pointed it out to the contractor, who replied that it wasn’t part of the project. “So the garage is still sitting there,” says Hardy. Even the correct name of Hardy’s street seems to have been forgotten. On street signs, it’s spelled “Torrens” — that’s the name that the Torrens Gas Company gave it in 1895. In Allegheny County and municipality records, it’s spelled “Torrance.” The greatest impacts might be the ones that can’t be seen from the road. They appear in the ways that Lincoln Park residents describe their community. These narratives fit a pattern found in other communities where residents have experienced urban renewal and gentrification resulting in displacement that happens in stages. As familiar people, buildings, and landscapes disappear, the residents who remain experience stress. Psychiatrist and urban scholar Mindy Thompson Fullilove describes the responses to displacement pressures as root shock or the trauma experienced when one’s environment is destroyed. “It's the destruction of all or part of one's emotional ecosystem,” Fullilove says. Suburbs are not immune to root shock. “Anybody could have it,” she says in an interview with CP. “We were a very vibrant community,” says Lee’s 65-year-old daughter. She grew up in Lincoln Park and asked that CP not use her name to protect her mother’s identity. “Sometimes when I drive here, it's really upsetting because it's like — like, you see, what, five houses?” Production vs. preservation “If we think about what the cost is to build an affordable housing unit, wouldn't it make much more economical sense to preserve the units that you already have?” says Kim Cutcher, a LISC vice-president based in Toledo. Like many housing experts, Cutcher believes that preserving existing housing stock is key. “There's just not enough resources to wholesale build new, affordable units,” she says. “It's not just preserving the existing housing stock, but it's also providing job opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the community who could learn valuable building trade skills, rehabilitating these homes, and then maybe even move into the homes once they're rehabilitated,” says Cutcher. Cutcher and Kristopher Smith cite land banks and legal avenues to clear titles to heirs’ properties. These routes require access to low-cost civil legal support and long-term strategies, including estate counseling, to remediate the effects of heirs’ properties. The solutions involve creativity and money, two things that appear to be in short supply in Penn Hills. The municipality uses the Allegheny County Vacant Property Recovery Program to get some properties back on the tax rolls, but it’s mainly been used by homeowners to buy adjacent parcels, says Blackwell. Wynona Harper, who has lived in Lincoln Park since 1995, is spearheading a plan to develop five affordable housing units and a community store and garden using the Vacant Property Recovery Program. In October, the Penn Hills Council approved the transfer of eight parcels to Harper for the project. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Deborah Matthews Luckett Travella Blvd. in 1960 click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein A vacant home awaits demolition on Travella Blvd. “So when they took the houses down, I always wanted to do a development in order to help the next person,” Harper says. But Harper’s project is housing production, not preservation. Pennsylvania’s conservatorship law is another route, but it’s also a costly and time-consuming process. “It's a chore, you know, so not a lot of people are willing to do that,” says Blackwell. Meanwhile, it’s demolition season in Lincoln Park. “They usually start the end of the year,” says Hardy. This year’s round includes two Torrance St. homes and one on Travella Blvd. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein No dumping signs posted along Lawton St. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein What was once the home of a Buffalo soldier is now an overgrown lot. All of the demolished Lincoln Park homes had histories. The people who once lived in them were everyday people and Pittsburgh luminaries, like the Torrance St. Buffalo Soldier or the civil rights leader who lived on Funston Ave. or the Travella Blvd. photo studio owner. Before razing the homes, Penn Hills was required by federal law to account for their history — but didn’t. In Part II, CP will explore how those lost histories have contributed to root shock in Lincoln Park. Correction: An earlier version of this article used the term “land trust” to describe a land bank.

Garfield Jubilee is one of several organizations that have worked for years to improve access to housing and workforce opportunities for area residents. \"It put a bad light on Garfield to make people feel that it's unsafe,\" Monroe says, \"and it's not.\" That the shooting started with eviction proceedings wasn't lost on some locals. In the hours and days following the incident, several Pittsburghers took to Twitter to decry what they saw as an unjust attempt to remove William Hardison, Jr. from a house at 4817 Broad St., which Hardison's father sold to an LLC connected to KLVN Coffee Lab owner Will Humphrey. Speaking on behalf of 907 East Street LLC, Humphrey tells City Paper, \"this unexpected and heart-wrenching incident has left us in shock.\" He says the LLC had worked closely with members of the Hardison family to legally acquire the home, and they turned to law enforcement only after failing to find a peaceful way to get Hardison, Jr. to vacate. At one point, Hardison allegedly ignored a welfare check neighbors had called in after witnessing him stockpiling gasoline canisters. As other outlets have extensively covered, Hardison had begun to consider himself a Moorish sovereign citizen in recent years. The result was a firefight that left residents and community leaders shaken and Hardison Jr. dead. A shifting market Once a predominantly Irish neighborhood, Garfield began to suffer from disinvestment during the Great Migration-era influx of Black workers and white residents' departure for the suburbs. Those shifting demographics have left the neighborhood with a mix of owner-occupied homes, rentals in various states of repair, and vacant lots — prime territory for investors who may or may not have the neighborhood's best interests at heart. Some of these investors have sought to capitalize on Garfield's \"up-and-coming\" status and burgeoning arts scene. Monroe says house flippers routinely scout the area for abandoned homes and report unkempt lawns, collapsing garages, and aging roofs to the city. \"Some of the houses that may be dilapidated, [investors] sometimes take advantage of that and purchase those homes, and they're not for the benefit of the community,\" Monroe says. \"They're to benefit themselves in terms of selling houses for $200,000 or $300,000.\" Pittsburgh has a plethora of old and vacant properties that can become a worthwhile investment for those with the money to afford extensive repairs. Humphrey, who has experience navigating the acquisition of derelict houses, says the Broad Street home bore telltale signs of abandonment, including overgrown vegetation, unshoveled snow, and window stickers that indicated a winterized foreclosure — banks or local authorities add these stickers to show that pipes have been drained, utilities cut, and windows sealed. Confirming the house had been abandoned, Humphrey reached out to Hardison's father and other relatives to confirm its availability. They were able to reach terms once it was clear the original owner — Hardison's brother Joseph, who had died in 2021 — hadn't left a will. But it's not just investors attempting to spruce up local homes. Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation (or BGC) has been active in the neighborhood since 1975. BGC's executive director Rick Swartz says deaths in the family, job changes, and inability to maintain properties can all take a toll. \"No two people are facing the same set of circumstances, but increasingly, we're getting calls from people who are having lenders start foreclosure and have nowhere to turn,\" Swartz tells CP. Swartz says many tenants live in substandard housing that continues to rise in cost: \"They're spending 35 or 40% of their income [on rent]; their utilities are high because these homes are poorly insulated, and they find at the end of the month that there's no money for other uses. That's why we've been doing affordable housing [at BGC].\" Though Garfield Jubilee previously worked on public and affordable housing, including Garfield Commons, which is located where the old Garfield Heights high-rise previously stood, BGC has taken the lead on building new homes and renovating older ones. The organization has added 89 new or refurbished rental homes since 2012 and recently constructed 20 homes for owner occupancy that are a mix of affordable and market-rate. Yet market-rate has quickly gotten beyond the reach of the neighborhood's poorest residents. Real estate brokerage Redfin currently puts the median sale price in Garfield at $317,500. Historic rowhouses that once served as working-class housing sometimes retail for more, with one attached brick home a block south of Broad St. listed at nearly $425,500. The homes on either side of the one from which Hardison and police exchanged gunfire have estimated values of $137,000 and $228,700 on Zillow. Inheritance Swartz says there are steps locals can take to keep wealth within Garfield. One of the most important is creating a will. This, on its own, can cost hundreds of dollars, but a will can ensure property stays within a family. The house at 4817 Broad St. hit the market in part because Hardison's brother hadn't left one, and the surviving family members never opened an estate in probate court. Intestacy meant the house went to Hardison's father, who had no interest in keeping the home. Because of this, \"the company that purchased it was able to find his father in Detroit and pay him a rather small sum of money, as well as paying off the mortgage and acquiring the title without any money passing to William Hardison,\" Swartz tells CP. He strongly recommends having a clear will so there aren't lingering ambiguities when a homeowner passes away. Swartz encourages any locals who need help with housing or utility costs to contact BGC rather than try to work things out themselves. BGC has helped neighbors buy groceries and resolve disputes. Both BGC and Garfield Jubilee are active in job training programs, supporting locals who are between careers or struggling to stay on their feet. Garfield Jubilee also offers paths to GED completion as well as training in healthcare and construction. Monroe says construction training, in particular, empowers youth to fix up deteriorating property and helps neighbors see young people as \"resourceful and capable of making changes.\" Both Monroe and Swartz add that stronger local schools would further strengthen the fabric of the community. BGC has worked with 907 East Street LLC in Garfield, and Swartz says the entity has been among the better investor groups active in the neighborhood. Humphrey confirmed to CP that the LLC is currently hoping to put the Broad Street house in an affordable housing land trust, though both he and Swartz say the process of sorting out liens on the home is ongoing. \"Blight is a systemic issue in the City of Pittsburgh,\" Humphrey says, \"and we believed that rehabilitating and repurposing this property could contribute positively to the neighborhood.\" Not everyone agrees that investor groups such as Humphrey's LLC are the best way to make Garfield better for longtime residents. Monroe says she's concerned for \"senior citizens who have been in the neighborhood a long time,\" in particular those whose physical limitations may make upkeep of their properties a challenge. But in the big picture, Swartz and Monroe say legal fixes, opportunities for young people, and more resources on the ground for housing are key to keeping Garfield both safe and affordable. \"I don't think we're going to create a perfect society in Pittsburgh … [but] we have to have a way to get people to housing when needed,\" Swartz says. \"There has to be someone in local and county government focused on these issues.\" He says neighborhoods need to keep an open mind about solutions and that, in the short-term, the city needs more emergency shelters for Pittsburghers experiencing homelessness. Monroe says that even as investors continue to watch the neighborhood closely — one recently inquired about buying her home — the tragedy on Broad Street has gotten community members to have some of these difficult conversations. \"I felt hopeful when I saw residents rallying around to talk about this incident,\" she says, \"because they're looking at what can change, how can we as a community come together, help our community become stronger, and address some of the [problems with] housing and homelessness.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags News, Garfield, housing, BGC, Garfield Jubilee Association, cost of living Related Content Affordable-ish Housing in Pittsburgh: The \"right answer\" edition By Michael Machosky May 10, 2024 Affordable-ish Housing in Pittsburgh: The g-word edition By Michael Machosky Apr 19, 2024 CP Year in Review: News editor Colin Williams' favorite stories of 2023 By Colin Williams Dec 27, 2023 Garfield's \"Thrifty\" store celebrates 30 years as a vital community resource By Jordana Rosenfeld Mar 30, 2023 Latest in News Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

A volunteer-run thrift store in Garfield is celebrating 30 years of service to the community. East End Community Thrift, popularly known as Thrifty, has provided gently used goods including clothing, books, and household items at low prices since 1993. The volunteers who run the store say their mission is about making products affordable and accessible to all. “We keep our prices low so that somebody can come in off the street [and get what they need],” volunteer coordinator Shawna Hammond tells Pittsburgh City Paper during a recent visit to the store. “I had a customer come in and all she had was $3. And I let her know, ‘You can get a shirt or a pair of pants.’ And another one came in and she only had a dollar, but she had something on her shirt, and she needed to change it. And I said, ‘Take the shirt, give me the dollar,’ and she said, ‘Okay, I'll be back.’ That's the way we get our customers.” Hammond, who has volunteered at East End Community Thrift for 28 years, says she was raising a family in the neighborhood when she started out. A few years after it opened, Thrifty considered getting rid of its layaway program. Knowing from experience the importance of being able to reserve an item and pay for it over time, Hammond decided to get involved. The store volunteers found the logistics of the layaway program too complicated, Hammond recalls. “I said, ‘Nope, I’ll come in and work the layaway only,’ and it ended up spreading out to the whole store,” she says. Although they don’t offer layaway anymore, Hammond has become a fixture at Thrifty, taking over store operations after founder Shirley Gleditsch died in January 2022. Thrifty is a project of the Thomas Merton Center, and giving to community members in need has always been the store’s priority. Hammond says Thrifty accomplishes this in part through the store’s voucher program, which is central to its mission. Social service providers all over the city distribute Thrifty vouchers to their clients, which are worth $20 of store merchandise for adults and up to $45 for families. “They can get anything in the store — household goods, clothing, books, toys, anything that they need to feel human,” Hammond says. Hammond says the store is run by a group of about 30 volunteers, 20 of which have regular commitments. In addition to that core group, Thrifty also accepts volunteers from local organizations like KZL Agency, which serves people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, and AARP. Aneesha Esteas, who volunteers at the store through KZL, tells City Paper she likes to come to Thrifty because it gives her a chance to meet new people. Hammond agrees that connecting with others is the most valuable part of her work at Thrifty. “It’s the communication with the customers and getting to know them, getting to be able to understand where they're coming from and their needs,\" she says. In celebration of the store’s 30th anniversary, they’re offering sales on top of their already low prices. For the rest of this week, unscrambling a word jumble on the wall behind the cash register will get you half off your purchase. Next week will be a bag sale where customers pay $5 for anything they can fit in a bag. Hammond says everyone is welcome at Thrifty. “We do get newcomers,” she says, “and we always say ‘Welcome, come back to see us.’ Sometimes we are a little bit over the top with our crazy, but we’re very friendly. We are very into our customers.” East End Community Thrift is located at 5123 Penn Ave., Garfield.

From Monday, Sept. 30 to Sunday, Oct. 6, participants in the inaugural Week Without Driving PGH will avoid driving, instead walking, rolling, cycling, or taking transit or a rideshare to their destination. For those who can’t fully participate, organizers frame this as an opportunity to reflect on the ways the 30% of Allegheny County residents without cars choose to — or have to — navigate the local landscape. “For many people, like the nearly 25% of Pittsburgh households that do not have access to a personal vehicle, life without driving is a daily reality with its own set of challenges,” Julie Walsh, BikePGH’s communications and marketing manager, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “Week Without Driving is an opportunity to highlight those challenges, hear those stories, and advocate for better mobility in all of our communities.” Walsh highlights the ways the challenge can reveal gaps in non-car networks such as bike trails and bus lines. “Does a week without a car sound daunting to you? Think about the reasons why you may feel that way,” she says. “It’s important to think about those barriers and why they exist.” Pittsburgh has made strides in car-free transportation — but advocates still see areas of need, especially given COVID-related service cuts to Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) services. Pittsburghers for Public Transit (PPT), another organizer, recently announced their push for visionary transit and continues to advocate for greater access across all modes of transportation. “The Week Without Driving PGH was started out of organizing within the disability justice movement,” PPT digital organizing director Dan Yablonsky tells City Paper. “People with disabilities are using the effort to give both drivers and non-drivers a wider perspective on their experience and invite them to organize for a system that extends more access to all people.” click to enlarge Photo: Gritstone Media/BikePGH Other organizers and signers-on include Access Mob Pittsburgh, AARP, and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, who will host a press conference alongside Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Week Without Driving organizers on Sept. 30. At least 45 organizations have signed on as co-sponsors. The effort has also released a series of profiles to detail why different participants have gotten involved. Walsh says 35 organizations and 80 individuals and counting had signed on as of Sept. 25. (Full disclosure: as a bicycle commuter and monthly Transit Talk author, I have also signed the pledge.) Studies have shown that ditching driving even part-time can have a major impact on carbon dioxide emissions. One European study found that commuting by bike one day a week reduced individuals’ carbon footprint by up to a half-tonne per year. Walsh says “time will tell” when it comes to measurable impact, but tells CP the community aspect of the challenge is just as, if not more, important. “We urge our neighbors and elected leaders to think about the barriers people face in our current system,” she says. “For some, it’s the lack of safe, accessible sidewalks for walking and rolling, or lack of wheelchair access. For others, it’s the absence of reliable public transit. When we set an intention to take a week away from our cars, we can more clearly see the gravity of these issues and pave the way for solutions.” “Transportation access impacts every part of our lives and communities,” Yablonsky says. “When we improve the transportation system for those with the fewest options, we improve it for all.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Week Without Driving, BikePGH, Julie Walsh, Pittsburghers for Public Transit, AARP, Sara Innamorato Related Content Transit Talk: All aboard the midibus By Colin Williams Feb 18, 2025 Opinion: The 2025 county budget leaves critical gaps in the local justice system By Daylon A.

With Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s Bus Line Redesign underway, it seems the next move may well be downsizing. I’m here to say I support downsizing in our transit — not necessarily in the number of routes or the expansion of headways (i.e., time between stops), but in the size of vehicles themselves. Few U.S. cities can match our steep hills, hairpin turns, and zany intersections. Also, let’s face it: Pittsburgh isn’t some huge metropolis, so it’s highly unlikely, barring a major shift in funding, that we’ll ever have a world-class light-rail system or 10-minute headways on every bus route. But we could make navigating the region easier and more efficient by getting PRT some midibuses. This was one idea from Pittsburghers for Public Transit’s visionary transit member meeting last year that stuck with me the most (thanks, anonymous PPT member). Smaller buses would make navigating Pittsburgh’s tangle of narrow roads much easier. Deployed in a “circulator” model, smaller buses could orbit within neighborhoods, moving local residents quickly between nearby stops and back again. Other cities, including Barcelona, Rome, and Los Angeles already use smaller buses to navigate their narrow streets. Why not us? PRT’s existing hub-and-spoke model makes sense for commuters who live in the suburbs and work Downtown. But for the region’s many seniors who don’t drive (and who often have to wait for ACCESS vehicles), a neighborhood circulator stopping at local shopping destinations might be more practical. This model would also benefit stay-at-home parents, people working from home, and students in neighborhood schools. Rather than routing everyone through Downtown, an East End, South Side, West End, and North Side Circulator would follow a fixed loop within the city’s four loose quadrants. Midibuses would be able to navigate steep streets and parked cars with more ease while also having the right-of-way in busways and dedicated lanes, allowing them to bypass snarled sections of roads such as Liberty Ave. and Sawmill Run Blvd. Circulator buses could be specifically routed to meet local needs, with stops installed at schools, grocery stores, libraries, pharmacies, and parks. These local loops would also take pressure off of tangled routes mainly connecting residents to Downtown — barring some ill-advised national return-to-office movement or an unexpected population explosion, ridership on these routes probably isn’t coming back. click to enlarge Stock A midibus A midibus fleet would mean fewer trips with empty seats and fewer empty seats overall during off-peak hours. Meanwhile, they’d cut down on emissions. Electric midibuses with a 285-mile range were recently rolled out for public transit in Ayrshire, Scotland. Cutting fuel costs would offset the higher per-rider cost of employing drivers on smaller models of bus and cut down on diesel fumes emitted in residential neighborhoods. Smaller buses would also have fewer issues with cars crowding out intersections. At many Pittsburgh intersections, cars stopped at a light have to back up or wiggle to the side to let buses make wide turns. An electric midibus would be able to negotiate a tighter turn without emitting a single gram of exhaust. Regardless of how they’re deployed, smaller buses would be ideal for serving Pittsburgh’s outer neighborhoods. Take the South Side and Hilltop neighborhoods as one example. This area has a growing number of local businesses but comparatively low per capita income. It also has several narrow yet dense business corridors separated by parks, cemeteries, and steep hillsides. The T’s Blue and Silver lines run along the Route 51 corridor here, but the topography makes access a challenge in many spots. Enter the South Hills Circulator. Looping from Brownsville Rd. to Boggs Ave. via the South Busway and Carson St., the circulator would be a boon for locals on Mt. Washington, in Carrick, and everywhere between. Imagine hopping aboard on Brownsville. The circulator would pass near two Shop ’n Saves, two Rite Aids, two major parks, two Carnegie Libraries, and a bevy of food options. You could take the circulator to Fiori’s before hopping on the T for a Riverhounds game or use it for a reading and grocery run while flying past standstill traffic on 51. The circulator would come in especially handy when planned construction makes an easy ride on the T into an hour-long ordeal. There are numerous other use cases for midibuses in the ’Burgh. Night buses for partiers (like the old UltraViolet loop), off-peak buses on regular lines and “flyer” routes, and nimbler shuttles to offset incline closures all come to mind. Regardless, what Pittsburgh needs isn’t a downsizing of transit, but a rightsizing of transit. To maintain existing headways and better serve local neighborhoods, midibuses would be a literal way to do that — just don’t call them “short.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Midibus, Pittsburgh Regional Transit, Pittsburghers for Public Transit Related Content Former employees allege discrimination and nepotism at Pittsburgh Regional Transit By James Paul Sep 30, 2024 Inaugural Week Without Driving PGH highlights transit gaps and community resilience By Colin Williams Sep 27, 2024 Pittsburghers for Public Transit has an ambitious vision for expanded service By Colin Williams Aug 20, 2024 Advocates say $291 million transit plan could bring drawbacks along with faster commuter times By August Stephens Jul 24, 2023 Latest in Infrastructure Inclusionary zoning sparks passionate debate and questions about math By David S.

We led the way with streetcars, with busways, with light rail, with inclines,” PPT executive director Laura Chu Wiens told a packed Olympia Shelter House in Mt. Washington. She said Pittsburgh had “lost our way” when it came to taking bold action to improve transit and that it was time to act as Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) prepares to reevaluate the county’s bus lines. Wiens said this is a rare opportunity to push for change and even expansion of the PRT’s network. “PRT is assessing our whole network of transit service with their bus network redesign and how people are going to move in our region for generations, and we have supportive leaders at all levels, maybe for the first time in history,” she said. “This is a political environment that is ripe for growth.” While the tone of PPT’s party was exuberant, with locals dancing and laughing over Chicken Latino catering while a DJ played in the background, many attendees spoke of the challenges a lack of access to public transit had caused them. Tayveon Kevin Smith, a PPT member who co-authored the organization’s Visionary Service Report, was furloughed from an electrical job at Alstom after inconsistent bus service in the early mornings made getting to work a challenge involving a two-mile walk. Smith told PPT members that poor transit can quickly become a quality-of-life issue — he has multiple children and also takes care of his 90-year-old grandmother. “If transit service ran more often into more places, we would have the ability to be at her side to help her meet more of her basic needs,” Smith said. “It would change the landscape of elder care here in Allegheny County.” He said better transit would enable more economic mobility and free up valuable time for education and recreation. “Visionary transit will open … parts of the county where people like me, my grandmother, like my kids, like all of you, my friends in the service sector, like our friends with disabilities, can afford to live and to work and to play and not sacrifice our time, our safety, our relationships and our dignity,” Smith said. Fred Mergner, a retired bus operator and service planner for what is now PRT, agreed. “A robust transit system will serve the needs of the people by providing access to all the county has to offer,” he said. “Particularly important is access to education and employment opportunities, to food and to medical care. All county residents need convenient access to these things.” Mergner and others said PRT’s cuts added up to around a 40% reduction in service over the past decades, leaving Allegheny County with less dependable connections and, in some regions, no transit at all. Mergner says expanding the local network could create jobs and ultimately benefit the environment, something that dovetails with PRT’s plan to have a zero-emissions fleet by 2045. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams Former transit service planner and PPT member Fred Mergner addresses the organization's members on Aug. 14 Wiens said that, in concrete terms, visionary transit is largely about frequency and consistency. “Here are the specifics: One, every resident in Allegheny County should have access to public transit within walking distance of their home,” she said to applause. “Number two: All buses and trains should come … every 30 minutes, with 15 minutes’ headway for higher-frequency lines … Lastly, transit should run at least from 4:30 in the morning, and we think there should be 24-hour service in a lot of highly active locations.” Wiens said this plan emerged directly from their work in the community as well as data on service requests in PRT’s system. In addition to the broad-strokes steps Wiens, Mergner, Smith, and others outlined, PPT also solicited more ideas from the audience using a vision board. Those in attendance suggested a number of changes, including an end to fare, clockface scheduling — where buses arrive at the same times each hour — and the purchase of smaller vehicles for less populated areas. PPT is planning to push harder for visionary transit service in coming months. Wiens said the organization will have a cost estimate for their plan soon so PPT membership can approach elected officials with specifics. She expressed optimism about Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato and Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey’s willingness to support sweeping change for the benefit of local residents. “The last bus runs too early for downtown hotel workers, for nurses in Oakland, for our favorite bartenders in the Strip,” Wiens said. “What we are putting forward for today is something that reflects a long-term trajectory of riders of the community saying we deserve better.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Pittsburghers for Public Transit, Laura Chu Wiens, Tayveon Kevin Smith, Fred Mergner, Pittsburgh Regional Transit Related Content Transit Talk: All aboard the midibus By Colin Williams Feb 18, 2025 Former employees allege discrimination and nepotism at Pittsburgh Regional Transit By James Paul Sep 30, 2024 Inaugural Week Without Driving PGH highlights transit gaps and community resilience By Colin Williams Sep 27, 2024 Advocates say $291 million transit plan could bring drawbacks along with faster commuter times By August Stephens Jul 24, 2023 Latest in Infrastructure Transit Talk: All aboard the midibus By Colin Williams Feb 18, 2025 Inclusionary zoning sparks passionate debate and questions about math By David S.

Sascha Craig had worked for Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) for over 30 years when the organization attempted to fire him in 2020 for illegally claiming less than six hours of overtime. He claimed it was for challenging a COVID-era uniform policy that prohibited him from wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask while on the job. \"They just wanted to punish me and hold me off of work for as long as they could. So yes, there is retaliation, and yes, it is racially motivated,\" Craig said at a press conference. Craig, a former bus driver trainer, is one of roughly 60 former PRT employees making up the Coalition of Concerned Transit Workers who claim that Allegheny County's largest transit agency is rife with discrimination, nepotism, and cliquishness that results in preferential treatment for white employees and repercussions for those who speak up. A handful of the coalition’s members, including Craig, aired their complaints at a press conference Friday morning before entering the PRT's monthly board meeting to express concern directly to the organization's heads. PRT, formerly the Port Authority of Allegheny County, stands by its prior employment and disciplinary action, including termination, according to an emailed statement sent to Pittsburgh City Paper by PRT Deputy Chief Communications Officer Adam Brandolph. PRT employs 2,600 people to provide transit across Pittsburgh and Allegheny County and is operated by an 11-member board, according to the county and federally funded organization's website. At the press conference near PRT's Downtown headquarters, Craig detailed how, at the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, he wore his Black Lives Matter face mask on the job for months without complaint. When Port Authority implemented a policy in July 2020 banning political masks, Craig, two other employees, and the union representing them sued PRT. Two days after Craig testified in federal court on Nov. 10, 2020, he says PRT attempted to fire him for timesheet fraud. \"If you don't think that [PRT]... is vindictive, I'm a prime example,\" Craig told the board members inside the morning meeting. \"I implore you to launch an investigation on the disparate treatment that your African American employees and your female employees, to a certain extent, receive from this company.\" click to enlarge CP Photo: James Paul Board members prepare for the Sept. 27 PRT board meeting. Chaz Williams, the chairperson of the coalition and a former bus driver for PRT, said he joined the alliance after he alleges he was fired as the result of racist and retaliatory internal practices. Williams says that in 2021, he got into an altercation with a pedestrian crossing at a red light. Williams says that the pedestrian, who happened to be the friend of the former PRT Chairman Jeffrey Letwin, leaned on his connections to have him fired. \"We are the victims who are punished for matters other than our actual job performance. You have a serious problem dealing with the Black employees, and it needs to be addressed and brought to a resolution.\" Beyond racial discrimination, another member of the coalition claimed they were terminated after seeking federal intervention when they were passed over for a job in what they view as a clear case of nepotism. PRT did not address the specific circumstances of any of the claims. Darnell \"Shelly\" Alston, a former employee of PRT's human resources department, says she was near-guaranteed a position hiring bus drivers in April of 2022. But while she was in the hospital for medical leave later that month, she says she learned the position had gone to the department manager's son. Alston filed a complaint to the Pittsburgh Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Sept. 2022 and received a right to sue in May 2023, according to documents obtained by Pittsburgh City Paper. Alston says she was fired less than two weeks later for \"poor performance.\" Alston says she should have known. When she started at PRT in 2020, Alston noted an employee relations associate told her, \"Whatever you know about HR, it doesn't apply here.\" \"When you're in an abusive relationship, you feel like things will get better, and so you stay,\" Alston says. \"But then you find out that they're not going to get any better.\" Alston filed a lawsuit against PRT in July. It's one of four federal suits former employees filed against PRT since 2021, alleging racial, religious or medical discrimination. Brandolph with PRT said the organization requires annual employment opportunities and unconscious bias training for all employees and intends to implement additional training for managers and supervisors later this year. \"PRT acknowledges that while we all hold unconscious beliefs, they should never play a role in employee discipline,\" the statement read. It did not address the lawsuits in response to CP's questions. Craig was reinstated in his position after suing, along with two other employees, over the organization’s mask policy. He retired later in 2020, and while he says he's happy to be out, he wishes his more than three decades of employment with PRT didn't end the way it did.

Rotenstein click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Pittsburgh City Councilor Bob Charland listens as Troy Hill resident Valerie Allman testifies against his bill. The future of affordable housing policy in Pittsburgh could be decided in a battle between two competing views of inclusionary zoning (IZ). One side, represented by Mayor Ed Gainey’s proposal to extend IZ across the entire city, says that this approach will increase the supply of affordable housing. The other side, represented by City Council member Bob Charland’s legislation for limited IZ, says it won’t. Advocacy group Pro-Housing Pittsburgh says IZ can actually have the opposite effect. The proposed approaches to solving the city’s affordable housing crisis collided last December in a contentious Pittsburgh City Planning Commission meeting. The Planning Commission deferred a decision on IZ to its Jan. 28 meeting. Last week, the Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group released a study calling for mandatory IZ across the city. It supports the Gainey proposal and is critical of Charland’s bill and the Pro-Housing Pittsburgh data used to it. Whether or not IZ works and is implemented citywide could come down to which camp’s math and data are better. Fuzzy math Local governments use IZ to require developers to set aside a percentage of units as affordable when certain conditions are met. Pittsburgh introduced IZ in 2019 in Lawrenceville. The city expanded it to Bloomfield, Polish Hill, and much of Oakland. In those neighborhoods, developers who want to build 20 units or more are required to include 10% of them as affordable. Founded in 1988, PCRG is a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. Its member groups include community development organizations and community service groups. Its staff includes researchers and analysts with expertise in public policy and housing and a board of directors composed of CDC leaders and community group executive directors. Pro-Housing Pittsburgh is a volunteer activist and political lobbying group founded in 2022 to promote the production of more housing in Pittsburgh. They’re part of a larger nationwide YIMBY movement: Yes In My Back Yard. YIMBYs want to remove local regulatory barriers that they perceive as impediments to producing more housing. Pro-Housing Pittsburgh has been effective in turning out members to testify in public hearings to support proposed new development projects, such as the Pittsburgh Irish Center, and to oppose historic preservation efforts. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein People waited for hours to testify in a basement room during the 11-hour Planning Commission hearing. Last March, the group began compiling data for a report it released in December, the same day that Charland introduced his IZ bill. Jack Billings, an economics graduate student, and David Vatz, whose LinkedIn profile says he works as a tech firm account executive, wrote the 21-page paper, “The Effects of Inclusionary Zoning on New Housing Construction in Pittsburgh.” Vatz founded Pro-Housing Pittsburgh and Billings became an early leader. The Billings and Vatz paper claims that IZ doesn’t reduce rents and inhibits new housing construction. They used building permits data pulled from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) and used statistical analyses to demonstrate that IZ doesn’t work. “Unfortunately, the data that they took was from WPRDC,” says PCRG’s Druta Bhatt, one of the new report’s authors. “This particular dataset that's coming from the City is notoriously inaccurate.” Lawrenceville United Executive Director and PCRG report co-author Dave Breingan agrees. He says that Billings and Vatz should have checked their data against other sources. “Simple Google searches would have fixed it,” he says. The WPRDC data have lots of gaps and errors. “Through no fault of their own, it’s a tricky dataset to use but they don't acknowledge that,” says Breingan. “It's challenging to use for all kinds of different reasons. It just doesn't have the accuracy and precision of data that researchers would love to have.” But the numbers aren’t the only problem with the Pro-Housing Pittsburgh report. University of Pittsburgh housing researcher and former Planning Commission member Sabina Dietrick says that it ignored lots of variables other than mandatory IZ that affected housing production in the period covered by the Pro-Housing Pittsburgh report. “Something really big happened in 2022,” Dietrick explains. “Interest rates skyrocketed … the authors don't talk about interest rates and how that affects development and housing,” says Dietrick. Another flaw, says Dietrick, is the amount of buildable land in Lawrenceville. “The authors don't talk about available land and available properties. You can't build new housing if you don't have the lots,” she says. The Pro-Housing Pittsburgh report is so flawed that multiple area housing experts and economists declined to speak about it on the record. “I shared it with a couple of economists that I know and they were very dismissive of it, like [they] thought it wasn’t even worth talking about,” says Breingan. “One of them told me, he’s a professor, that [Billings] would fail in undergrad for turning in that regression model that they have included in there.” “There really is not sufficient data yet to attempt the analysis at the core of the paper,” says Pitt economist Chris Briem. “That would be true in any circumstance, but the timeframe we are talking about includes a lot of events that have significantly impacted development locally and nationally.” The Pro-Housing Pittsburgh report looks like a piece of well-researched academic scholarship. It has footnotes, charts, complicated mathematical formulas and all the minutiae found in peer-reviewed academic journal articles: an abstract, keywords, and a set of Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Pittsburgh Planning Commission member LaShawn Burton-Faulk listens to Council member Bob Charland’s presentation. Billings admits that the report wasn’t peer-reviewed, in other words, experts in housing and economics didn’t formally evaluate it. “This is not even what I would call a working paper in economics yet,” says Billings. “It's not been formally peer reviewed in the sense that I have not presented it at economic seminars. I would not present it at an economic seminar at this stage. We simply do not have enough data right now.” Though Billings concedes that the paper isn’t complete and is something he wouldn’t consider publishing or even presenting at an academic conference, Pro-Housing Pittsburgh did distribute it widely to the press and to public officials like Charland. Councilmember Barb Warwick thinks that’s a problem. “[Billings] is using it to move policy in the city of Pittsburgh,” she says. “He's using it to move policy yet it is something that is essentially just some numbers that they were able to pull together looking at PLI records.” “This wasn’t a strategy to put out good data or to have a fair reckoning of a complicated policy,” says Breingan. “It was to advance a position that they had already made months prior that inclusionary zoning is bad and it's going to depress housing.” “I always use the word ‘disingenuous,’” says Warwick. Shortly after PCRG released its report, Vatz emailed Pittsburgh City Paper, “The PCRG report is extremely misleading in the way it presents [inclusionary zoning] as being a success, and includes many factual errors.” Dueling statistics Before Tuesday’s Planning Commission meeting about IZ, Pro-Housing Pittsburgh released a revised version of its report. “We have published an update to our original report which corrects errors and addresses common criticisms and questions,” reads a release the group distributed shortly after midnight Monday. The updated report includes new data and new building projects, but the methodology critics slammed in the earlier version remained unchanged. The new report still compares Lawrenceville with the South Side Flats and the Strip District. It also doesn’t include other factors such as mortgage rates that economists and housing experts say are essential to studies like this. “Their search for data in support of their political position continues,” Breingan wrote in an email to City Paper after the revision’s release. “I don't think the authors have proven themselves to be capable, unbiased, or responsible researchers and their data should be regarded with extreme skepticism until it can be properly vetted.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein People lining up waiting to testify before the Planning Commission. A marathon 11-hour Planning Commission hearing on the competing IZ bills included more than 5 hours of public testimony on Charland’s bill by more than 75 people, including 21 on Zoom. Zoning Administrator Corey Laymon recommended that the commission send a negative recommendation of Charland’s bill to the City Council. Planning Commission Chairperson LaShawn Burton-Faulk cut off Charland’s presentation that included 130 slides and a virtual presentation by UCLA housing scholar Shane Phillips. Burton-Faulk said that Phillips was presenting data not relevant to Charland’s bill. Most of the testimony by community groups, people from many Pittsburgh neighborhoods and At-Large County Council member Bethany Hallam assailed Charland’s bill as a give-away to developers and as bad for the city. Testimony in favor of Charland’s bill included members representing Pro-Housing Pittsburgh and Council member Anthony Coghill. The Planning Commission voted to not recommend Charland’s bill to the City Council. After a brief break, the commission took up Gainey’s citywide IZ proposal and voted to recommend it to City Council. Both bills will go to the City Council for additional hearings and votes. At some point the battle over contested data and research methods is going to move out of hearing rooms and City Council chambers and into Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods. If nothing else, the fight over IZ is a good reminder students get in math classes: check your work before turning it in.

The event was held at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers building on the South Side. Committee members walked to the back of the building on a path surrounded by tables promoting candidates, with some handing out small items such as pins and customized can openers. In a historic turn of events, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey narrowly lost the county party's endorsement vote to Corey O’Connor 270 to 274. The margin was so slim that the Democratic Committee offered to perform a recount on March 10. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey Gainey touted his administration’s accomplishments when asked about his motivation for running again. “I love the city and I love what we've been doing in the city. I love the fact that we're able to talk about it from a public safety standpoint,” Gainey said. “We reduced homicides [of] children from [ages] 13 to 17 in 2024.” Gainey also highlighted his administration’s work on affordable housing (including $30 million in an affordable housing bond), investments in Downtown, and upgrades to the city’s fleet of vehicles. Allegheny County Controller and mayoral candidate Corey O’Connor said he decided to run for mayor because, “I think Pittsburgh deserves better … Right now, we have a mayor that's managing our decline, not even being able to hire chiefs of police, department heads are leaving left and right. Nobody wants to be part of the administration, [we’re] losing population, our unemployment is the second-worst in the country — so Pittsburgh deserves better.” O’Connor cited his extensive experience at city and county government in making a case to potential voters. O'Connor and Gainey have recent locked horns over fundraising and policy. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Corey O'Connor greets supporters on Mar. 9, 2025. In the race for the eight available Court of Common Pleas judicial seats, the endorsed candidates included Pa. Rep. Dan Miller, Julie Capone, Quita Bridges, Matt Rudzki, Anthony DeLuca, Heather Bresnahan, Jaime Hickton, and Amanda Green-Hawkins. Miller and DeLuca both spoke about their work with mental health in the judicial system. DeLuca, a labor union lawyer, said, “I was part of the small team that developed the mental health court in Allegheny County and I want to continue that work as a judge.” Miller said he would bring “a lot of disability and mental health work” to the bench: “Unfortunately, that is what is in the courts. So in many [cases], you’re talking family [courts], criminal [courts], and Orphans’ Court. There’s a big issue with disability and mental health … [and the] application of law to that population.” Julie Capone, a candidate with experience as a prosecutor in the elder abuse division, said “When I was 15 years old, I was an aide to the nurses' aides. I saw a lot of things that happened in the Alzheimer's unit. I saw a lot of good workers, but there were a lot of traumatic things I saw happening. I carried that passion when I went to law school and worked in the elder clinic at Pitt, and I did pro bono work there and did any legal services for seniors that couldn't afford it, so I carried that on to the district attorney's office when they created the elder review unit.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Corey O'Connor for Mayor Kim Salinetro, an aide to current city councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith, won the endorsement for City Council district 2. Kail-Smith announced her retirement in Dec. 2024, suggesting that Salinetro take her seat on city council. Allegheny County Council has a historic six seats open in areas ranging from Moon Township to the Mon Valley due to council members retiring. Three of those seats were unopposed, while the other three were contested in County Council Districts 1, 3, and 9. Kathleen Madonna-Emerling of Moon Township was endorsed for County Council District 1, which includes townships from Findlay Township to Ohio Township. Lissa Geiger Shulman of Hampton Township received the endorsement for District 3, which encompasses townships from Aspinwall up to West Deer Township. Aaron Adams of Duquesne won the endorsement against three other opponents for District 9, which encompasses large swaths of the Mon Valley. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A union voter attends ACDC's Endorsement Day Bethany Hallam, the Allegheny County Councilor at Large representing the entire county, described the county council race as an open one. “We have seven openings on the County Council right now,” she said. “Six of those are being voted for in today’s Allegheny County Democratic Committee endorsement. One of those seats is a minority seat, so it cannot be a Democrat because I am the Democrat at Large. That seat will be decided in the Republican primary. The other six seats include three seats being vacated by the retirement of council members. That’s council members Betkowski, Prizio, and Macey.” “These are the most vacancies we have ever had in a County Council election, ever,” Hallam added. “So it’s potentially going to be a big shake up on council, either for good or for bad, depending on who wins these races.” The primary election will take place on May 20, 2025. Voters registered as Democrats are eligible to vote in the Democratic primary while voters registered as Republicans are eligible to vote in the Republican primary. Independent voters are not eligible to vote for major party candidates in the primary due to Pennsylvania’s closed primary system.

Following national news reports about Republican donors courting his Democratic primary opponent and Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey reaffirmed his relationship with community advocates and admonished what his campaign calls MAGA funding. “This May, we have a choice to make again, and I believe I know just what our city is ready to say and do: Hell no to Trumpism and making sure that we reject opponents’ MAGA-backed campaign,” says Gainey at a Mar. 3 press conference. A piece from The Guardian published early Monday morning detailed maximum donations from several Republican donors, such as J. Clifford Forrest and Herb Shear, as well as O’Connor’s attendance at a private social club meeting organized by a trustee of Commonwealth Partners, a right-wing non-profit associated with billionaire and big-time Republican donor Jeffrey Yass. The O’Connor campaign told The Guardian that the candidate “spoke about his record of progressive reform and his plans to make housing more affordable, expanding before and after school programming, and reopening [recreation] centers” during the meeting. Hours later came an article from The Intercept that tallied GOP donations for O’Connor’s campaign at more than $130,000 — more than a fifth of O’Connor’s total fundraising in January. An O’Connor spokesperson also told The Intercept that the county controller holds progressive values and added that “he cannot and will not be bought by anyone.” In a phone interview with Pittsburgh City Paper, O’Connor flatly denied the accusation from the Gainey campaign that he is bought by MAGA and said the attack “shows desperation in the mayor’s office.” He also said that Gainey has received donations from Republicans too. “To me, it’s a joke from a campaign that is running scared,” O’Connor says. “They’re not talking about citywide issues.” O’Connor’s team shared with City Paper and other outlets a document asserting Gainey received more than $82,000 in donations from Republicans, including Forrest. The vast majority of the donations listed, including from Forrest, came in 2021 after Gainey’s primary victory against former Mayor Bill Peduto. (Gainey, like all recent Democratic Mayors, easily won the general election.) O’Connor also criticized Gainey for suggesting Pittsburgh as a possible location for the Republican National Committee last year. At the press conference, a reporter asked Gainey about these points by O’Connor. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Mayor Ed Gainey addresses the media during a press conference regarding Corey O'Connor's campaign funding on Mar. 3, 2025. “I don’t believe the Republican National Convention came here, that’s number one,” Gainey responded. “Number two is, that was four years ago, in a general election, when we were talking about building bridges … so that we can make sure that we have a strong economy.” In a statement provided to CP, a spokesperson for Gainey’s campaign described Forrest’s donation as an “oversight” and said on Friday a check had been mailed returning the full amount of the donation. The campaign also provided a statement from its treasurer Jonathan Mayo, who said that Gainey and O’Connor’s donations are apples and oranges. “We’re not talking about business owners who donate to local candidates of both parties, or moderates who give to moderates in both parties,” Mayo said. “We're talking about the MAGA advisors who got Trump elected and the millionaires who are bankrolling the MAGA movement working to elect O’Connor as part of a national effort by Republican operatives to challenge mayors who stand up to Trump in Democratic primaries.” Gainey, alongside several advocates of various social issues, spoke at QMNTY Closet, a free resource for clothing and other necessities for LGBTQ people operated by the QMNTY Center. About 40 people clustered in a small room with shelves of clothing on one side and racks on the other. For the bulk of the press conference, Gainey stood by as advocates not directly a part of Gainey’s administration spoke in support of the mayor and against O’Connor, following a familiar strategy from the mayor that highlights diverse voices across Pittsburgh’s communities. Monica Ruiz, the executive director of Case San José, a non-profit that advocates for the Latino community, opened the press conference by summarizing and responding to the news. Ruiz described the Republican funding of O’Connor as part of a larger, Trump-flavored rightwing movement. “Trump’s people know Pittsburgh won’t elect a Republican, so instead, they’re pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of attack ads lying about Mayor Ed Gainey’s record into our Democratic primary on behalf of a candidate they think will be easier to influence, because they know damn well that Mayor Gainey will never bow down to MAGA,” Ruiz said. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Monica Ruiz-Caraballo addresses the media during a press conference regarding Corey O'Connor's campaign funding on Mar. 3, 2025. Additionally, Chauntey Wilson, a transgender healthcare worker, spoke about anti-trans discrimination and the hope Gainey gives her, Nev Jones, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, spoke about the termination a week ago of a grant for Social Security Administration-funded research into potential barriers in the workforce for Pennsylvanian with disabilities, and Jenise Brown, a United Steelworkers organizer, touted the City of Pittsburgh’s recently launched “Keep Pittsburgh Home” affordable housing initiative. Tanisha Long, a progressive activist and organizer for the Abolitionist Law Center, attended the press conference and told CP that she found it to be a clear message. “When I look at the mayor’s race and what I value, I do look at where the money comes from,” Long said. “That’s important to me. And I don’t believe that you can take that amount of money from MAGA donors and not owe them something.” O’Connor has massively outspent Gainey in the campaign so far, and a recent report from Axios referenced an internal poll showing O’Connor leading Gainey by 12 points. Long said she believes Gainey to be competitive and pushed back on the notion that the election looks dire for Gainey. “I think that it’s been artificially inflated to look like a tough primary,” Long told CP. “I think what [O’Connor] did was he came out hard and fast with a lot of these big money, developer, MAGA, corporate donations to make it look like [Gainey] didn’t have a fighting chance, when, in reality, he’s got the same community support he did before, he’s been doing some great things, and when you have that amount of money, you have the ability to drown out the voices that are doing the work.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Ed Gainey, Corey O'Connor, Jeffrey Yass, Clifford Forrest, Monica Ruiz, Tanisha Long Related Content ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Mayoral candidates point fingers on developer donations and affordable housing By Colin Williams Mar 10, 2025 After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Gainey, O'Connor clash on housing and Pittsburgh's budget in weekend debate By Laura Trybus Feb 3, 2025 Latest in Politics ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Mayoral candidates point fingers on developer donations and affordable housing By Colin Williams Mar 10, 2025 Trump’s policies and avian flu are driving egg prices up — and begetting plenty of memes By Colin Williams Mar 5, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

Trump is the U.S. President again — with lots of help from wealthy Americans. Even tech executives once critical of the mercurial president have hastened to kiss the ring. Now expecting tax cuts and deregulation, the country’s deepest-pocketed individuals, financial firms, tech companies, crypto outfits, and others recently lined up to contribute a record $200 million for Trump’s inauguration. Several Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh-area figures counted among the 45th and 47th President’s most generous financial supporters during the campaign cycle. It’s impossible to say whether they’ve donated to Trump’s inaugural fund as the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc. hadn’t filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by press time. However, political contributions during the campaign are public, and these give a hint as to the locals who are especially excited about Trump’s return to power, even if some of the below donors hedged their bets with a few donations to Democrats. The following totals were sourced from a combination of FEC records, news reports, and data compiled by watchdog site OpenSecrets. click to enlarge CP illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Mellon baller: Though he now lives in Wyoming and spent his childhood mostly on the East Coast, Timothy Mellon is fabulously wealthy due to his status as a scion of one of Pittsburgh’s most illustrious families. Mellon, like others of his lineage, has also been a staunch supporter of Republican causes for decades. He came second only to broligarch-in-chief Elon Musk in largesse this election cycle. Though first a supporter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mellon, like others, fell in line behind Trump and spent the GDP of an island nation reelecting a twice-impeached felon to the highest office in the land. He also spent the maximum allowed to help reelect Republican Representatives including firebrands Byron Donalds (Fla.) and Lauren Boebert (Colo.). (Total contributions: $172 million) Yass, queen: No Pennsylvanian has matched the magnanimity of Philly-area multibillionaire Jeff Yass. Yass donated many millions to various Republican PACs, candidates, and state Republican parties inside and outside the commonwealth this election cycle. Intriguingly, he’s also a stakeholder in TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, through his own shares and his trading firm Susquehanna International, and he has sought to persuade Trump not to ban the popular app. Yass and his wife, Janine, together, were the sixth-largest personal contributors to rightwing causes in 2024. Purely in numeric terms, there’s a vast gulf between Mellon, Yass, and the remaining super-spenders on this list. (Total contributions: approx. $100 million) Donors Dave and Dina: In addition to running a successful bid for Senate, Dave McCormick and his wife Dina Powell McCormick, herself a former Trump appointee and a financial executive, spared no expense in electing their fellow Republicans. Both our newest Senator and his wife spread their wealth far and wide, donating to local candidates, state Republican party organizations, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), often in $10,000 increments. A sizable part of this appears to have been spent funding Dave’s own campaign — he and Dina spent at least $1 million of their hard-earned Bridgewater and Goldman Sachs cash on unseating Democrat Bob Casey. Second time’s a charm! (Total contributions: $2.2 million combined) Standing Tull: Like the McCormicks, Edgeworth resident Thomas Tull spread the love around during the 2024 cycle, donating to candidates and groups across the country. A billionaire former entertainment executive-turned-investor, Tull once donated $1 million to elect Hillary Clinton. This past cycle, however, he donated to numerous Republican causes across the country (including $500,000 in 2023 to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s Protect the House 2024 Super PAC) while kicking in the maximum allowable donation for N.Y. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House Minority Leader. (Total contributions: $1.1 million) EQT for the GOP: Among the charitable contributors to Republican causes in Western Pa. is the EQT Corporation. The “vertically integrated American natural gas company” gave $300,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund, which, per its website, “has one goal: to build a Republican Senate majority.” EQT also splashed out $50,000 for Team West Virginia, an Alexandria, Va.-based PAC that skews conservative. Balancing this out a bit was a $5,000 donation to the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association, which makes some sense given Pa. Lt. Gov. Austin Davis’ past support of tax credits for petrochemical firms. (Total contributions: $350,000) Other high rollers: Several other area residents donated over $100,000 to conservatives. Concast Metal Products Co. president Al Barbour and his wife, Mary, appear to have donated almost $650,000 combined to Republican causes. The Calandra family, who lead local manufacturing company JENNMAR, donated nearly $600,000 to various Republican PACs and candidates. Kent McElhattan, a Pittsburgh foundation executive and venture capitalist, made significant donations to the NRSC, McCormick’s campaign, and other conservative PACs totaling $440,000. Rounding out the high rollers list is Gabe Hudock, an aluminum executive, who donated over $150,000 to Republicans in 2023 and 2024, and health philanthropist Nick Beckwith, who donated over $100,000 to Nikki Haley’s failed Presidential campaign, as well as McCormick and several Congressional candidates. This is far from an exhaustive list of major donors, but all told, these donors alone contributed over $270 million to the most expensive Presidential election in history. It’s perhaps ironic given Trump’s strong base of support among rural white Americans without a college degree that the 2024 cycle would end with some of the wealthiest people in history sitting near Trump as he’s sworn in. But if you’re a member of the elite whose main desire is more riches, you’ve probably gotten your money’s worth — Trump’s new administration could usher in the salad days for the upper 5% of Americans. What’s $100,000 or even $100 million if you can save at least that on your taxes? Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified Rep. Hakeem Jeffries' home state. The error has been corrected above.

By Ryan Deto click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham The site of the Shell ethane cracker plant under construction in Monaca in 2018 Pittsburgh's economic path forward has reached a fork in the road, politically speaking. Two factions are wrestling over the future of the natural-gas and petrochemical industries in the region, and whether to support their growth or to transition away. Currently, a petrochemical cracker plant is being built in Beaver County by oil giant Shell. The plant will refine natural gas, which is fracked from all over Southwestern Pennsylvania, into pellets, which can be used to make plastic products. The development has led other oil and gas companies to strongly consider the nearby Ohio River Valley as a location to host several more cracker plants. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham // Packaging design: Abbie Adams However, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto recently spoke out in opposition to future cracker plants in the region, becoming the most prominent politician in the area to do so. Peduto said the economic vitality of the region will be hurt down the line by the pollution created by an alley of cracker plants, and will make the region unattractive to the tech companies and workers Peduto is trying to recruit. (In September, thousands of workers at Amazon, Google, and Apple protested and called for serious action to address climate change.) This assertion was met swiftly by a rebuttal from another prominent local official, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. He supports the build-out of the petrochemical industry and claimed natural-gas has done wonders for the regional economy. Fitzgerald said the jobs created through these industries are necessary for areas outside of city centers and office parks. According to a recent paper from the Journal of Urban Affairs, Pittsburgh added about 7,000 fracking jobs from 2009-2016, and those numbers have increased slightly since then. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pittsburgh has also been steadily growing its construction employment figures since 2009, including adding about 8,000 jobs since 2016, which was likely helped along by the thousands needed to build the cracker plant in Beaver County. If more cracker plants were to be built, those numbers would continue to go up. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham // Packaging design: Abbie Adams The plastic pellets created at cracker plants Although some politicians say the natural-gas industry can be clean and that we don't have to choose between jobs and the environment, there is a price to pay. The Beaver County cracker plant alone is permitted by the state to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of adding more than 480,000 cars. More cracker plants would mean more emissions; Pittsburgh already has some of the worst air quality in the nation. This also doesn’t factor in the large quantities of methane emissions produced by fracking. Methane is over 25 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than CO2. Peduto is more interested in maintaining the region's growth in tech, research, and white-collar jobs. From 2009-2016, Pittsburgh gained more than 26,000 positions in these combined categories, growing at a rate of more than 21 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, thousands more of these white-collar jobs have continued to be added to Pittsburgh's economy. Other progressives from the region go even further than Peduto and think Pittsburgh should get behind the Green New Deal, a plan that would provide large-scale federal investments to build renewable energy plants and upgrades to the nation’s electricity grid. Green New Deal proponents say it would provide millions of jobs while working to address climate change and air quality. With this split occurring between leaders over whether to continue to support fracking or start to transition away from it, Pittsburgh City Paper sought to determine just where Allegheny County’s elected officials stood on the issue. CP contacted and retrieved statements from 62 elected officials in that represent the county; the ones that have a say on policy related to business and energy, or those with big enough bully pulpits to effect change. Currently, there are 25 elected officials that support pursuing future cracker plants, compared to nine that oppose new plants in the region. For eight of the politicians who provided statements to CP, it was unclear how they felt about fracking and if they supported creating more cracker plants. Twenty state, county, and Pittsburgh city politicians, didn’t provide a statement, or declined to issue one. Five of the nine Pittsburgh City Councilors didn’t offer a statement on cracker plants or fracking, despite the fact that four of them voted to ban fracking within city limits in 2010. Their answers, or non-answers, are listed below and have been edited for length and clarity. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham // Packaging design: Abbie Adams The site of the Shell ethane cracker plant under construction in Monaca in 2018 Federal 3 support, 1 unclear U.S. Sen Bob Casey (D-Scranton) — Supports Didn’t answer questions about future cracker plants, but Casey strongly supported bringing the Shell cracker to Beaver County and also urged other companies, such as Aither Chemicals, to build a cracker plant in the region. He is supportive of fracking and told KDKA in October, “The false choice is that you have to choose fracking over good climate policy.” U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Lehigh) — Supports Issued a statement in October to rebuke Peduto’s comments and calls to ban fracking. \"Natural gas exploration, the cracker plant, and the downstream manufacturing sector are great for Southwestern Pennsylvania,” adding, \"stopping natural gas exploration or banning expansion of the petrochemical industry would ruin the region's economy.” Toomey claims fracking and cracker plants position the region to become a manufacturing hub, but Southwestern Pennsylvania has lost more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs since 2009, even as natural-gas production has grown immensely.U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Forest Hills) — Unclear Has walked a fine line in touting his federal efforts to pass legislation to combat climate change, while never outright condemning the natural-gas industry or cracker plants. For instance, supported cap-and-trade carbon emissions policies, but only with rebates for industries that operate in the region, such as steel. Supports net-zero carbon emissions and a 100% clean economy by 2050, and believes extractive industries like fracking can operate cleanly, if regulated.U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Mt. Lebanon) — Supports Told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in November the natural gas-industry has been, as a whole, beneficial to his district, which encompasses Allegheny County’s northern and western suburbs, as well as all of Beaver County. Said the regional economic future outside Pittsburgh city limits is “energy jobs and manufacturing.” Lamb rejects the notion of a tradeoff between jobs and environmentalism. Supports investing in technology to clean up extractive industries, but not ready to support a carbon tax. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham The site of the Shell ethane cracker plant under construction in Monaca in 2018 State 19 support, 3 opposed, 4 unclear, 4 no word Gov. Tom Wolf (D-York) — Supports In a November KDKA interview, Wolf talked about his support for future cracker plants and the continuation of the natural-gas industry. Wolf said plastic created by the cracker plants could be manufactured into light-weight materials for cars. Claimed the cracker plant in Beaver County would lead to cleaner air and water, despite the fact it is permitted to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. Said banning fracking wouldn’t help the transition to renewable energy, despite the fact that natural-gas and renewables are direct competitors in the energy market. Supports a severance tax on natural-gas drillers to pay for statewide infrastructure improvements. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D-Braddock) — Unclear Fervently supports Wolf’s Restore PA plan to institute a severance tax on fracking companies. Said that plans for a second cracker plant should be discussed in a way that “actually incorporates the real life experience” of cracker plant workers, and says environmental concerns can be addressed with regulation. “Let’s have an honest conversation about a path forward and not declaring an enemy of what the other might be.” During a 2016 run for U.S. Senate, Fetterman supported a moratorium on fracking in Pennsylvania. Said this past support doesn’t conflict with current stance because he called for a moratorium until environmental concerns could be addressed, and now believes they have been. State Sen. Jim Brewster (D-McKeesport) — Support Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. Voted in 2012 for the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Sen. Jay Costa (D-Forest Hills) — Declined comment Costa’s spokesperson declined a request for comment from CP. Voted in 2012 for the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted against HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Sen. Wayne Fontana (D-Brookline) — Unclear Fontana said the decision to create more cracker plants ultimately lies with the counties hosting them, such as Beaver County. If local governments do support cracker plants, then encourages discussions and negotiations focused on requiring the highest environmental standards before offering any public funds. “We do not have to choose between creating good jobs and protecting our environment,” said Fontana. Supports the continued growth of Pittsburgh’s tech and start-up sectors, and said it’s “critical that working people are front and center as we create a new economy.” Voted in 2012 for the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State. Sen. Pam Iovino (D-Mt. Lebanon) — Unclear Iovino spokesperson Josh Fleitman says it’s difficult to provide a yes or no answer on Iovino’s support or opposition to future cracker plants. “When we try and pit jobs against the environment, it is a lose-lose, and if we are going to find a sustainable future, we need to bring labor, nonprofits, elected officials, and environmentalists together,” said Fleitman speaking for Iovino. She believes there is a sustainable middle ground between the fractured groups. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State. Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-West View) — Unclear Doesn’t endorse a ban on fracking, but supports a severance tax on natural-gas drillers. Has said in the past that the region should eventually move away from fossil fuels, but a fracking ban “put countless Pennsylvanians out of work and cause an ecological disaster as well sites, pipelines, and other infrastructure would be abandoned by companies.” Didn’t specifically comment on any potential future cracker plants, but supports stricter inspection and enforcement of natural-gas related industries, and tax credits to encourage investing in renewable energy, as long has local union workers are utilized. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted against HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. House Speaker Mike Turzai (R-Marshall) — Supports Bemoaned Peduto’s comments and said the current cracker plant is supplying thousands of jobs during its construction and is rehabilitating a formerly industrial site. “As a statewide leader, I will ensure that we remain welcoming to these industries and the family-sustaining jobs they provide,” said Turzai in a statement.” While jobs in technology and renewable energy are vital to the current and future prosperity of our region, we should not repeat the mistakes of our past by relying on those industries alone.” Voted in 2012 for the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. House Minority Leader Frank Dermody (D-Oakmont) — Support Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. In 2012, Dermody voted against the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Rep. Bob Brooks (R-Murrysville) — Supports Said he supports “an expanding economy that provides for good paying and family sustaining jobs” and that it’s important to “use of the resources that our communities possesses,” which includes natural-gas reserves. Would rather see natural gas stay within the state than shipping it to other states. “Since Natural Gas is our most abundant natural resource, I encourage the locating of a cracker plant nearby to promote the same additions to local industry.” Brooks also says he supports and promotes good air quality and health improvements for area residents. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Rep. Austin Davis (D-McKeesport) — Supports Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

Tony DeLuca (D-Penn Hills) — Supports Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. DeLuca voted in 2012 for the $1.6 billion state incentive package to support the current Beaver County cracker plant. UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Squirrel Hill) — Opposes Voted against the $1.6 billion state incentive package in 2012 to support the current Beaver County cracker plant because he remembers the legacy needs involved in environmental cleanup of other polluting industries. Said there is an urgent need to regulate polluters already present in the region and needs additional resources to regulate fracking and soon-to-be cracker plant, with possible additional regulations. Said the region is well positioned to move renewable energy forward, with state and local backing. “We should be investing in sustainable and renewable energy solutions, which I believe will be a source of good-paying jobs in the future.” UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted against HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year.

Ed Gainey (D-East Liberty) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.State Rep. Valerie Gaydos (R-Sewickley) — Supports Said future cracker plants “will no doubt result in a substantial economic boom to the region” and believes they can be achieved in an environmentally safe manner and adhere to environmental regulations. Added that plans for renewable energy and upgrades to existing infrastructure shouldn’t be excluded from economic development. Says the local tech industry can play a part in that growth. “In fact, having both or all will work to further propel Pittsburgh and the surrounding regions into being a world-class economy.” UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted for HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year. It is estimated to cost the state upwards of $1 billion. If enacted, the annual tax credits are good until 2050. State Rep. Sara Innamorato (D-Lawrenceville) — Opposes Has been vocal about the environmental and pollution concerns of the natural-gas industry. Opposes the subsidies given out to fracking companies and the cracker plant, and instead supports subsidies for renewable energy, like wind power. Tweeted last year in reference to the diverging economic paths of Pittsburgh’s economy and environmentalism, “As it stands now, we can’t have it both ways.” Tweeted this year that we’re not considering all the ramifications for propping up the natural gas and petrochemical industries. “Families living in the shadow of these industries are forgoing their future wealth with sinking property values while municipalities foot the bill for infrastructure costs exacerbated by climate change.” UPDATE: (Wed., Feb. 5) Voted against HB1100, a bill that would provide tax credits to future petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania, at a cost of $22 million per plant per year.

No region has benefited more. Not just our county, the entire region.” Supported fracking on county-owned land at Deer Lakes Park and the Pittsburgh International Airport. Said the fracking industry has given economic hope for the region after the collapse of steel in the 1980s. Said he’s met with companies often looking to move to Pittsburgh and they never bring up environmental issues related to the cracker plant. Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner (D-Point Breeze) — No response Wagner spokesperson Tracy Royston said the controller isn’t prepared to make a comment at this time. Allegheny County Councilor Tom Baker (R-Ross) — No response Voted in favor of allowing fracking on county owned property in Deer Lakes Park and the Pittsburgh International Airport. Incoming Allegheny County Councilor Liv Bennett (D-North Side) — Opposes Said she opposes the future development of cracker plants in the region. Supports the Green New Deal to “bring clean jobs to our region” that would “provide employment while also ensuring that the residents in our region are able to breathe clean air and drink clean water.” Agrees the cracker plants will be built outside of Allegheny County, but said the pollution produced by these plants will have an impact on the surrounding counties, including Allegheny County.Allegheny County Councilor Patrick Catena (D-Carnegie) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.Allegheny County Councilor Sam DeMarco (R-North Fayette) — Supports Called Peduto’s comments reckless and supports the build-out of the petrochemical industry. “These new facilities are expected to create dozens of spinoff plants in the vicinity, all of them bringing jobs and financial security to the region.” Said the natural-gas industry has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He is calling on other regional leaders and state leaders to denounce Peduto’s comments.

Noted that county council as a body, has supported the buildout of the natural-gas industry with votes to permit fracking at Deer Lakes, PIT airport, and Allegheny County airport. Futules personally supported all these initiatives.Incoming Allegheny County Councilor Bethany Hallam (D-Ross) — Opposes When asked if she supports future cracker plants, Hallam replied “absolutely not.” Said that it’s “important to start preparing our local union workers for jobs in renewable energy.” She is also opposed to fracking. “No one should have to choose between well-paying jobs and a safe, healthy environment.”Allegheny County Councilor Cindy Kirk (R-Wexford) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.Allegheny County Councilor Paul Klein (D-Point Breeze) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.Allegheny County Councilor Bob Macey (D-West Mifflin) — No response Macey has been a vocal supporter of fracking and voted in favor of allowing fracking on county owned property in Deer Lakes Park and the Pittsburgh International AirportAllegheny County Councilor Robert Palmosina (D-Banksville) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.Allegheny County Councilor Anita Prizio (D-O’Hara) — Opposes Is vocally opposed to the future development of the petrochemical industry in the region. Is wary of cracker plants since they create plastic. Said the plastic industry creates a serious waste problem, since only about 10% of plastic waste is being recycled. Would rather see plants converted into thermochemical recycling plants, which could transform plastic factories into recycling refineries, within the framework of their existing infrastructure. Said region should be wary of recreating the petrochemical alley like in Louisiana, which has shown to have high rates of cancer for area residents. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham The site of the Shell ethane cracker plant under construction in Monaca in 2018 City 3 opposed, 3 unclear, 5 no word Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D-Point Breeze) — OpposesAnnounced his opposition to future cracker plants in October and proclaimed, “We don’t have to become the petrochemical/plastics center of the United States.” He told PublicSource that the Pittsburgh region should be investing in environmental clean-up and green energy jobs instead of fracking and related industries. Rejects the belief that environmentalist are anti-business. Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb (D-Mt. Washington) — Unclear Said climate change is real and is confident that carbon dioxide and methane emissions are contributing to global warming and exacerbating air quality. Advocated for a future of renewable energy, but claimed the energy storage sector is not currently advanced enough to permit us to rely solely on renewable energy sources. Wants fracking more appropriately regulated and adequately taxed. Opposes government subsidies to any future cracker plants, since the industries are already attracted to the region. Supports investment in making energy infrastructure more efficient, growing pollution reduction efforts of existing industry and additional research and development of clean energy alternatives.Pittsburgh City Councilor Ricky Burgess (D-Point Breeze) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. Burgess voted to ban fracking within Pittsburgh city limits in 2010. Pittsburgh City Councilor Anthony Coghill (D-Beechview) — Unclear \"My primary focus is on job creation in our region and assuring that those jobs are completed in conjunction with our local labor unions. Job growth must continue to happen in Southwestern PA in order to assure that our region and workers continue to thrive. In Pittsburgh, I feel that we have the ability to include many types of businesses in our growing economy; whether those jobs are in natural gas, green energy, technology, or healthcare — we must assure that Pittsburgh is a region where everyone has opportunity.\"Pittsburgh City Councilor Deb Gross (D-Highland Park) — Opposes Said she is happy to join Lee, Innamorato, Peduto, and Prizio in opposing future cracker plants. Gross questioned just how many jobs related to the cracker plant have been filled by locals, especially city residents. “Let us not trade our wealth and health to prop up a dying industry for someone else’s benefit or the profits for their corporate shareholders.” Said Pittsburgh can create clean energy and light manufacturing jobs, especially when tapping into research at area universities and the skills of the local trade unions. Pittsburgh City Councilor Theresa Kail-Smith (D-West End) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

Pittsburgh City Councilor Erika Strassburger (D-Shadyside) — Opposes Tweeted in November that she opposes the build out of the petrochemical industry: “A clean energy future CAN provide good labor jobs. Don’t tell me it’s not possible.” Rejects the notion that cracker plants are clean and tweeted that emissions associated with the cracker plant in Beaver County alone will negate Pittsburgh's entire climate action plan.Incoming City Councilor Bobby Wilson (D-North Side) — No response Didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

Casa San José’s new community center broke ground in Beechview on Oct. 10 amidst a historic surge of immigration to Pittsburgh. The center will provide services to the residents of the neighborhood, which is home to one of the city's largest Latino populations. \"We really wanted to make sure that we build something that not only fit the staff, but that fits the community. And so I cannot be more excited that this day has finally come,\" said Monica Ruiz, Executive Director of Casa San José, at the center's groundbreaking ceremony. Casa San José, a nonprofit serving Pittsburgh's Latino and immigrant communities since 2013, has long relied on a patchwork of partnerships and rental spaces to offer its services. The multimillion dollar community center will serve as its first permanent home. Roughly 50 people attended the groundbreaking, including community members, local and state representatives, and county officials. The $6.3 million project will expand the vacant property at 1600 Broadway Ave. over the next 16 months. Once completed, residents will be able to access a suite of services, including case management, English classes, youth programs, mental health support, and advocacy. The project's funding comes from American Rescue Plan Act dollars granted by the city, as well as various foundation donations and fundraising campaigns. Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato applauded the project as a \"community asset for everyone.\" \"Celebrating pieces of infrastructure like this are so incredible, and they're so important because this is going to be a space … for everyone in the community,\" Inamorato said. click to enlarge CP Photo: James Paul County executive Sara Innamorato speaks at the Case San José groundbreaking ceremony. According to a 2023 report produced partly by the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh's total population decreased by just over one percent between 2014 and 2019, while the city's immigrant population increased by nearly 20%. In contrast to metro areas like New York, where Mayor Eric Adams has warned that an influx of migrants \"will destroy\" the city, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey has embraced immigration as a needed tonic to the region's graying demographic. Speaking at the groundbreaking, Gainey praised Casa San José for adding value to one of the city's largest population drivers. The 2020 Census clocked Beechview as 10% Hispanic in ethnicity, the highest proportion for any major neighborhood or municipality in the region, according to a report by PublicSource. \"If we don't receive more immigrants into our city, if we're not a city that continues to live up to what our past is, then we will not have a city that is growing,\" Gainey declared at the groundbreaking. \"We will only have a city that's growing old.\" For Hispanic immigrants themselves, Casa San José offers vital assistance in the tumultuous first steps of relocation, be it connecting with banks or navigating the city's bus lines. One such benefactor was Lizebeth Garcia, who immigrated from Mexico to the United States 20 years ago. Garcia, 44, then moved to Pittsburgh in 2013, the same year Janice Vanderneck of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden founded Casa San José. \"When I first got here, I didn't know the city at all; I didn't know what any of the services were,\" Garcia said. \"I had the privilege to actually meet [Vanderneck] that day, and she had an amazing team of a few caseworkers and volunteers at that moment, and the help that I got meant so much to me.\" Ten years later, and now a youth program coordinator for Casa San Jose, Garcia said the expansion would, for the first time, give the organization a brick-and-mortar location to conduct outreach programs at schools across Pittsburgh. The groundbreaking concluded with a ceremonial dirt toss onto the vacant lot where the center will be built out in the coming years. Vanderneck, with white hair and a long career behind her, said it was an outcome she couldn't have predicted when she first started Casa San José. \"Thank you to all those who continue to work so hard,\" Vanderneck said. \"I have friends here from the wider immigrant community, and I appreciate and love you all.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags News Latest in News Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

By Amanda Waltz click to enlarge CP Photo: Stephen Caruso Boat racers at the 2016 EQT Three Rivers Regatta This story was updated Mon., July 15 at 4 p.m. More details have been brought to light regarding the legitimacy of two websites claiming that the Three Rivers Regatta, a popular annual event that has not been presented since 2018, will return this summer. While one website still raises questions, a major figure associated with the Three Rivers Regatta reached out to Pittsburgh City Paper to claim ownership of the other. John R. Bonassi, chairman of the Three Rivers Regatta Board of Directors, the body that has owned the official naming rights of the event since 1978, says they have been working with a company to bring the riverfront festival back. He explains that they tried to stage the Regatta this year but were unable to secure a major sponsor to get it off the ground. The board launched the Regatta website, which features a promotional video by Riverside Productions Inc., a local company hired to manage the event. Bonassi admits that the 2024 date prominently featured on the website was supposed to be changed to 2025 after the board failed to obtain the resources necessary to present the event this year. \"We just could not get a title sponsor, which is critically important,\" he says, adding that, beyond financing, the board \"had many of the moving parts under wraps.\" The event date has since been updated to 2025. To pull the 2025 Regatta off, Bonassi says they would need to bring in a sponsor like EQT, a local private equity that produced previous Regattas, including the last one in 2018. Bonassi says he had no knowledge of the Giuseppe's Pizzeria website until the day the original CP story was published and that the website has no affiliation with the Regatta board. \"I have no idea where this guy is coming from with this website,\" Bonassi says. When asked if the board reached out to Giuseppe's Pizza about taking the website down, Bonassi replied, \"We have not. It has been referred to our attorney.\" Giuseppe's has not returned CP's requests for comment. Bonassi says the Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta \"is the largest inland Regatta in the nation\" and estimates that previous Regattas, which featured entertainment ranging from powerboat races to sand sculptures, usually drew \"300,000 to 500,000 spectators over three days.\" To keep the Regatta free and accessible to the public, as it has been in the past, Bonassi says they would need $550,000-750,000 to cover total costs for the event, including those related to \"entertainment, fireworks, security, police coverage, insurance, park usage fees and 'green' clean up.\" Bonassi, who has served on the Regatta board for 30 years, says he and his fellow board members \"feel confident there will be 2025 Pittsburgh Three Rivers Rivers Regatta,\" adding that they \"plan to retain a firm\" to assist them with \"identifying and securing sponsors.\" \"Signing on quality sponsors has always been a major challenge,\" says Bonassi. \"The availability of corporate and foundation revenues, the economy, politics, and security issues all impact the funding of the Regatta.\" Despite some challenges, Bonassi expresses confidence in Riverside Productions Inc., a company owned by Chahine and Michael Boulos, who Bonassi says has provided food services for \"virtually every festival in Pittsburgh,\" including the Three Rivers Art Festival, Picklesburgh, and, for 40 years, the Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta. As for when they hope to retain a major sponsor, Bonassi says, \"Ideally April 2025 or before.\" See the original story below: The Three Rivers Regatta was once a treasured tradition in Pittsburgh. This was before a shady management company and COVID culminated to put the beloved summer festival, which originally launched in 1978, on hold. Even as other annual festivities, including the Three Rivers Arts Festival and Anthrocon, have returned to Downtown, the Regatta has yet to re-emerge. Those recently Googling the Regatta may have rejoiced at the sight of a new website featuring what looks like an official logo and promises to provide 2024 dates and other details. Delving further would lead users to a page on the website for Giuseppe's Pizzeria, a local pizza chain claiming some involvement with coordinating the next Regatta. The lack of event dates or other information at such a late point in the summer raises questions about the legitimacy of these websites, which also feature sign-ups for vendors, sponsors, and volunteers. Previous Regattas usually took place in August (the last Regatta in 2018 ran from Aug. 3-5), and were backed by major sponsors like EQT. The Giuseppe's webpage claims that the Regatta will be combined with the Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival \"for an unforgettable celebration\" that includes \"thrilling boat races along with world-class jazz performances.\" That detail would seem to shed some light on dates for the 2024 Regatta, given that the Jazz Festival is set to take place from Sept. 19-22 at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center. click to enlarge Screenshot Screenshot of the webpage from Giuseppe's Pizzeria for the Three Rivers Regatta However, Carolyn McClair, the public relations contact for the August Wilson Center, told Pittsburgh City Paper via email that \"our President Janis Burley said there is no collaboration or 'combining for an unforgettable celebration' between the PIJF and the Regatta.\" Adding to the confusion is a \"Contact Information\" section that calls the event \"Giuseppe's Pizzeria Regatta 2024.\" City Paper reached out to Giuseppe's by phone and email and filled out a contact form on the Regatta website asking for more details about the event. Neither has responded. Also unclear is whether or not these websites are soliciting fees from potential vendors applying to appear at what's being promoted as the 2024 Three Rivers Regatta. The questionable websites harken back to shady dealings that led to the last-minute cancellation of the 2019 Regatta. According to a September 2019 CP story, LionHeart Event Group, a former Pittsburgh-based company in charge of organizing the Regatta, failed to acquire insurance and the necessary permits for the event. As a result, the Regatta board and local law enforcement \"quickly launched investigations of potential criminal wrongdoings on the part of LionHeart,\" which filed for bankruptcy with \"between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities.\" click to enlarge CP Photo: Stephen Caruso Boat racers at the 2016 EQT Three Rivers Regatta CP reached out to city and county officials about whether or not permits and other required documents were filed for the 2024 Regatta. Brent Wasko, the public information officer for the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, wrote in an email that \"DPW would only receive a permit request if a county-owned bridge or road was going to be used, and we have not received any permit requests for this. In the past, Point State Park, the North Shore, and the rivers (obviously) were used for this event. So, I assume the City of Pittsburgh, [Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources], and the Coast Guard were involved.\" Abigail Gardner, the director of communications for Allegheny County, also replied that they \"haven’t received any permit requests at the County level.\" The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources manages Point State Park, where the Regatta once took place. While neither website explicitly states that the Regatta will return to Point State Park, some of the promotional imagery depicts boats in and around the waterways Downtown, implying that the location will be used. However, Wesley Robinson, press secretary for the DCNR, tells CP that no permits are being processed to host the Regatta at the park. \"We're not aware of the event at all,\" says Robinson. CP also reached out to the office of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey but has yet to receive a response. This story will be updated as further details come to light.

Other vendors were ready to proceed,” said Three Rivers Regatta board member Charles Scholz at the festival cancellation announcement on Aug. 1. Now, according to WPXI reporter Aaron Martin, LionHeart is filling for bankruptcy. In a tweet with a photo of the company's federal bankruptcy filing, Martin reported that LionHeart between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities.

LionHeart Event Group is now being criminally investigated for its handling of the cancelled event pic.twitter.com/FayIKYASFw— Aaron Martin (@WPXIAaronMartin) September 16, 2019 TribLive reported today that LionHeart had less than $50,000 in assets. WPXI reported in August that LionHeart still owed Allegheny County $32,000 for event security. Following the cancellation in August, the Three Rivers Regatta board and local law enforcement quickly launched investigations of potential criminal wrongdoings on the part of LionHeart. Officials blamed the cancellation on LionHeart's failure to acquire the insurance for the regatta vendors. Sholz told City Paper in August that the Regatta board was considering adopting policies to safeguard against future last-minute cancellations. In addition to failing acquire insurance, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said in August that LionHeart failed to make necessary payments to the Pittsburgh Police in 2019 and 2018. This year was the first time since 1978 that Pittsburgh did not host the Three Rivers Regatta.

By Colin Williams click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost They say a good man is hard to find. But what about a politically ambiguous United States senator? Turns out that may not be so easy, either. I’d know — I’ve spent the past month attempting to reach one of my senators, John Fetterman (D-Pa.). Like many of his constituents, I wanted to know more about why the erstwhile leftwing stalwart has since taken a staunchly pro-Israel stance and even greenlit several of President Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees. I was also hoping to learn more about turnover on his staff, his recent antagonism toward some supporters, and, ideally, the senator’s health, given his previous depression diagnosis and stroke. Lastly, I wanted to know why Fetterman thinks Trump and Elon Musk’s brazen power grab “isn’t a constitutional crisis” when a growing number are calling it a “coup.” In other words, I wanted the same answers from Fetterman that many Fetterman voters want two years into his term. After sending several emails to his staff, calling all six of his offices and leaving voicemails, tagging the senator and several former staffers on social media, texting other former staff members, emailing Braddock-area elected officials, and stopping by his Pittsburgh office, I was finally able to reach the senator’s staff. Unfortunately, days after Pittsburgh City Paper spiked this story to give Fetterman more time to answer questions, Team Fetterman declined to comment, leaving me with the same question as the constituents I interviewed: what does John Fetterman believe? click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson From Braddock to the big time Most locals know that Fetterman used to be mayor of Braddock, where he drew attention to the long-suffering borough’s plight with TV spots, tattoos, and redevelopment projects. At the time, he was given a great deal of credit for rehabilitating the borough. However, he also courted controversy, in one instance pulling a gun on a jogger he mistakenly believed was fleeing a shooting. As national outlets were calling him a “taste god”, Fetterman shot ads for Levi’s and rode Braddock’s glow-up narrative, first to a failed Senate campaign in 2016 (he lost to former state official Katie McGinty, who then lost to Republican incumbent Pat Toomey), and then the Pa. Lieutenant Governorship in 2019. Fetterman used the power of that office to flaunt progressive values, defiantly flying Pride flags and a cannabis leaf banner from his balcony in Harrisburg. Chardaè Jones, who succeeded Fetterman as mayor in 2019, tells Pittsburgh City Paper that, in her view, Fetterman has long seemed more interested in the performative side of politics. “I just feel like he was really good at cosplaying as a working-class individual,” Jones says. “He didn't have the same problems and was afforded more opportunities than your average Braddock person.” Jones notes that the mayoral position’s low pay — $85 per month — was less of an issue for Fetterman given his comparatively well-off family, cutting against the blue-collar narrative. When Toomey announced his return to the private sector in 2020, Fetterman again jumped into the race for Senate. He quickly gained ground on his opponents, including then-Rep. Conor Lamb and Pa. Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (now DNC co-chair), and eventually won the right to face TV personality and Republican nominee Mehmet Oz in the general election. Jones, who says she eventually voted for Fetterman in November, at first endorsed Kenyatta, in part because she says Fetterman had been scarce while Braddock continued to suffer from population loss, decaying infrastructure, and a lack of medical access following UPMC’s withdrawal from the borough. “When he was running for Senate, I lived two doors down from him,” she says. “People were like, ‘Why didn't you endorse Fetterman?’ And I was like, ‘I've been his neighbor for two years and never saw him or spoke to him.’” The 2022 general election was ugly. Fetterman went full bore at Oz, criticizing him as an unqualified carpetbagger and couching his own campaign as centered on “workers, wages and weed.” And then came a stroke that sidelined the candidate for months. When he returned, Fetterman used adaptive technology to overcome new struggles with speech. Online, many have casually implied that this episode changed the senator. In one interview, Fetterman credited the stroke with giving him the “freedom” to “no longer be afraid [of] blowback.” I reached out to Allegheny Health Network to see if they could offer more specifics on the impacts of a stroke, but the network was “uncomfortable” with making doctors available to comment on one patient’s specific case. Fetterman later sought inpatient treatment for depression. After staff “stepped up,” advancing the senator's agenda in his absence, Fetterman returned to his antagonistic ways, prompting a procedural fight over the Senate’s dress code after refusing to change out of his customary hoodie. Jones says her skepticism turned to frustration as Braddock continued to experience issues with gun violence and bad roads. “We have some representation higher up, so maybe in Braddock, we might see something come back to us,” Jones recalls thinking. “But no.” Fetterman would undercut his progressive support further following Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack against Israel and Israel’s subsequent devastation of the Gaza Strip. click to enlarge Photo: Cameron Croston John Fetterman speaks in support of Kamala Harris during a rally on Nov. 4, 2024. Wrapped in the flag One question I especially wanted to ask Fetterman was about his support for Israel. It wasn’t, and still isn’t, clear to me to what extent his support for Zionism is personal, political, both, or neither. Fetterman has been an unwavering, even churlish Israel booster since Hamas’ attack — this has put him at odds with a wide swath of the local electorate in Greater Pittsburgh, particularly progressives, who have steadfastly called for an end to the violence. Just over a month after Oct. 7, Fetterman was recorded booing protestors calling for a ceasefire. Shortly thereafter, he was seen wearing the Israeli flag like a cape at the March for Israel rally. The actions stood in contrast to his earlier criticism of Oz for not recognizing the Armenian Genocide. The senator’s vehement support of Israel’s actions, which many consider a genocide, seems to have been an inflection point for many who voted for him in ’22. Remy Porter, who cast his ballot for Fetterman, says he initially supported the senator in part due to the “positive press coverage” of Fetterman’s tenure as a “reformer” in Braddock, although Porter says he was aware of some negative local stories, too. “I will put myself down as one of those people that, in retrospect, I would call a sucker,” Porter tells City Paper. “I was happy to focus on more of the progressive accomplishments and less on the critique.” Instead of a “loud, full-throated” progressive, Porter says he was quickly “disappointed” by Fetterman’s penchant for trolling and seeming about-face on his past progressive statements, as well as by his stance on Gaza. “That kind of both foreign adventurism and, really, facilitation of what would be ethnic cleansing … is bad.” Porter began sending Fetterman emails. Others accosted the senator in public — in one viral incident that made national headlines, Fetterman was seen mocking a constituent on his way to the elevator, garnering praise from conservatives. His approval rating has since doubled among Republicans. When Trump was reelected, Fetterman distanced himself from fellow Democrats, criticizing his party for being “condescending” to white men. And then came “yea” votes for Trump nominees — including as the sole Democrat to vote “yes” for now-U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi — and conservative immigration policies. Porter says he doesn’t get it. “If [Republicans] don't need your vote, don't give it to them. You're not getting anything out of this,” he says. “Maybe you're gonna get some concession in the future … but out here, your constituents just see that you don't stand for anything.” Fetterman now seems likely to have lost many former supporters like Porter. He’s been called a “craven opportunist” and “jagoff” by progressive publications (in fairness, I should note that he lost CP readers’ vote for Best Jagoff 2024 to UPMC). His office has also seen notable levels of staff turnover, with a former communications director speaking out against Fetterman’s support for Israel and multiple staff members leaving as recently as Feb. 19 for the same reason. It’s unclear if the senator cares. Fetterman, who’s accepted nearly $250,000 in donations from pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, also features prominently on a new hoodie for sale through AIPAC’s website. He dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in January, recently praised Musk, and says “no one is my gatekeeper.” That leaves the rest of us to figure out what has changed — if anything. “I was hoping he'd be the goon version of Bernie Sanders. A quirky, heroic Everyman to represent us,” Fetterman voter Katherine Hayes posted on Bluesky. “I overlooked his banal, opportunistic politicking and focused on his Pride marches.” In another Bluesky post, Hayes stated, “I voted for Fetterman thinking I was supporting a giant, but he's just a troll.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Ryan Deto John Fetterman speaks on a panel of progressives at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Many others have taken to social media to express regret over their votes. “For a brief slip of time Pennsylvania had two Democratic Senators. Starting next month, it appears we’ll have zero,” Bluesky user James Santelli wrote. Porter agrees. “My thesis of his entire voting pattern is: he has no values,” he says. He’s continued to write the senator in hopes of finding answers, although Porter says Fetterman, after a form letter early in his term, has stopped responding. Former Braddock mayor Jones says it’s unclear to her what Fetterman’s endgame was or is. Braddock’s problems remain similar; she says she’s seen little of the senator around the borough in recent years. I ask about her reaction to her predecessor’s rightward drift and what she’s hopeful for as a constituent — Fetterman will, barring the unforeseen, remain in office through Jan. 2029. “I have no idea what his character is at this point or what he stands for,” she says. “I just hope someone runs against him in four years.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, John Fetterman, Chardaè Jones, Rep.

End the occupation now!\" during a protest and funeral march Downtown on Dec. 2, 2023. Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel stunned the world and remains a crisis for hostages still in the Gaza Strip. What followed — a full-scale bombing campaign and ground invasion of Gaza with high civilian casualties — has been no less alarming for many, including some Jewish Pittsburghers and area elected officials. As the war drags on, these locals have been steadfast in calling for a durable peace. \"You can't guarantee the safety of Jews [using] the dispossession of another people,\" Alexandra Weiner, an instructor at the University of Pittsburgh and congregant at Tree of Life, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. She spent two years living in Israel and has friends with both Israeli and Palestinian passports. \"It really pains me to see people attacking the movement for Palestinian lives and justice as antisemitic,\" Weiner says. She and others have called for an immediate end to the conflict and a long-term plan for stability. With hostilities resuming last week after a weeklong truce, those calls are poised to grow more urgent. (Full disclosure: I made my own stance clear in an op-ed last month. Advocating for a ceasefire was one way I was able to connect with several sources in this story.) Weiner sympathizes with the clear stand U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (PA-12) has taken since the war with Hamas began in earnest. Lee has faced a wave of opposition to her calls for peace, with local rabbis and cantors, including Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life, exhorting her to \"exercise better leadership.\" Meanwhile, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has announced plans to spend $100 million to unseat Lee, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and other \"Squad\" members who have questioned Israel's policies. click to enlarge CP photo: Mars Johnson Alexandra Weiner poses for a portrait outside of Thackeray Hall on Dec. 1, 2023. Lee is frustrated by the flood of money but resolute in her position. \"I care about human rights everywhere,\" she tells City Paper. \"Even for so many of our neighbors who aren't there on a ceasefire right now, I think that they are for human rights also. And I think that [we], through pain, through grief, are trying to find our way.\" As Lee has found since her election to the House of Representatives, to speak out is also to invite a certain level of consternation. Particularly within the Jewish community, Palestine can be a thorny subject, testing as it does the deep, complicated relationship between America's Jewish community and Israel. The 2018 synagogue massacre and this year's trial of the perpetrator have added further layers to an already tense local environment. Against the grain Disagreements within Pittsburgh's Jewish community about how to resolve the situation in Gaza have spilled into the open in recent weeks. On Nov. 16, some 152 Jewish Pittsburghers published an open letter (some anonymously) calling for a ceasefire even as others advocate in favor of Hamas' total destruction, regardless of what that means for Gazan civilians. Harry Hochheiser, one of that open letter's signatories, is a biomedical informatics professor at Pitt who's been involved with groups such as Bend the Arc Pittsburgh. He's long felt the tension between Jewish support for Israel and his own misgivings about that country's spasms of violence. Hochheiser is also a congregant at Dor Hadash, which, he emotionally recalls, shared a building with Tree of Life at the time of the 2018 massacre. He says the congregation avoids the topic of Israel during official events because of a \"history of ugliness\" around such discussions. click to enlarge CP photo: Mars Johnson Harry Hochheiser, a biomedical research professor at the University of Pittsburgh, poses for a portrait in the Cathedral of Learning on Dec. 2, 2023. \"Over the past several years, there has been a much more conscious attempt on the part of many national organizations to really sort of link antisemitism and anti-Zionism,\" he says, which has made open discussions harder. \"I think that's completely wrong and, frankly, dangerous to those of us who are here.\" Lee has remained steadfast in her push for an end to the conflict — and for decoupling the conflict from antisemitism and Islamophobia. She's also keen to underscore the ways in which her calls for peace dovetail with Israeli and domestic Jewish dissatisfaction with Binyamin Netanyahu's government, which has grown more pronounced the longer Hamas holds captive the people it abducted on Oct. 7. \"Whether or not we agree on a ceasefire,\" she says, \"we agree on [opposing] the policies of the Netanyahu government.\" Lee says she deplores the \"dehumanization\" of Palestinians and others the Israeli government and its allies have fostered and the ways it imperils community relations. \"The humanity of our neighbors is non-negotiable,\" she says. Lee also says much of the opposition, including AIPAC's eye-popping spending, is mostly a cynical attempt to silence progressive women of color. When the House moved to censure Tlaib, Lee was one of the few Congresspeople to stand with her. \"Rashida is such a loving, compassionate person,\" Lee says of Tlaib. \"I think that a lot of people forget that she is a Palestinian American woman who is living through a trauma and a horror herself.\" The two appeared together with other lawmakers and rabbis affiliated with the activist group Jewish Voices for Peace. Weiner and Hochheiser say the resolve Lee and others have shown has been heartening. \"I'm really thankful that Summer has been consistent in speaking out,\" Weiner tells CP. \"And now there's this letter showing that there is a large community [in support of a ceasefire].\" \"I think most of what Summer's said has been fantastic,\" Hochheiser says. \"She's stumbled a bit, but I give her credit for taking the response that was not going to be an easy one to defend.\" click to enlarge CP photo: Mars Johnson Protestors march down Grant Street during a funeral march for Palestine on Dec. 2, 2023. A Holy Land for all Calls for peace, and gratitude for Lee's stance, haven't just come from Jewish locals. Some Muslim Pittsburghers have been speaking out despite the risks. A few Christian churches have also joined calls for a ceasefire. Amera Khalil, a Syrian Orthodox Christian whose family has deep roots in Pittsburgh, says she is deeply distressed by the war, both because of the heavy civilian toll, and the ways it has exacerbated tensions in a land sacred to all practitioners of Abrahamic religions. \"Remember, this is the Holy Land for all of us,\" Khalil says. She is likewise frustrated by the conflation of opposition to Israel's government with antisemitism. \"We're telling you to stop killing people because people want to have their dignity and their human rights. That's not being an antisemite; that's being a good person.\" Pastor Chad Collins of Valley View Presbyterian Church in Garfield agrees. He notes that the demonym \"Palestinian\" includes Christians, Muslims, Jews, Druze and others. \"The resistance is Palestinian, period, and their desire for freedom, equal rights, liberation is across the board\" without regard to faith, he says. Collins has been active both within his church and in the broader community, working nationally with Friends of Sabeel North America (FOSNA), a Christian organization focused on creating peace in the Levant. He says the current bloodshed threatens to exceed the 1948 Nakba (\"catastrophe\" in Arabic, a term widely used to describe displacement of Palestinians of all faiths during the creation of Israel). \"About 15,000 people were killed in [1948]. And about not quite a million people were forced into refugee life. But today, after almost two months, this war has killed almost 20,000 or more, and there are some [Palestinians] that are missing still,\" he says. (The true death toll is debated, with some pro-Israeli factions disputing the Hamas-run Ministry of Health's tally, while at least one Israeli security source has corroborated the figure of 20,000.) Lee is likewise concerned about the swift mounting of casualties. Despite the complicated situation, \"protecting civilian life is not complex,\" she says. Some of the loudest local calls for peace have come from student groups. Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and similar groups at Carnegie Mellon University have staged several protests and walkouts since the war in Gaza began. The group protested last weekend and is organizing further demonstrations. Though SJP didn't immediately respond to CP's requests for comment, student leaders indicated they were organizing ahead of protests in and around Pittsburgh and a demonstration in Harrisburg on Dec. 10. Political pressure Collins says he hopes Democratic politicians, in particular, heed calls for a ceasefire. He says he finds cause for optimism in current protests and urges officials to treat them seriously. \"You can't take our vote for granted anymore on this issue,\" he warns. Some Democrats are already getting blowback from their constituents. Weiner calls Sen. John Fetterman's appearance at a pro-Israel rally that featured controversial pastor John Hagee \"a huge disappointment.\" Hochheiser likewise deplores the way Democratic politicians such as Fetterman have become strange bedfellows with religious extremists. \"I'd like to be able to say, look, you know, we can criticize Israel as Jews from a Jewish perspective without making alliances with religious right folks who would … throw us under the bus,\" he says. Whatever their positions vis-à-vis Israel, the war has taken a heavy psychological toll on many Pittsburghers. Khalil says she has struggled with poor mental health since Oct. 7. \"My heart is broken,\" she says, noting that this tragedy comes on the heels of years of horror in her family's ancestral home of Syria. However, she believes peace is possible within her lifetime. She says it's her \"dream\" to \"be able to go to the Holy Land freely, without feeling any kind of racism or being oppressed because I'm an Arab and I'm a Christian.\" Here in Allegheny County, local officials say they're sensitive to the war's implications for Jewish Pittsburghers, Muslim and Arab Pittsburghers, and others. County executive-elect Sara Innamorato is keenly aware of the ongoing threat antisemitism poses to the community and underscores the work she and her transition team are doing to make the county as inclusive as possible. \"I'm checking in with folks in the Muslim community to ensure that they have what they need to feel safe, healthy, secure, connected, and I'm checking in with the Jewish community to make sure that they have what they need to do the same,\" Innamorato tells CP. \"Allegheny County is a place for all of us.\" click to enlarge CP photo: Mars Johnson Protestors march down Grant Street during a funeral march for Palestine on Dec. 2, 2023. Lee says she's working to do likewise, especially as antisemitic vandalism adds to locals' fears for their safety. \"Our Jewish community is one community that has been harmed consistently,\" she says, \"and they need to know that we are not here to bring more harm onto them.\" To that end, Lee and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey recently co-introduced legislation that would bar those convicted of hate crimes from obtaining firearms. Eva Resnick-Day, another signatory of the Ceasefire Now open letter, told CP in an emailed statement: \"My Jewish upbringing taught me that 'never again' should [include] any people be[ing] dehumanized and targeted for who they are.\" Day-Resnick said she was \"proud that my Congresswoman Summer Lee has the moral character and clarity to speak up against the dehumanization and horrific mass murders of Palestinians and Israelis, and to condemn the dangerous and rampant Islamophobia and Antisemitism with rigor.\" Lee says key to all of this is members of the \"beloved community\" listening to one another as all parties seek an end to the conflict. \"We want to keep Israelis and innocent Palestinians and innocent people, wherever they are, safe,\" Lee says. \"We want to bring hostages home. We want them home safely. And we know, and I, personally, just believe, that a ceasefire is the best way to do that. Working towards a just and lasting peace is how we do that.\" Slideshow Chanukah for Cease Fire Click to View 16 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Community Action, Alexandra Weiner, University of Pittsburgh, Tree of Life, U.S. Rep.

The potential amendment to Pittsburgh’s Home Rule Charter would apply to any government actively perpetuating genocide, though Israel is specifically named in the text. Not on Our Dime tells Pittsburgh City Paper that hundreds of volunteers gathered a total of 21,411 signatures (slightly higher than its initial count) over a seven-week period, well above the required threshold of 12,459 signatures. If the campaign’s submission qualifies, the referendum will appear on the May 20 primary election ballot. A prior iteration of the group, No War Crimes on Our Dime, proposed a similar ballot referendum last August that specifically targeted divestment from the State of Israel. The group ultimately withdrew its petition containing 15,253 signatures amidst legal challenges brought by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh — which retained lawyers representing Donald Trump in his attempts to overturn the 2020 election — and by City Controller Rachael Heisler. Maria Montaño, who served as Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey's director of communications of more than two years, also resigned after it came to light that she had signed the petition. The resignation, legal challenges, and ensuing controversies left some supporters demoralized. Ben Case, a Not on Our Dime founder and steering committee member, tells City Paper that, while the group is again preparing for legal challenges, his campaign experience this time has been “extremely positive and inspiring” with broad support from Pittsburghers. “We know from day one, a majority of people in America wanted a ceasefire,” Case says. “We know a majority of voters want an arms embargo on Israel to stop the genocide, but we have so few politicians who are willing to say something about that.” click to enlarge Mars Johnson Hundreds of people participated in the \"Hands off Rafah\" protest organized by Students for Justice in Palestine from the University of Pittsburgh outside of Target in East Liberty on Feb. 16, 2024. Case says the campaign’s new target of 20,000 to 25,000 signatures initially struck him as ambitious and “the fact that we have gotten into that range is just absolutely incredible, and a testament to how many people have leaned in.” He believes the campaign’s reach underscores popular opposition of U.S. aid to Israel, where violence continues in the Gaza Strip despite a temporary ceasefire agreement. “Obviously, the goal is for [this] to make it on the ballot and win,” Case tells CP. “But the point here is that a majority of people want a change in policy when it comes to unconditional U.S. funding for the Israeli military. And that’s something that’s not going away. Politicians need to take this seriously.” Since its efforts last August, Not on Our Dime, which is based in Pittsburgh, has been “learning as we went,” Case says. The group has refined its proposal while combatting what Case describes as misinformation. In addition to redrafting its 70-word ballot question, Not on Our Dime wrote text for the referendum amendment and worked with lawyers to ensure it would be “implementable” if passed. Similar to objections that arose during the last campaign, advocacy groups and city officials including Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey have expressed concern at the referendum’s potential impact on city governance. In a WESA report, Gainey said he was wary it might impair “City government’s ability to conduct basic functions.” Case encourages anyone concerned to view the full text of the referendum amendment (in addition to a Not on Our Dime Frequently Asked Questions document), noting that increasing transparency is one of the campaign’s goals. He also tells CP parts of the amendment are not without precedent. In 2020, the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund adopted a “sweeping” Social Responsible Investment policy. When it comes to procurement processes, the amendment would apply only to entities directly contracted with the city. Not on Our Dime asserts that financialization could pose the largest challenge to implementation, writing, “there are now large intermediaries that exist to smooth out corporate contracts with governments, which often resell the services of other corporations.” For example, Pittsburgh-based weapons manufacturer Howmet, which sells aircraft parts to Israel, might not have a city contract, Case tells CP, but the goal of the new amendment would be to bring “more scrutiny on companies like that exist in Pittsburgh.” “Let's have that discussion in the public sphere,” Case says. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Palestine supporters gather outside of Howmet Aerospace on the North Side to protest the company's involvement in providing parts for F-35 jets on Dec. 2, 2024. To address concerns such as Mayor Gainey's that the amendment would curtail or shut down essential services, the new text also includes language specifying that policy be implemented “to the greatest extent possible.” “This is a hypothetical, but if there's only one company that supplies a part for ambulances or life-saving services ... that does business with the State of Israel, and the city decided it's not possible to divest from this, that would be permissible under this [new amendment],” Case explains, advocating again for public discussion. He also contends that Not on Our Dime volunteers are Pittsburgh residents who have a vested interest in the city continuing to operate. \"We don't want our services to stop,” Case says. “We want our city to be better. And one of the ways we want to make it better is to say, we don't want our money going to support bombs being dropped on children in refugee camps. We think that's important.” Though Pittsburgh’s initiative, if successful, would be the first in the U.S. to pass by popular vote, Case points to other cities that have adopted divestment measures through their city councils including Dearborn, Mich., Portland, Maine, and Richmond, Calif. “Those cities have not collapsed,” he says. Facing accusations of antisemitism, Case, who is Jewish, tells CP the amendment's current emphasis on Israel is because the country is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid and is committing a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Not on Our Dime volunteers, some of whom are Jewish, differ greatly in their views about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Case says, but not about divestment and an end to genocide. The proposed amendment's language was expanded to be applicable to any country or government in part to represent “universal moral principles,” Case says. “It’s time we bring Pittsburgh’s finances in line with our values,” the Not on Our Dime website reads. In a larger sense, Case views Not on Our Dime's petition for a ballot referendum as a victory for direct democracy, particularly in a chilling environment under the second Trump administration. The United States has no national referendum process, and neither do half of states including Pennsylvania, leaving only city charters as a recourse. “The challenges of trying to kick [the referendum] off the ballot are just anti-democracy,” Case tells CP. “That's not good for us in the long run, especially looking at where the federal government's going. I'd want people to just stop and think for a moment about the implications of closing off avenues of democracy right now.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Not on Our Dime, Ben Case, No War Crimes on Our Dime, Ed Gainey, Rachael Heisler, Maria Montaño, Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh Related Content ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Mayoral candidates point fingers on developer donations and affordable housing By Colin Williams Mar 10, 2025 Gainey calls out MAGA donations and O'Connor claps back as mayoral race heats up By Matt Petras Mar 3, 2025 Gainey, O'Connor clash on housing and Pittsburgh's budget in weekend debate By Laura Trybus Feb 3, 2025 Latest in Social Justice Feyisola Akintola is on a mission to make Pittsburgh more welcoming By Aakanksha Agarwal Feb 24, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 As ICE detains locals, dozens of businesses join A Day Without Immigrants By Colin Williams Feb 3, 2025 Ahead of a pending ceasefire, an Israeli and a Palestinian activist see a future together By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 16, 2025 More » More Social Justice All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

An IDF soldier was speaking near Pitt's campus. Organizers leading a campaign that sought to put the question of the city’s divestment from the State of Israel on the November ballot today announced that they have withdrawn their effort, citing the overwhelming legal resources of their challengers. The announcement of the initiative last week was swiftly followed by revelations that local political figures, including City of Pittsburgh communications director Maria Montaño, had signed petitions to get the measure on the ballot. Montaño subsequently resigned. “We don’t have the same resources as the challengers to fight for this in court, so, unfortunately, at this time, their voter suppression was successful,” said organizer Ben Case of the No War Crimes on Our Dime campaign at a press conference on Monday. “In short, thousands of Pittsburghers wanted this referendum to appear on the ballot … [our challengers] were so adamant about pushing this off the ballot because they knew if it went to a vote, it would win.” The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh; clergy from four local congregations including Beth Shalom, Temple Sinai, and Shaare Torah; and City Controller Rachael Heisler had filed legal objections to the majority of the over 15,000 signatures the campaign had collected and to the content of the referendum itself (full disclosure: the author is a signatory). Controller Heisler disputed organizers’ characterization of the legal proceedings, saying in a written statement, “The petitioners were not ‘pushed off’ of anything – they simply failed to collect enough valid signatures to get on the ballot. Our office, and the other objectors, followed the legal process available to us.” In a press release Monday, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh called this development “a decisive win for our Jewish community, local voters, and the entire City of Pittsburgh,” continuing, “From the start, we recognized the danger this referendum represented, and we are grateful to our dedicated team of attorneys — Ron Hicks, Carolyn McGee, and Efrem Grail, who worked without charge to bring home this important legal win. We also extend our deepest gratitude to the Beacon Coalition, the 150 volunteers who devoted countless hours reviewing the petition and City Controller Rachel Heisler for also challenging the petition. Their combined efforts led us to this victory against the first attempt to qualify an anti-Israel boycott and divestment proposal at the municipal level to a popular vote.” Referendum organizers described their ballot initiative as a continuation of grassroots efforts to push local elected officials to take action to end U.S. military aid to Israel amid Israel’s assault on Gaza that has so far killed at least 40,000 Palestinians. “Our effort to get a question on divestment on the ballot began as a response to our politicians who refused to listen to the majority as we have been asking, begging, pleading to see action beyond lip service to support a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. And, as we are directed to do, we employed the democratic levers at our disposal,” said organizer Addy Lord. Elyanna Sharbaji, a Syrian refugee who described herself as a survivor of genocide, said that her participation in the referendum campaign has left her hopeful that a better world is possible and called out local elected officials like Heisler, who she says have failed to listen to their constituents’ calls for action to support a ceasefire. “Many of us here today have taken action, calling our representatives asking them to support a ceasefire and urging them to stop the funding of a genocide that’s happening in Gaza. We’ve also introduced a ceasefire resolution at the county level, and we’ve seen incredible support from the community, with hundreds showing up in person to back the resolution. But despite all of this, our government officials, those who are supposed to represent us, have chosen to ignore the will of their constituents,” Sharbaji said. “Students in our local universities have demanded their academic institutions divest from funding the genocide. Yet, these students were met with violence and police brutality.” Alexandra Weiner, a local educator and outspoken Jewish advocate for Palestinian liberation, described her grief that much of the Pittsburgh Jewish community continues to support Israel’s apparent disregard for the lives of Palestinians. “[The Jewish Federation and others] announced this challenge on Tisha B’Av, the Jewish day of grief and mourning. I cannot help but feel grief that Jewish Pittsburghers that I’ve known in my community for years — Jeffrey Finkelstein, Seth Adelson, Efrem Grail, Audrey Glickman, and more — have decided to engage in such antidemocratic behavior to defend sending money to Israel. I feel grief that the family and friends that I lost on October 27, 2018 [in the Tree of Life massacre] are being used to justify this behavior,” Weiner said. “Most tragically, I feel grief seeing the pictures and videos every single day of what the Israeli military is doing in Gaza. Schools being bombed with hundreds of civilians sheltering inside, fathers mourning their newborns with their birth certificates in hand and children dying of polio and starvation, all of this on the dime of the U.S. taxpayer and with the full support of Sens. Fetterman and Casey, Gov. Shapiro, Pres. Biden, and Vice President Harris.” Referendum advocates and their legal challengers disagree about whether the majority of Pittsburgh voters support divestment from Israel. “I believe the referendum language itself is why they failed to get enough signatures,” wrote Heisler in her statement. “City residents do not want to lose access to the essential drugs our medics and EMTs carry, or the safety equipment that protects our firefighters, or the electricity that keeps the lights on. This is fundamentally bad policy that would not make anyone safer — in Pittsburgh or in Gaza.” Sharbaji contended otherwise, citing polling commissioned by the campaign that shows a majority of local voters would support the referendum. “We know without a doubt that if this question had made it to the ballot, we would have won, that people support a ceasefire, they demand an end to the funding of genocide, and they stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza,” Sharbaji said. Case and other campaign organizers said they do not plan to give up their efforts. “We are proud to be part of a growing movement across the country that says we will not sit idly by while our government sends our tax dollars to fund war crimes and apartheid,” Case said. “We may have been pushed off the ballot today, but we’re not going anywhere. We’ll be back, we’ll be stronger, and we’ll use every avenue available to us to fight for peace, equality, and justice from Pittsburgh to Palestine.” Editor's note: An earlier headline on this story identified the legal challenges to this referendum as \"well-funded.\" That language was incorrect and has been removed. We regret the inaccuracy.

Protesters marched down Penn Ave. demanding justice and calling for a ceasefire in Rafah, a city in Gaza. Amid significant legal challenges to a proposed referendum that would ban the City of Pittsburgh from doing business with entities with financial ties to Israel, advocates say they're encouraged by new polling that shows a significant majority of Pittsburgh voters support the proposal. “We’re putting divestment from the state of Israel conditional on a ceasefire, humanitarian aid being able to reach all Gazans in need, and equal rights being granted to everyone living in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories on the ballot,” says Ben Case, an organizer with the No War Crimes on Our Dime campaign. On Aug. 6, the group, which is fiscally sponsored by the Pittsburgh Democratic Socialists of America, filed a petition bearing more than 15,000 signatures with the county elections division in hopes of making the ballot for the upcoming general election in November. The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh and the City Controller’s office filed legal challenges in the Court of Common Pleas on Tuesday, asking a judge to throw out the petition. “The proposed referendum is not only illegal but also a dangerous and insidious attempt to target local entities connected to the State of Israel,” said Jeff Finkelstein, President & CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. “This measure will do nothing to impact policy in the Middle East, but it will impose an unreasonable burden on our city and its Jewish institutions, synagogues, and other houses of worship.” In their court filing, the Jewish Federation is challenging the validity of more than 10,000 of the 15,253 signatures on the petition, which requires 12,459 signatures to be successful (full disclosure: the author is a signatory). Senior rabbis from four congregations including Temple Sinai, Congregation Beth Shalom, and Shaare Torah Congregation join the Federation in their suit. Two of the lawyers hired by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh previously represented Donald Trump in his attempt to overturn Pennsylvania’s 2020 presidential election results. Ron Hicks and Carolyn McGee initially represented former president Trump in his federal suit seeking to invalidate the results of the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania but withdrew from the lawsuit after public backlash. The Philadelphia Inquirer described the pair as “some of the most in-demand GOP elections lawyers in the state.” In a written statement, the No War Crimes on Our Dime campaign characterized the challenge to the signature count as “voter suppression,” drawing parallels between the effort to block the referendum and Trump’s unsuccessful attempt to throw out Pennsylvania’s election results. “It is disheartening and concerning to see the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh attempting blatant voter suppression rather than let Pittsburghers vote in November on how we want our tax dollars spent,” said Matt Rubin, field director for No War Crimes on our Dime. “The challenge they’ve brought is carried out by a legal team best known for attempting to invalidate hundreds of thousands of voters on behalf of former President Trump’s campaign following his loss in the 2020 election, and it seems they’re once again working to overturn the will of thousands of voters.” Hicks did not respond to a request for comment. click to enlarge CP photo: Mars Johnson Pro-Israel supporters protest the pro-Palestine \"die-in\" protest that took place at the Cathedral of Learning on March 29, 2024. The Jewish Federation is not alone in their efforts to block the referendum. City Controller Rachael Heisler also filed a legal challenge to the petition, arguing, among other things, that the proposed referendum may negatively impact the city’s day-to-day operations and long-term fiscal health. “As City Controller, I have a responsibility to City residents to protect their tax dollars and ensure the City can continue to provide essential services — especially keeping people safe and healthy,” said Heisler in a press release. “If this initiative becomes law, it would severely affect our ability to do both. It could prevent us from carrying out basic City functions, like providing electricity, purchasing life-saving medications, buying protective equipment for first responders, and even fueling police vehicles — to name a few. It would severely disrupt the City’s entire contracting process, causing tremendous inefficiency and creating a massive risk of financial waste.” In response to Heisler’s arguments that the referendum would be too difficult to implement, Case says that while “the specifics of implementation are always going to be a question with popular referendums, especially when you have a 75-word limit,” referendum advocates are confident that, should the initiative pass, the city government will be able to implement it “in a way that is reasonable and responsible,” while upholding the spirit of the referendum, “which is that Pittsburghers do not want our public resources going to support the Israeli war machine that is committing massacres in Gaza and enforcing an apartheid regime over Palestinians.” Both challenges argue that the proposed referendum would violate Pennsylvania's 2016 anti-Boycott, Divest, and Sanction legislation that bars the commonwealth from contracting with companies that boycott Israel and similar federal legislation that disallows governmental bodies from boycotting Israel. Case says that, unfortunately, there is no mechanism in Pennsylvania or on the federal level for voters to register their objections to U.S. military support for Israel’s violence against Palestinians. “The United States single-handedly enables Israel to commit war crimes and maintain its illegal occupation. No one gives us a democratic say on these policies nationally because both parties’ leadership support it, so we have nowhere to turn. And the U.S. doesn’t have a national ballot initiative and referendum system. Pennsylvania doesn’t have citizen initiated ballot measures either,” Case tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “But our city of Pittsburgh does. So we’re using that democratic mechanism to send a very clear message that we’re through letting our public resources enable Israeli war crimes, and we hope others will follow suit.” The case will be heard on Monday before Judge John T. McVay Jr. Despite these legal objections, the activists advancing the proposed referendum say most Pittsburghers approve of this attempt to apply economic pressure to Israel. New polling commissioned by the No War Crimes on Our Dime campaign indicates that a substantial majority of Pittsburgh voters approve of the referendum as currently worded. click to enlarge Graphic courtesy of No War Crimes on Our Dime A poll conducted pro bono by a leading firm found broad support for Pittsburgh's divestment from Israeli companies. The poll, conducted last month, found that 63% of Pittsburgh voters support the referendum, including 70% of registered Democrats and 75% of people between the ages of 18 and 35. “Voters in Pittsburgh across the board want to see this referendum on the ballot and they want to pass this referendum. They want to vote yes for this,” said Case. Although a majority of every demographic breakdown according to race, age, and gender supported the referendum, Black voters were the most likely racial group to support it, at 70%, and women were more likely than men to approve of the proposed referendum, which was presented in full to respondents. The polling firm offered its services to the campaign pro bono on the condition of anonymity, but City Paper has verified that the polling was done by an industry-leading firm. An individual who worked on the poll told CP that the poll drew from a pool of high-quality survey responses that is larger than that of the average poll and has a margin of error that is low by industry standards. The firm also confirmed that all responses considered belonged to a registered voter and weighted results to likely voters in Pittsburgh based on demographic data and party affiliation. “Americans are tired of the bloodshed and injustice that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and voters are done funding the Israeli military’s war crimes and illegal occupation,” reads the campaign’s one-pager on the polling results. “It is time to change course. Pittsburgh voters are ready to take concrete action toward peace.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Israel, No War Crimes on Our Dime, Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Democratic Socialists of America, Ben Case, Matt Rubin, Jeff Finkelstein, Rachael Heisler Related Content After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 Advocates end their campaign for divestment from Israel after legal challenges By Jordana Rosenfeld Aug 19, 2024 With tragedy averted, distrust lingers after second Gaza encampment disbands By Colin Williams Jun 6, 2024 Latest in Social Justice After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Feyisola Akintola is on a mission to make Pittsburgh more welcoming By Aakanksha Agarwal Feb 24, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 As ICE detains locals, dozens of businesses join A Day Without Immigrants By Colin Williams Feb 3, 2025 More » More Social Justice All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

It has become a civic buzzword, an easy stand-in for progress, a term invoked in press releases and mayoral briefings. But for her, it has never been about optics, slogans, or carefully curated diversity statements. “A truly welcoming city goes beyond superficial sentiments,” she says. “It actively removes barriers and creates meaningful opportunities for all residents to succeed.” That philosophy has shaped her work in Pittsburgh, where she has spent years helping immigrants navigate the fine print of government systems, advocating for policy shifts, and working alongside city leaders and community organizations to push for a city that works for everyone, not just the people already in power. Akintola’s expertise is backed by a deep academic foundation. She is currently pursuing a doctor of education in education policy and social change at the University of Pittsburgh, where she focuses on policy implementation and evaluation, with the goal of ensuring that immigrant inclusion efforts are both sustainable and effective. But she is under no illusions about how much work remains. “A truly welcoming city doesn’t just say, ‘We like diversity,’” she says. “It actively removes barriers and creates meaningful opportunities for all residents to succeed.” And Pittsburgh? For all its progress, it still has plenty of barriers. Starting over Akintola knows what it means to start over. In 1999, when she was ten years old, she left Nigeria for Stone Mountain, Ga., a move she did not choose and a shift that forced her to rethink everything she understood about belonging. “In Nigeria, community is everything; it’s a means of survival, actually,” she says. “Your neighbors are like family. If you get in trouble, they discipline you. If you need food, someone feeds you. You grow up knowing that your life is woven into the people around you.” That changed the moment she landed in Atlanta. “Moving from Nigeria to the U.S. required me to adapt to a completely new culture, different social norms, communication styles, and expectations,” she explains. “Here, it’s different. It’s individualistic. It’s ‘stay in your lane.’ You go from knowing everyone on your street to barely talking to the person next door.” That shift — being thrust into a culture that prioritized independence over interdependence — stayed with her. Years later, when she found herself in leadership roles in Pittsburgh, she knew exactly what she wanted to do: create spaces where people felt like they belonged. Two decades later, Akintola is no longer the new girl in town. She has made a name for herself as a civic leader, a strategist, and—if you ask around—a quiet disruptor. Her leadership journey includes time in the Emerging Leaders Collaborative at the Pittsburgh Leadership Foundation (2020), where she honed her ability to build trust and influence positive change. She was also a Coro Pittsburgh Women in Leadership Fellow (2016-2017), part of a prestigious program aimed at advancing the status of women in leadership roles across southwestern Pennsylvania. “Belonging matters,” she says. “People need to know they’re not just tolerated; they’re an integral part of the fabric of the city.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Rewriting the rules If you want to understand how well a city serves its people, ask someone who has tried to navigate its systems. That’s how Akintola ended up working in city government: not because she dreamed of becoming a bureaucrat, but because she saw too many people getting lost in policies that were supposedly designed to help them. Take something as basic as setting up utilities. “Take this as an example. You move here as a refugee, and you need water, electricity, basic things, right?” she says. “But the system is designed for people who have credit history, references, bank accounts. If you don’t have those, good luck.” So she and her colleagues brought together key stakeholders, fostering conversations that led to actionable solutions. “We were able to work with URA, [Pittsburgh Water], and other partners to streamline processes, communicate better with immigrant and refugee communities, and make sure unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles weren’t getting in the way,” she explains. Not every effort like this was neatly packaged into a formal program, but that wasn’t the point. “They reflected our collective commitment to removing red tape and fostering collective understanding,” she says. From 2018 to 2023, Akintola led Welcoming Pittsburgh, the Mayor’s Office initiative focused on immigrant inclusion, working with city departments, resettlement agencies, and local organizations to remove structural barriers. During her tenure, she also managed the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (2022-2023), where she led legislative advocacy, workforce development initiatives, and language access strategies. Eventually, Pittsburgh became a Certified Welcoming city in 2021, the 12th in the country and the third in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (after Erie and Lancaster) to receive that designation. But Akintola is pragmatic about what that actually means. “This recognition provided a structured framework for measuring, promoting, guiding, and validating welcoming efforts,” she explains. “But the real impact lies not in staying stagnant but in continuously challenging ourselves and exploring ways to improve.” Akintola doesn’t just see this work in policy terms; she sees it in personal ones. She grew up watching her parents build and rebuild their lives, doing whatever was necessary to create stability. “My father was an entrepreneur, and my mother tried everything — Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, working at Publix, becoming a CNA — whatever it took to provide for our family,” she recalls. Her foundation in both economics and business and sustainability has helped her understand how policy impacts economic mobility, particularly for immigrant and refugee families. “That’s the story of so many immigrants: they never stop trying, especially if there’s even a glimmer of hope that things will be better for the next generation,” she says. But she also knows that sheer hustle isn’t enough. “We need to make sure people have access to the resources, the networks, the connections they need to give their hopes a fighting chance.” Sometimes, the impact is bigger than any one program — it’s about changing how people see their own government. “When communities see their concerns being heard and addressed, there’s a shift,” she says. “They begin to see government as something that belongs to them, not just something that operates above them.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson What would an ideal Pittsburgh look like? If Akintola could build anything for Pittsburgh’s immigrant communities, free of budget and logistical constraints, she knows exactly what it would be: a Welcome Center. “A safe space for accessing services — legal aid, job training, housing assistance, learning English,” she says. “A community hub where new people to the city can connect and make friends.” One of her favorite ideas is a rotating cultural café, where different immigrant groups take turns running the space each month — one month led by Afghan women, another by Congolese entrepreneurs. “This would invite Pittsburghers to engage directly with immigrant communities, fostering cross-cultural understanding,” she says. And then there’s the “Quick Chat With…” series, where city leaders, business executives, and even celebrities — think the mayor, a Steelers player, the CEO of Duolingo — sit down for informal conversations with the immigrant community. Also, it would be accessible from different parts of the city. “Too often, resources are concentrated in one area,” she says. “This would be a space designed by immigrants, but welcoming to all.” For all her big-picture thinking, Akintola is also deeply attuned to the micro-moments that shape a life. These days, that means being present for her two young kids. “I don’t think I ‘balance’ motherhood and leadership in the traditional sense,” she says. “Instead, I pray for wisdom and direction on how to be a good steward of the children God has blessed me with.” She takes them to cultural events, exposes them to different traditions, and ensures they stay connected to their Nigerian roots. “I make sure they eat the food, dance to the music, learn the language. Because I want them to understand that their identity is a gift, not a burden.” Even though she’s not in City Hall right now, she has big hopes for how Pittsburgh will look like in ten years from now. “I see a future where resettlement agencies are financially supported by local government, ensuring sustainability beyond federal and foundation grants,” she says. “Vacant lots and abandoned buildings are made more accessible for established communities, immigrant and refugee communities to develop and steward.” She also envisions a city where Downtown and regional development and economic investments are shaped by diverse voices, not just those already in power. If she could give her younger self — or any immigrant trying to establish themselves in Pittsburgh,one piece of advice — it would be this: “Don’t give up,” she says. “Transitioning to a new place is hard,physically, emotionally,but know that there are people ready to help, guide, and encourage you. Pittsburgh needs your voice, your talents, and your contributions.” Her biggest piece of advice? Step outside of your comfort zone. “Don’t be afraid to ask for help,” she says. “And make an effort to build friendships beyond your own community. It’s natural to gravitate toward those who speak your language and share your background, but true belonging comes from connecting with others and embracing new experiences.” “Above everything, always remember you belong here.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Feyisola Akintola Related Content Pittsburgh immigrant communities inform World Square dance, music, food, and more By Amanda Waltz May 29, 2023 Latest in Social Justice After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 As ICE detains locals, dozens of businesses join A Day Without Immigrants By Colin Williams Feb 3, 2025 Ahead of a pending ceasefire, an Israeli and a Palestinian activist see a future together By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 16, 2025 More » More Social Justice All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

Pittsburgh’s immigrant community is scared — but it has the support of dozens of local business and city leadership, whose representatives gathered Feb. 3 to observe A Day Without Immigrants. At least 60 businesses closed Monday in solidarity, and local leaders encouraged people not to spend money as part of a national day of action. “Even though these people are going to lose money today because they're not open, that's nothing compared to what can happen for the years to come if things continue to be the way that they're going right now,” Casa San José Executive Director Monica Ruiz told assembled media. Ruiz was referring in large part to raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been making targeted raids across the country following Donald Trump’s inauguration as President. Ruiz said ICE raids in Pittsburgh led to detaining some citizens and legal residents. She said the entire Latino community in Pittsburgh and surrounding counties is scared, with many workers staying home from their jobs. “Just today, two people were picked up with [legal immigration] status. So people are afraid to be walking around going to work because of the color of their skin.” For that reason, businesses participating in A Day without Immigrants were doing so without fanfare. “ICE is very, very active,” Ruiz said. “This morning alone, I know of three targeted areas.” She said Casa San José had heard reports of raids in Butler and Washington counties, as well. Part of A Day Without Immigrants, Ruiz and others said, was to call attention to the economic impact of immigration. Guillermo Velazquez, executive director of the Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation (PHDC), said absent employees and depleted workforces would have major ripple effects. “Very proudly, we can say that a lot of Latinos have created new companies, created jobs, [bought] houses, and all of that is really what we want in this region … since 2017, we have incorporated already 185 new companies,” Velazquez told press. “Immigrants basically contribute about $2 billion in revenue to the state. So it's something that, in terms of economics, we are worried about.” The speakers all emphasized Pittsburgh’s historic status as a haven for immigrants, many of whom arrived before the Immigration Act of 1924. Pittsburgh Deputy Mayor Jake Pawlak noted that new waves of immigrants, including his ancestors, were crucial to the city’s growth at the turn of the 20th century. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams Jake Pawlak answers a question from the media while Guillermo Velazquez listens on Feb. 3, 2025. “I'm a fourth-generation Polish American and fourth-generation Pittsburgher. If we were having this conversation in 1925 instead of in 2025, we'd be talking about my family's hardware store in Lawrenceville or their butcher shop in Polish Hill,” Pawlak said. Pawlak noted that around 10% of Pittsburghers were foreign-born as of the last census, including the city’s Bhutanese refugee community, growing Uzbek population, and the flourishing Hispanic and Latino community. Ruiz said Casa San José has gone from assisting 400 people per year before COVID to more than 6,000 in 2024, and the community center is working to expand its physical footprint as empty storefronts fill along Broadway Ave. in Beechview. While the political situation remains volatile, speakers said that, beyond A Day Without Immigrants, they encourage locals to support immigrant-owned businesses — and not to share potential misinformation. False secondhand reports of ICE raids have added to an already challenging situation. “I would highly encourage people not to share information unless it's valid because that's what's scaring people,” Ruiz said. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams A sign in PHDC headquarters The City of Pittsburgh is limited in the scope of what it can do, as ICE is executing civil, not criminal, warrants. Pittsburgh law enforcement doesn’t collect or share information on immigration status, and city officials find out about ICE actions as they happen. Pawlak said mis- and disinformation has also made it difficult to get an estimate on the total number of deportation raids — “I wouldn't want to hazard a guess, because I can't assure you that I can distinguish between rumor and fact,” he said. But city officials remain committed to supporting the local immigrant community. Velazquez and Ruiz both noted the essential role recent arrivals have played in contributing tax revenue, renovating aging buildings, enlivening business corridors, and helping the Steel City pivot to a post-industrial era. “It's a scare tactic to label people as criminals, when really, in fact, they're not. They're on the way to work, right?” Ruiz said. “Pittsburgh is an immigrant town. All of the bridges, all of the steel, all of the tunnels, were built by immigrants.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice Latest in Social Justice After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Feyisola Akintola is on a mission to make Pittsburgh more welcoming By Aakanksha Agarwal Feb 24, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 Ahead of a pending ceasefire, an Israeli and a Palestinian activist see a future together By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 16, 2025 More » More Social Justice All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

Donations to O’Connor’s campaign include $13,000 from employees of Walnut Capital and in-kind donations of catering from multiple individuals connected with Walnut Capital and other real estate firms. Many appear to have contributed during a Jan. 27 fundraiser that brought in over $90,000. Contacted by City Paper for clarification, O’Connor acknowledged the fundraiser and donations of catering. However, O’Connor also pointed out that incumbent Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey had also taken large donations from developers and construction firms. “He’s been taking money from them the entire time he’s been in office,” O’Connor tells CP, framing the revelations about donations as a “desperate move by the mayor’s office.” Gainey received a $2,900 donation from a Walnut Capital employee during his 2021 run for office, but his campaign verified for CP that the donation was immediately returned. However, Gainey's campaign did receive substantial contributions, including several “maxed-out” $3,300 donations, from employees of contracting and paving companies including Mistick Construction, Lindy Paving — which operates a large plant near Uptown and has frequently handled city paving projects — as well as several prominent Pittsburgh architects and employees of commercial realtor Burns Scalo. O’Connor’s list of donors, meanwhile, includes employees of construction company Mosites Co. and the families behind real estate firms Howard Hanna, Laurel Communities, and Lobos Management. In his capacity as county controller, O’Connor appeared with Laurel Communities principal and campaign donor Marty Gillespie at a groundbreaking for a luxury townhomes project in Duquesne Heights — a Laurel townhome in a similar Strip District development recently sold for $2 million. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Strip District Brownstones by Laurel Communities (left) On Jan. 27, O'Connor received donations totaling $5,000 from Bob and Linda Eckenrode and $3,330 each from five members of the Sobol family. The Eckenrodes own sizable holdings of South Oakland rentals and Uptown rowhouses. They and the Sobol family, who control Lobos Management, have been linked to resident complaints stemming from neglect, infestations, fire, allegedly unfair evictions, and a host of legal issues. CP contacted a former resident who didn't want their name used but called Eckenrode “the worst of all time,” citing their and friends' experiences in South Oakland. O’Connor tells CP that “that check [from Eckenrode] has been returned. As soon as we saw that donation, we sent it back.” Reached by phone for comment, Eckenrode said he was “not interested” in elaborating on his support for O’Connor. As Pittsburgh housing gets more expensive, policymakers and developers face a variety of local challenges, and the two Democratic candidates have staked out differing but similarly ambitious policy solutions. O'Connor has promised fixes to Pittsburgh's byzantine zoning laws, “encouraging housing abundance,” including affordable housing; and a greater focus on transit-oriented development. Gainey has supported regulatory policies including a voluntary rental registry and citywide inclusionary zoning (IZ), which the Pittsburgh Planning Commission advanced to city council following a marathon debate, as well as incentive programs such as OwnPGH. “We're in the dilemma that we are because we privatized so much housing and [have become] dependent on for-profit developers to build the housing that we need for our people,” housing justice advocate Randall Taylor tells CP. Taylor says he’s spoken with Gainey about increasing the public housing supply, establishing tenant cooperatives, and “making strides” in reforming the city housing authority. “The money that Corey O’Connor is getting, it seems to me to be directly saying … that we want for-profit developers to stay in charge,” Taylor says. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Abandoned houses in Uptown O’Connor characterized his opponent’s plans as one-size-fits all and emphasized a build-more-housing approach, noting his campaign chair, John Katz, builds and maintains affordable housing as part of Brandywine Communities and recently took a seat on a “healthy housing” board. O’Connor also highlighted his close involvement in the construction of affordable housing in the heart of Squirrel Hill, where he grew up, saying he’s “always been a supporter” of building affordable units. “We need a lot of affordable housing — this mayor has been so stagnant, it’s hurting all housing markets.” He also emphasized creating pathways to homeownership: “I’ve been saying it at every stump speech.” Regarding IZ, O’Connor says there’s some daylight between him and Gainey. “I supported IZ in Lawrenceville,” he tells CP. “Inclusionary Zoning is a tool we can use; however, the mayor’s office wants to implement a flat plan all across Pittsburgh. I cannot support that.” Both mayoral candidates seem to agree on one thing: Pittsburgh needs more places to live. Cities including Austin, Texas and Minneapolis, Minn. have eased their affordability crises by building thousands of units. Voters will get to sound off on whether they favor Gainey’s approach or O’Connor’s approach more on May 20. Taylor, for one, is hoping to see Pittsburgh lead the charge on building units that stay affordable for locals. “I would like the city to start talking about building thousands of permanently affordable, publicly-held, publicly-owned, operated, and maintained housing units,” he tells CP. “We don't need a Pittsburgh for some. We need a Pittsburgh for all.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Corey O'Connor, Ed Gainey, Randall Taylor, Walnut Capital, Lindy Paving, Bob Eckenrode, Lobos Management, inclusionary zoning Related Content ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Gainey calls out MAGA donations and O'Connor claps back as mayoral race heats up By Matt Petras Mar 3, 2025 After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Gainey, O'Connor clash on housing and Pittsburgh's budget in weekend debate By Laura Trybus Feb 3, 2025 Latest in Politics ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Trump’s policies and avian flu are driving egg prices up — and begetting plenty of memes By Colin Williams Mar 5, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

What does that mean for the neighborhood’s future? | News | Pittsburgh | Pittsburgh City Paper Pittsburgh City Paper Speculators have been holding onto hundreds of properties in Uptown for years. What does that mean for the neighborhood’s future? “Unfortunately, you still have bad landlords that still own large swaths of the neighborhood.” Ryan Deto Dec 13, 2017 6:00 AM CP photo by Ryan Deto 4 Seneca St. in Uptown has been owned by Bob Eckenrode since 2004. The property’s doors and windows are boarded up, and it has sat vacant for years. Uptown, a Pittsburgh neighborhood of fewer than 1,000 residents, is ready to explode. For decades, the neighborhood that abuts the Monongahela River between Downtown and Oakland, has been dominated by vacant buildings and parking lots. But with large development plans recently announced, Uptown is due for a huge transformation. UPMC is expanding its Mercy Hospital with a 300,000-square-foot vision-care center, and the Pittsburgh Penguins finally released plans for a massive, 28-acre mixed-use development in the adjoining Lower Hill District, right next to PPG Paints Arena. Additionally, regional leaders are promising that a modernized bus line will run through Uptown, which could drastically improve the landscape of the neighborhood’s two thoroughfares, Fifth and Forbes avenues. UPMC Mercy president Mike Grace told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in November that the hospital’s expansion will be “transformative for Uptown.” However, many Pittsburghers have likely heard this before. Starting around 2009, city leaders, developers and prominent thinkers dubbed Uptown the “next hot neighborhood.” The one-third-square-mile neighborhood checks all the boxes for a development tinder box: close proximity to the region’s two biggest job centers, Oakland and Downtown; affordability; great public transportation; and plenty of undeveloped land. But in the time since Uptown started receiving attention, neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and East Liberty have taken off and become hot housing and retail markets, while Uptown has remained mostly stagnant. Why didn’t Uptown take off too? Some nonprofits and public officials say that land speculators are to blame. A handful of people own hundreds of properties in Uptown. Critics say these property-owners are waiting for the market to catch fire to maximize their profits, but in doing so they are holding back the neighborhood by refusing to sell or renovate their properties. Real-estate developers, meanwhile, defend property-owners and say they are merely capitalizing on the current system. City leaders and nonprofits want to see Uptown become a neighborhood for all income levels and backgrounds, while property-owners are likely to cater to those who will cough up the most cash. And these differences have set up a battle to determine what Uptown will look like moving forward. “The future is bright for Uptown,” says Pittsburgh City Councilor Daniel Lavelle (D-Hill District), who represents Uptown. “Unfortunately, you still have bad landlords that still own large swaths of the neighborhood. They still hold most of the community back.” In 2014, Uptown was chosen by Portland, Ore.-based city-planning nonprofit EcoDistricts to participate in an “Eco-Innovation District” plan, which aims to develop the neighborhood into an inclusive place with great public transit, homes powered by green energy, and a commercial district filled with small businesses. Pittsburgh city planners, Uptown nonprofits and architects were provided training and resources on building an equitable neighborhood. CP photo by Jake Mysliwczyk This series of vacant rowhouses on Gist Street has been owned by Bob Eckenrode since 2005. The façades were recently given a new coat of paint. Jeanne McNutt, of nonprofit developer Uptown Partners, says her group has worked hard to bring more than 200 housing units to Uptown over the past several years. McNutt notes that Uptown has a large number of affordable-housing projects and, currently, one of the highest percentages of subsidized units of any neighborhood in Pittsburgh. However, McNutt worries that all of Uptown’s plans for equity could be jeopardized by the actions of land speculators, and of one in particular: Bob Eckenrode. The Mount Lebanon real-estate agent and landlord owns more than 40 properties scattered throughout Uptown. They are listed under his or his wife’s name, or those of his two limited-liability companies, BRGS and JCWS. Eckenrode has been buying property in Uptown since the early 2000s, according to property records. An analysis of Eckenrode’s Uptown properties conducted by Pittsburgh City Paper suggests a pattern. When Eckenrode purchases an Uptown property for more than $100,000, he usually rents out units in that building. When he buys buildings or parcels of land cheaply (typically for less than $50,000), he sits on them. Eckenrode currently owns at least 17 vacant properties in Uptown, which he purchased for a combined total of about $500,000; most of them have sat vacant for more than five years. Some properties have their windows and doors boarded up. Eckenrode has never sold a property in Uptown. And he’s not alone. Allegheny County property records show a dozen additional properties sitting vacant in Uptown that are owned by people who live outside the neighborhood. Eight of those were purchased more than 10 years ago. Many areas of Uptown are empty and blighted. McNutt believes this is compromising the neighborhood’s quality of life and is making it harder to develop Uptown. “Despite our good work to responsibly and equitably revitalize our neighborhood,” wrote McNutt in an email to CP, “the amount of vacant and boarded-up properties Mr. Eckenrode owns in Uptown continues to give a public impression of blight. Many millennials, immigrants, and others are eager to purchase an affordable home in Uptown to fix up for their own. Unfortunately, Mr. Eckenrode’s many vacant properties are not available because he will not sell.” CP reached Eckenrode by phone on Dec. 8, but he denied a request for an interview and didn’t want to comment for this story. Rick Schweikert, a Pittsburgh real-estate agent with the firm Keller Williams, has dealt with Eckenrode and other property-owners in Uptown. He doesn’t endorse Eckenrode’s and others behavior, but says that under the current system, they’re not doing anything wrong. “It is a free-market system, where anybody can buy any property they can afford,” says Schweikert. “They can be disposed of any way they want as long as it fits city-planning guidelines. Personally, I am very much in favor of government having a bigger say in how property is disposed of, but at the same time, we live in a capitalist system.” Under this system, it’s typically wealthy people who already own a lot of land who end up buying most of the properties in neighborhoods like Uptown. In Pittsburgh, this system is reaping huge benefits for real-estate developers. In the December 2016 issue of Pittsburgh Economic Quarterly, published by the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban Research, economist Chris Briem notes the meteoric rise of real estate as a popular and high-paying profession. From 2010 to 2014, according to U.S. Census figures, the Pittsburgh region saw an increase of 1,355 real-estate nonemployer filings, the most of any nonemployer sector. (Nonemployers are businesses with no paid employees; the real-estate sector includes both developers and landlords.) And in that same time period, property-owners and landlords pulled in hefty earnings, more than $98,000 a year on average. This is by far the highest earnings of any nonemployer sector in Pittsburgh. In Uptown, real-estate developer Sal Williams owns more than 100 properties. For years, Williams either demolished buildings to convert into parking lots or sat on the properties, waiting for the best moment to sell. Recently, Williams has started to sell many of his properties, and he is making a killing. In June, Williams sold four lots at the corner of Fifth and Pride to J&H Commercial Holdings. He bought the lots throughout the 1990s and early 2000s for a total $221,000, but sold them for $700,000. In 2015, Williams sold a large parcel to Uptown Associates for a $685,000 profit. That parcel became the upscale lofts Flats on Fifth. Schweikert admits it can be difficult for average residents to get their hands on affordable properties, but he says Pittsburgh officials need to pass laws that would help inexperienced buyers compete with the likes of Eckenrode. At the same time, Schweikert says that “a lot of properties would have just fallen to the ground” had it not been for developers like Eckenrode. For example, CP noticed that at least one of Eckenrode’s vacant properties, a rowhouse on Forbes, is undergoing rehabilitation. But City Councilor Lavelle feels some of those units currently held by speculators shouldn’t just remain at the mercy of property-owners in perpetuity. He says city government can help new homeowners buy and fix up properties thanks to Urban Redevelopment Authority programs that offer consolidation loans for purchase and rehab costs. But Lavelle says land speculators are repressing programs like these by purchasing many homes in soon-to-be desirable locations like Uptown. If speculators would look to sell some of their properties, says Lavelle, “One of the first things we would be able to do is rehab the vacant and abandoned buildings. And those buildings could become a wonderful entry point into Uptown for young families.” Lavelle says speculators appear to have “no concerns for the communities in which they own a lot property.” He adds that the URA would be happy to work with developers, and would even offer financial incentives and expertise, as long as developers are willing to work with the community. Currently, Lavelle says there is little the city can do to make speculators like Eckenrode work with the community, since Eckenrode is keeping his buildings up to code and paying his property taxes. (Eckenrode’s property taxes in Uptown range from highs of around $600 a year for large parcels to as low as $12 a year for some small buildings.) In the end, it might already be too late for a truly equitable Uptown. Schweikert says the odds are stacked against nonprofits, the city and even average buyers. He says property-owners have already purchased most of the best, affordable property in the neighborhood. The era of finding great deals in Uptown are waning. “I think it’s too late, there is nothing left,” says Schweikert. “Those days are gone in Uptown for sure.”"

The stakes for the candidates were high: the 14th ward is the largest ward in Pittsburgh, encompassing portions of six neighborhoods across the East End. The candidates not only need to win over the voters, but also the political committees. The candidate who wins over the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club and the 14th ward Democratic Committee receives dedicated volunteers, free mailers, and more. Ann Belser, the owner of Print newspaper, moderated the forum and didn’t let generalizations go unquestioned. Her first question about the effects of rapid gentrification became the focal point of discussion throughout the evening: “As rents have risen, an estimated 25% of units sit vacant because residents cannot afford the rent.” (Editor’s Note: Belser appears to have been referring to new developments in East Liberty specifically and cited a statistic from bestneighborhood.org. Following publication, CEO of Walnut Capital Gregg Perelman wrote Pittsburgh City Paper to note that the developer’s Bakery Living Blue property is over 98% occupied.) Incumbent Mayor Ed Gainey was passionate in painting a picture of his administration’s affordable housing agenda. “We have been laser focused on creating an affordable housing agenda. And the affordable housing agenda that we created is beginning to pay dividends,” he told the crowd. “Since 2022, we’ve built 2,000 units of affordable housing.” He credited Pittsburgh’s state delegation for making “amazing” progress and sealing 12 low-income housing tax credit deals in two cycles. The Gainey administration has received millions in funding from federal, state, county, and city funds to address issues due to COVID and the affordable housing crisis. The majority of those dollars have been spent to create affordable housing. Gainey also pointed to his administration’s work with state and county leaders on transit-oriented development. “We just got $600 million from the state thanks to Josh Shapiro, County Executive Sara Innamorato, and thanks to the business community downtown,” he said. County Controller O'Connor’s main point of contention was how the Gainey administration invested the COVID relief funds. “We had $340 million from COVID relief money that went to hiring 100 new employees in the city of Pittsburgh. Who's gonna pay for those hundred employees?” O’Connor accused Gainey of “wasting” money without a long-term plan and noted that the City of Pittsburgh has been renting trucks for public works. “I see Pittsburgh at a crossroads right now where we have to grow as a city and right now this city is not being held accountable. We have to be held accountable for the resources that aren't being given to neighbors and residents,” he said. O'Connor went on to question whether Pittsburgh is again headed for Act 47 status while Gainey vehemently denied the claim. Gainey and O'Connor, who had often been allies in politics, had differing views of which projects should have been funded. The back and forth was that of two people who had spent time with the budget and the city’s day-to-day operations. If one thing was clear by the end of the night, it was that these are two locals who love their city and will fight for it. The primary is set for May 20, 2025, with multiple Republicans vying for the GOP mayoral endorsement. A recording of the debate is available on YouTube.

Voters wanted lower inflation in 2024. Many of them cast their ballots for Donald Trump to return, perhaps thinking some combination of corporate deregulation and the second term president’s supposed business prowess would deliver us back to the halcyon days of $.99 eggs and gasoline. Trump certainly paid plenty of lip service to lower prices during the campaign. Instead, commodity prices are soaring, consumer confidence is in freefall, and, in classic 2025 fashion, the snarkier corners of the internet have a response: Trump take egg. The meme has spread especially fast on Bluesky, now home to millions of Twitter expats. The simple formulation of “Trump take egg” (also mirrored in “Trump crash plane,” “DOGE steal data,” and other tongue-in-cheek posts) seems designed to cut through online noise with a simple message, something Democrats have repeatedly failed to do. As egg prices soar, it’s also a message with potential for online resonance. Locally, Trump also “take egg” — while Greater Pittsburgh’s eggs are cheaper than the $8.07 national average, egg prices here are still north of $5 (Pittsburgh City Paper compared across multiple local grocers, including ALDI, Giant Eagle/Market District, and Whole Foods — $5.99 seems to be the current local median). Many stores, including Trader Joe’s, are unable to keep shelves full. Local diners have begun adding surcharges to offset soaring wholesale costs. In short, Trump take egg. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Empty egg shelves at Target. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Sparse egg shelves at Giant Eagle. The causes are the same locally as they are nationally: avian influenza, anxiety about tariffs, and corporate price gouging. Avian influenza (aka H5N1 or bird flu) could pose the most serious threat to the national egg supply, as well as the people who want more egg, but there’s good news in the short term for area residents, says Ronnie Das, Allegheny County’s public health information officer. While bird flu has definitely reached Pennsylvania and neighboring Ohio, as of this writing, “there have not been any known human cases of H5N1 in the county,” Das tells City Paper via email. “No animals in Allegheny [County] have tested positive for H5N1 to date.” There are some concerns — Das advises residents not to touch sick or dead wild birds and to report them to the PA Game Commission at 833-742-4868 or [email protected], who can test them for H5N1. He also suggests avoiding raw milk and other unpasteurized products, and keeping pet cats away from uncooked meat. “We recommend testing for any exposed persons who report symptoms or for exposed persons who were not wearing protective equipment at time of exposure,” Das adds. “[Allegheny County Health Department] can provide testing if [a] person doesn’t have easy access to [a] healthcare provider. ACHD monitors any exposed resident(s) daily for 10 days after last exposure.” ACHD continues to maintain a respiratory virus dashboard, which currently shows high rates of infection with influenza A. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Giant Eagle issues an apology for egg availability. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Giant Eagle issues an apology for egg availability. Bird migration and integrated supply chains means H5N1 is likely to stick around for a while in some form. However, shopping local could be one way to avoid exposure — and eat better to boot. “Wholesome food from small suppliers is far, far more resilient to outbreaks and supply-chain issues,” Chris Loughran of Chantal’s Cheese Shop tells CP. “We saw that through the pandemic, and that is true now. Of course, eventually, the further stripping away of what little exists of regulatory oversight of our food systems in favor of large-scale industrial agriculture will continue to do things like accelerate climate change and put more price pressure [on consumers].” Loughran also acknowledges that tariff “disgruntlement” could impact their imports, but, for now, he says smaller local businesses, including grocery service Harvie, have been able to keep egg prices stable. But restaurants, wholesalers, and shoppers at chain grocers will likely continue to feel the pinch of Trump taking egg. Even with locals studying a potential vaccine, H5N1 has continued to spread, and grocery store egg shelves remain stubbornly empty. That’s led to limits on purchases, consumer worries, and even ridiculous stunts such as realtors offering potential homebuyers eggs with their purchase. And, of course, “Trump take egg” memes from the Democratic National Committee on down. Come what may — a pandemic, full-blown fascism, or eggs at $10 a dozen — at least we’ll have something to laugh about while we wait for our $40 omelets.

Lee calls out \"prime minister\" Musk and \"king\" Trump in virtual town hall By Matt Petras click to enlarge Mars Johnson Rep. Summer Lee speaks to reporters at the Swissvale Food Pantry after voting in the 2024 Primary Election on April 23, 2024. Rep. Summer Lee told constituents the evening of Feb. 20 that Elon Musk has been acting like an unelected “prime minister” and pledged to fight against potential cuts to social programs and education through his Department of Government Efficiency. “[Musk] essentially bought his way, not just into [Trump’s] inner circle, beyond it, right into the Oval Office,” Lee says. “He is essentially working as if he is the prime minister of the United States, which tracks, as Donald Trump is now proclaiming he is the king.” The congresswoman’s team hosted a roughly one-hour “Tele-Town Hall” in which constituents could call in to listen and submit questions. Anyone interested could also listen live on Facebook, which about 100 people tuned into at a time. Lee, a Pittsburgh-area progressive often considered part of “the Squad,” represents residents in the City of Pittsburgh as well as parts of the South Hills and Mon Valley. Concerned constituents from areas such as Monroeville, Bloomfield, and Bethel Park all submitted questions answered by Lee. Throughout the stream, a member of Lee’s team read submitted questions regarding DOGE, a non-government entity created by President Donald Trump and run by Musk, who posted that he loves Trump “as much as a straight man can love another man” and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect him. Earlier this month, Congress’s Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which Lee is a member, unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena Musk. As explained by Trump and Musk, DOGE exists to assess spending by the federal government and kickstart actions to adjust spending. Critics fear such adjusting would amount to substantial cuts to programs such as Medicaid and Social Security that millions rely on for healthcare and income as well as broad, sweeping layoffs for federal workers to thwart the functioning of the federal government. Recently, seemingly prompted by Musk, Trump has effectively shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a department that amounts to less than 1% of the federal budget and disperses humanitarian aid to foreign countries. Attempts from DOGE to obtain a wide swath of citizens’ private data from the federal government has also sparked public controversy and scrutiny from courts. Lee said in the broadcast that the first month of the second Trump administration has felt like a year. She used strong language to describe the style of governing she believes Trump has been practicing. “I don’t believe that we can afford to mince many words,” Lee says. “President Trump is conducting an illegal and dangerous power grab, to call it what it is. Elon Musk is stealing from you, the American people, your jobs, your benefits, your data.” Later in the town hall, Lee added that it wasn’t “catastrophizing” to describe the United States as being in a “constitutional crisis.” Regarding the proposed abolishment of the Department of Education floated by Trump and his allies, Lee said it would be illegal for Trump to unilaterally end the department. “And that’s just wrong,” Lee says. “The Department of Education is there to ensure that all kids, all students, irrespective of their ZIP Code or their background, have access to a quality of education … it provides essential federal funding supporting our local school districts.” One constituent asked about the impact of mass layoffs of government workers within Lee’s district. Pennsylvania has about 56,000 federal government workers, including more than 8,000 in her district, according to Lee. “A lot of people, just across the country, feel like so much of the federal work happens only in D.C., and we know that that’s just not true,” Lee says. Lee also made it a point to criticize the impact of money on politics following the 2010 supreme court case Citizens United v. FEC. Large super PACs and deep-pocketed donors have spent gargantuan amounts of money to support candidates opposing Lee and her allies in Congress. “We have to speak out against dark money in politics … we shouldn’t accept it in any race because we know that it leads to this,” Lee says. “And we have to get back into the fight on messaging grounds. There are people who voted for Donald Trump, who voted for Kamala Harris or people who didn’t vote at all, who didn’t want this to happen. Who didn’t want the few, oligarchs, to run our country. And we have an obligation of helping them to understand what’s really happening.” Still, despite the severity of her description of current events, Lee promised to fight and encouraged her constituents to do the same. “I know you are discouraged. Some of you are confused or scared. Please do not give up,” Lee says. “Please do not feel like we are not in for this fight. I want to remind you it’s been 30 days. That’s it. It feels like a really long time, but it’s only been 30 days. We are in the first quarter ... There are more quarters to come, and we are all going to have to be ready for the fight, be ready for the advocacy, and be ready for the lobbying.” Slideshow Rep.

Lee calls Elon Musk an “oligarch” By Colin Williams click to enlarge The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. This story has been updated. Here we go again: the government is on the precipice of shutting down. Like the last shutdown six years ago — the longest in history — incoming U.S. President Donald Trump’s mercurial temperament and social media use played a key role in derailing a critical debt-ceiling bill at the 11th hour. This time, however, Trump was egged on by the newly emboldened Elon Musk, incoming chairman of the new Department of Government Efficiency. Employing over 100 posts on X (formerly Twitter), Musk almost singlehandedly swayed GOP sentiment against the bipartisan bill. Efforts to revive parts of it have since failed. Congresspeople, including Rep. Summer Lee (Pa.-12), remain stuck in Washington, D.C. while negotiations continue. “Elon Musk blew up the bipartisan-negotiated C.R. [continuing resolution] that we already had,” Lee tells Pittsburgh City Paper by phone from the Capitol. While options for a new bill have been floated, Lee says, “I think that what the Republicans are realizing is that they're not going to be able to pass a continuum resolution without Democratic votes.” The impasse points to Musk’s swift rise to the top of the MAGA pecking order — for now, at least. Musk “also tweeted out in those [posts] consistent disinformation about what was in this C.R., about the process of passing a budget of governing,” Lee says. “That's information that the American population are consuming at a time where, quite frankly, you know, they are vulnerable, because these are processes that have for so long been shrouded in mystery and backroom deals.” Lee says the move cements Musk’s status as an “oligarch.” The Tesla and SpaceX CEO’s net worth has skyrocketed to over $400 billion since Trump’s reelection on Nov. 5. Meanwhile, Pittsburghers are likely to feel the pinch in various ways. A government shutdown effectively freezes federal payroll and stymies agencies from the TSA to Veterans Affairs. Beyond parks and facilities in D.C., Pittsburghers collecting federal paychecks would see pay frozen mere days before the holidays. “When I think hyper-local, I think about the 8,000 to 10,000 federal employees that could go without a paycheck or be furloughed. I think about the thousands of people who rely on assistance such as WIC,” Lee tells City Paper. “That's 2,000 infants and children that would go without that critical program.” TSA and air traffic controllers, including those at the Pittsburgh International Airport, would also potentially be asked to work without pay, leading to long waits for holiday travelers. Lee, echoing White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, said the shutdown could also hamper a smooth transition between current President Joe Biden and Trump’s incoming administration. “Elon Musk inferring quite dangerously that we should pass nothing until Jan. 20 shows his lack of understanding of how the government actually works,” Lee says. “We can do no other business until we pass a budget.” Updated Dec. 20 7:00 p.m.: With 34 Republican defections, the House managed to pass the first continuing resolution Friday evening. “Democrats showed the country that we remain the party willing to unite to do our duty,” U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio said in a press release. “That is very different from House Republicans who, while in the majority party, keep falling into disarray and taking us to the brink.” Deluzio concurred with Lee in a post on X that the averted shutdown would have “hurt a lot of people in Western PA.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Summer Lee Related Content Rep.

There were shades of 2016 as the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election wound down in the early hours of Nov. 6. Democrats hoping for a victory from Vice President Kamala Harris were crushed after early optimism turned into a blowout for former President Donald Trump. Despite long lines and seemingly high turnout, Democrats fell far short of the total number of voters who elected Joe Biden in 2020 and lost the popular vote for the first time since 2004. While the Democrats sweated late returns in urban areas, Trump’s campaign was ebullient. The former President made inroads with young men, including some Hispanic and Black men, and hopes that poorly received rhetoric at his Madison Square Garden rally — which both attendees and opponents compared to a 1939 Nazi rally — would translate into high Puerto Rican turnout in particular turned out to be off base. Trump also drew support from women and Black voters, and early calls on states including North Carolina drastically narrowed Democrats’ path to a victory. Pittsburgh City Paper reported extensively on the shifting tides of Election Day at area watch parties and via nationally and locally reported election results following reporting on both candidates’ final pitches to the country at Steel City venues. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Point Park students watch Election Day returns on Nov. 5, 2024. Locally, Democrats performed well. Amid a sea of denim and navy sweaters peppered with union T-shirts at the Carpenters and Joiners union hall in Robinson, U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio supporters watched results come in to a soundtrack of Bruce Springsteen and union rally songs. “It’s going to be a long night, but I can promise you this: It’s trending in the right direction,” Darrin Kelly, president of the Pittsburgh Fire Fighters, said at the gathering. The race took until after midnight to call. “We’ve still got some ballots to count, but I think we’re gonna win this thing,” Deluzio told media shortly before the venue closed and guests were asked to leave. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colleen Hammond U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio addresses media as late election returns arrive on Nov. 5, 2024. Progressive U.S. Rep Summer Lee also prevailed easily in Pittsburgh and its eastern suburbs. Elsewhere, City Paper spoke with organizers nervous because of bomb threats (we plan more reporting on this soon). Democratic watch parties grew quiet as it became clear that some elements of the campaign, including reproductive healthcare, didn’t give the party as much of a nationwide boost as expected, including in Congressional races — it ultimately emerged that a more diverse, but more conservative, Senate would be in place for the next President, though votes in House races leave that picture less clear as of this writing. Whatever voters and party organizers expected, turnout in Allegheny County was extremely high, clocking in at around 74.6%. That apparently includes members of a coalition of voters for whom Trump’s hostile rhetoric, particularly on immigration and trans rights, is not only not a dealbreaking bug, but an attractive feature. MAGA politics’ wide acceptance in American politics will have implications for topics ranging from the violence in Gaza and Ukraine, abortion rights, judicial power, public education, and much more. In contrast to 2020, Pittsburgh's show of support wasn't enough to propel a Democratic repeat this cycle, and Trump and his ilk will now set many of the terms for the next one.

All eyes were on Pittsburgh as America’s two leading Presidential campaigns made their final pitches to voters here yesterday. It was a fitting end to an election cycle that saw both campaigns make multiple stops in and near the Steel City. Trump was shot at during a Butler rally that killed one onlooker. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris prepared for the only debate between herself and Republican nominee Donald Trump at a hotel downtown. Both made a point of returning to the area multiple times. And some Pittsburgh households have, by now, seen as many as 2,300 political ads this cycle. The candidates’ final rallies were initially both scheduled to take place in the middle of the city, with crews setting up a stage at Point State Park for Harris prior to that event’s being moved to Carrie Furnaces in Rankin/Swissvale. Trump spoke as planned at PPG Paints Arena, where curtains covered the upper bowl and some seats remained unfilled, but thousands waited for hours in line to attend. Both reflected the frantic nature of the major parties’ last push for voters in what’s widely viewed as a must-win state. Pittsburgh City Paper attended both and encountered very different atmospheres. While both rallies started and ran late, commonalities ended there — Trump’s final pitch to voters felt more like a fond farewell to the campaign trail and his previous administration, while Harris made a fleeting stop at a party-like gathering with local Democrats and pop singer Katy Perry. Trump organizers admitted tradespeople in hard hats first to create a backdrop for the former President at the arena in the Lower Hill. Vendors with hats, shirts, and flags lined both sides of Centre Ave. City Paper spoke with rally-goers who had driven in from as far away as New York and Michigan, some with children attending their first Trump rally. Inside, the mood was cheerful and the music loud. click to enlarge Trump was preceded first by area Republicans and police union representatives and then by GOP U.S. Senate nominee Dave McCormick, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Ark. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Disgraced former Pa. Senate candidate Sean Parnell, for one, criticized Harris as “less articulate than Joe Biden.” By far the loudest applause came when speakers delivered lines decrying illegal immigration or transgender participation in sports. At Trump's urging, attendees booed the press multiple times during the event. In between, the campaign played scattered clips of Harris and Trump while music blared (City Paper measured the volume during James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” and Black Eyed Peas’ “Let’s Get It Started” at over 115 decibels). Trump himself seemed as nostalgic as pugnacious — while he relished in branding opponents as “stupid” and seemed to take particular joy in disparaging the size and shape of U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California’s head, Trump said multiple times that it “was sad” that “after tomorrow, we won’t be doing this.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Donald Trump shares the stage with family members at a rally on Nov. 4, 2024 at PPG Paints Arena. Joining Trump on stage were conservative pundit Megyn Kelly, who added her share of transphobic remarks; Roberto Clemente Jr., who seemed to be supporting Trump due to his endorsement from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (whom Trump described as “so into women's health”); and several of his children and their partners, who gave no remarks. Trump also took a dig at Harris’ nearby rally, quipping, “We have more front-row Joes here than she's got at her big rally. She tried to get stars to come.” He later made a final stop in Michigan, driving through a cordoned section of Downtown on his way to the airport. click to enlarge CP Photo: Cameron Croston Kamala Harris speaks to supporters at Carrie Furnaces on Nov. 4, 2024. At Carrie Furnace, Harris spoke to a crowd that appeared younger and more diverse while Arie Cole and other locals performed and area politicians including U.S. Sen. John Fetterman spoke. Harris spoke for around 10 minutes after an awkward period without programming and focused on her agenda without saying her opponent's name. “Instead of stewing over an enemies list, I will spend every day working on my to-do list,” Harris told supporters. “Ours is not a fight against something, it is a fight for something … it is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body.” Afterward, Perry gave a performance, and the crowd headed back to a long line of waiting shuttles. Harris went to her final of eight rallies scheduled for the day. With campaigning now over, America heads to the polls. Pennsylvania — and Pittsburgh — will be top of mind for both campaigns, party diehards, and the national media. If nothing else, Nov. 4’s dueling rallies were indicative of the two very different major-party choices voters will find at the ballot box on Election Day.

Will it be enough? By Matt Petras click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Audience members at Harris rally in Pittsburgh Before the public began to arrive at Acrisure Stadium for the Oct. 15 rally for Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and Minn. Gov. Tim Walz, two people with the Kamala Harris campaign roamed the crowd and approached people for photo ops. One was a woman in pink clothing and a camouflage Harris Walz hat à la Chappell Roan, and the other was a man with a papier mache Walz helmet that at least a few in the crowd initially mistook for a likeness of Bernie Sanders. They circulated as about 500 people gathered inside the cold interior of the stadium — it felt like the 52 degree weather outside. Walz showed up about an hour late. He gave a familiar speech with his expected folksy charm, contrasting both his and Harris’ humble beginnings and the big plans they have for the country against the affluence and “concepts of a plan” of their opponents. His most notable flubs came when trying to ignore the three protestors removed from the event, at least two of whom were shouting slogans related to Gaza. One younger masked protestor yelling “Free Palestine!” caused Walz to temporarily stumble in confusion. After the rally, a few protestors yelled further about Trump. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson V.P. hopeful Tim Walz speaks in Pittsburgh. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The crowd goes wild as Tim Walz speaks in Pittsburgh. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson V.P. hopeful Tim Walz speaks in Pittsburgh. While Walz’s rally conjured up common concerns about the Harris campaign — a lack of enthusiasm, haphazard planning, conflict with the progressive base, etc. — other events have painted a much rosier picture. When former president Barack Obama spoke at the University of Pittsburgh on Oct. 11, he drew a crowd of more than 4,000 and brought the house down. Sen. John Fetterman also left the Pittsburgh area to join Harris in Erie, Pa. for a successful Oct. 14 rally complete with the dancing and cheers that elicited the kind of joy promised by the Harris campaign. As the election gets closer and closer, it appears only tighter and tighter. Even when optimistic in tone, Democrats have used events like these as an attempt to sound the alarm: if the party and its supporters aren’t diligent, Trump and the Republicans down ballot just might pull this thing off. It’s become a cliché since former president Donald Trump’s upset 2016 win in Pennsylvania and across the country that whoever wins this state wins the whole election. It’s not literally true, but it’s hard to imagine a candidate flopping in Pennsylvania somehow winning the presidency. At the very least, Pennsylvania is part of a group of about seven states that seemingly could go either way. Polling both in Pennsylvania and nationally have the two virtually tied — as of press time, Harris has a insubstantial lead nationally, and Trump has an insubstantial lead across the state, according to fivethirtyeight’s polling averages. The Walz rally seemed particularly attuned to the reality that Democrats need to fight hard in the Keystone State. Speakers before Walz, such as Mary Gibson, the Pa. Democratic Party’s deputy voter protection director, warned the crowd that, in 2020, despite comfortably winning the popular vote, President Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by an average of only about five votes per precinct. Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, whose politics seem mostly simpatico with Walz’s, emphasized the option of early voting. Wearing an “I Voted” sticker, she told the crowd that she dropped off her early ballot that day at Soldiers and Sailors in Oakland. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Audience members at Harris rally in Pittsburgh click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Audience members at Harris rally in Pittsburgh click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Protester outside Harris Rally in Pittsburgh “Allegheny County, we’re pretty important this election cycle,” Innamorato said. “The path to the White House runs right through Pennsylvania, and victory in Pennsylvania runs right through Allegheny County. We cannot grow weary in this battle. Our rights, our bodies, our future, are on the line. Freedom is on the ballot.” The left has regularly criticized Harris, Biden, and other Democrats for not sufficiently opposing the military actions of Israel, and this often materializes in the form of protests by young people. This issue seems particularly troublesome for Harris in Michigan, a swing state with a substantial Arab and Muslim population. Elsewhere, it’s a problem for Harris, but perhaps not a substantial one. According to a poll by GenFoward based out of the University of Chicago, about 10% of adults ages 18-40 planned to vote for Harris but have been dissuaded due to the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict, and just 2% identified “the war in Gaza” as the most important issue. And in one poll done by the progressive think tank Data for Progress, voters ages 18-29 trust Harris more than Trump the least on the issue of Israel-Palestine and also say they “don’t know” who to trust more on Gaza about double the amount of every other issue. Other state-level Democrats on the ballot include incumbent Senator Bob Casey, facing a challenge from businessman Dave McCormick, whose campaign has been plagued by accusations that it’s really most accurate to say he lives in Connecticut. Casey has appeared at various Democrat events, and his campaign hosted a Zoom press briefing on Oct. 14 with top national security experts admonishing McCormick for using his previous hedge fund to manage hundreds of millions of dollars of Russian debt. Other down-ballot Democrats have taken a more strident tone as a way to draw contrasts between themselves and their opponents. At an Oct. 23 evening event at Point Park University’s GRW Theater, former Auditor General Eugene DePasquale made himself available for a public “Ultimate Job Interview” hosted by Spotlight PA. Government Reporter Katie Meyer, along with two individuals who work outside of politics and reporting but who often conduct and prepare candidates for job interviews asked questions to DePasquale, Republican candidate Dave Sunday and Forward Party (yes, the Andrew Yang outfit) candidate Eric Settle. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Vice President Kamala Harris click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Vice President Kamala Harris click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Vice President Kamala Harris Unlike Sunday, who never discussed policy and sold himself as approaching the job apolitically, DePasquale advocated for a minimum wage increase, explained that better education and mental health services would do the most to prevent crime, and stated he would use discretion to refuse to ever prosecute a woman for having an abortion. This underscores DePasquale’s treatment of the AG role as more of a political position than a prosecutorial one, and it also snugly fits him into the national messaging of Democrats this election cycle: Republican extremism that threatens foundational freedoms and functioning of society needs to be met with an alternative. Media coverage following Obama’s appearance focused on his comments addressing hesitation about Harris potentially becoming the country’s first woman president. Other men, including Casey, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, and Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro, spoke before him to shore up support for Harris. “Part of it makes me think — and I'm speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president,” Obama said to the crowd. Obama overcame the enormous task of becoming the first Black president and ended up, since leaving office, becoming one of the most popular figures in American politics. Following Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016, anxiety about the role of sexism still pervades among Democratic operatives. At the same time, the reversal of Roe v. Wade and threat of further infringement of abortion protections has motivated more women to support Harris. At her rally in Erie, Harris entered by walking down a long, straight platform to Beyonce’s “Freedom” and waved to the crowd with a big, elated smile. A diverse crowd, young and old, Black and white, looked even more elated. For several seconds, she spun around and admired the crowd. “It’s good to be back in Pennsylvania!” Harris says. Toward the middle of her remarks, in between adoring interruptions from the crowd, Harris reminded attendees that much is on the line this cycle. “And we have to remember this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher because a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court just told the former president that he would essentially be immune from anything he does while he’s in office,” Harris says. “Now, just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Democratic Party, Tim Walz, Kamala Harris, Acrisure Stadium Related Content Where and how to have the best St. Patrick's Day celebration in Pittsburgh By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 For Democrats, shades of 2016 eight years on By Colin Williams Nov 7, 2024 Pittsburgh is the center of the political universe heading into Election Day By Colin Williams Nov 5, 2024 Pittsburgh’s top events: Oct. 24-30 By CP Staff Oct 23, 2024 Latest in Politics ACDC Endorsement Day featured a knife's edge mayoral vote and lots of judicial picks By Laura Trybus Mar 10, 2025 Mayoral candidates point fingers on developer donations and affordable housing By Colin Williams Mar 10, 2025 Trump’s policies and avian flu are driving egg prices up — and begetting plenty of memes By Colin Williams Mar 5, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

Two people including the shooter are dead, and two more locals were seriously injured. For his part, Trump was well enough to post on social media, and his allies fueled uncorroborated speculation he was golfing mere hours after being shot. He’s now bound for Milwaukee for this week’s Republican National Convention. If you were out of cell service, avoiding the news, or otherwise occupied, you likely found out about all of this through a fusillade of group texts. News of the assassination attempt has been moving quickly, with updates about the perpetrator and victims emerging through a haze of social media speculation. If you’re overwhelmed or just getting caught up on these shocking events as the week begins, here’s what you need to know: What happened? A little after 6 p.m. on Sat., July 13, Trump took the stage at a well-attended and stiflingly hot campaign rally on the grounds of the Butler Farm Show. Meanwhile, a person in a gray shirt was seen acting suspiciously on the property of an adjacent manufacturer and then using a ladder to climb a nearby building. About 10 minutes into Trump’s speech, while he was discussing illegal border crossings, a series of loud pops rang out. Live video captured Trump grabbing his ear and ducking to the ground before being swarmed by Secret Service agents. Trump later said he was struck in the ear by a bullet, not glass teleprompter fragments as some internet sources have claimed. Within about 15 seconds, police fatally shot the person on the rooftop. Trump was captured in striking photographs raising a fist and exhorting his supporters to “fight” as Secret Service agents rushed him from the scene. As rallygoers and media members fled, it quickly became apparent that several others were shot in addition to Trump. click to enlarge Google Maps/CP Illustration: Colin Williams The shooter and Trump's approximate locations on and around the Butler Farm Show grounds at 6:10 p.m. Jul. 13 U.S. President Joe Biden called his opponent to offer his sympathies, and he and other national leaders all released statements deploying the shooting and pledging scrutiny of the security at Trump’s rally. Social media quickly filled with conspiracy theories about the shooting, with many leftwing sources proclaiming their skepticism about the legitimacy of the assassination attempt. Information and conspiracies also quickly began to emerge about the alleged perpetrator and his background. Who’s responsible? The rooftop shooter has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park. Classmates described Crooks as quiet and conservative. Multiple sources say he was a good student who worked in a local nursing home. Though he was apparently barred from a school rifle club for being a bad shot, he later joined another gun club in Clairton. At the time he was killed, Crooks was also wearing a shirt from Demolition Ranch, a popular gun-themed YouTube channel. Crooks’ politics have fueled rampant speculation, and his motive remains unclear. Though a registered Republican, Crooks donated $15 to a progressive voter rights organization on the day of Biden’s inauguration. Crooks’ social media has also revealed little, fueling speculation about whether or not he was motivated by far-right conspiracies. What is known is that Crooks used his father’s AR-15 in the shooting. Crooks’ parents were apparently a registered Democrat and Libertarian. Their home in Bethel Park was the scene of a media frenzy on Sunday, and it emerged that the family were neighbors of Allegheny County councilmember Dan Grzybek, who expressed his shock at the coincidence and sympathies to those affected. click to enlarge Google Maps/CP Illustration: Colin Williams Except Trump, everyone involved with and killed or wounded in the shooting was from Western Pa. Who got hurt? In addition to Trump’s injury, Corey Comperatore of Buffalo Township was fatally shot after reportedly shielding his wife and two daughters from gunfire. David Dutch of Plum remains in a medically induced coma after undergoing surgery to remove bullets from his torso. James Copenhaver of Moon Twp. was also shot but is now in stable condition. Neighbors and colleagues of Comperatore described the Butler County man as an upstanding community member — he previously served as chief of a local volunteer fire department. A GoFundMe for Comperatore’s family with ties to Trump’s campaign has received $3 million and counting from donors including prominent conservative influencers. What’s next? Biden and other Democrats universally condemned the shooting, with the President urging Americans to “cool it down” amid a tense election cycle. Trump likewise called for the country to “stand united” against political violence (stock in his media company also spiked on news of his survival). However, some Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters took to the airwaves to blame Democrats and Biden in particular for the assassination attempt. Greater Pittsburgh finds itself once again the center of unpleasant news just as the presidential election has hit a new phase of uncertainty. Following a widely panned debate performance, Biden has lost ground to Trump in polls, and the latter’s supporters appeared galvanized by his brush with death. It remains to be seen how the assassination attempt will change either candidate’s numbers in the days ahead. In short, the deadly shooting in Butler has taken a chaotic election — one that was already going to have a Pennsylvania focus, given the commonwealth's battleground status — and added a dangerous new element. Unfortunately, the lives of many locals will also never be the same because of it.

Rotenstein on Thu, Mar 6, 2025 at 6:00 AM click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein The former Donny's Place building on Herron Ave. The Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission (HRC) failed to reach consensus Mar. 5 on whether the former Donny’s Place gay bar should be designated as a City of Pittsburgh historic site. Once a hub of LGBTQ nightlife and public health research in the early stages of the HIV/AIDS crisis, the former Donny’s Place is on track to become the first officially recognized LGBTQ landmark in Southwestern Pennsylvania. However, without a positive HRC recommendation, that path becomes more difficult — Pittsburgh City Council will now have 120 days after a City Planning Commission hearing to decide the property’s fate. Lizzie Anderson and Matthew Cotter collaborated with writer Dade Lemanski and Preservation Pittsburgh to research and write the nomination submitted to the HRC last October. The nomination makes the case for preserving Donny’s Place because of its ties to important events and people: LGBTQ history, public health initiatives during the HIV/AIDS crisis, its associations with owner Donald Thinnes, and as a familiar visual feature in the Polish Hill neighborhood. Queer history under fire After Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the federal government has commenced a concerted effort to erase all recognition of trans and queer culture from federal agencies and websites. In February, historians began posting on social media that reports and articles they had written for federal agencies had been edited to remove references to trans people or that they had been deleted altogether. By Feb. 20, the National Park Service had deleted a 32-chapter LGBTQ Heritage Theme Study it published in 2016. “There was a possibility that Trump would win,” says Anderson. “And we knew there was all of this rhetoric around the country demonizing trans children, especially parents, athletes, any person who just is living their lives and had some modicum of safety or we were building some modicum of safety.” But the speed and breadth of the new administration’s actions have been shocking. Anderson thinks the recent moves to erase LGBTQ people and their histories underscore the need to preserve Donny’s Place. “We knew there was a possibility all of this could come to a head, but honestly I didn't know it would be like it is now. And it's terrifying and it's rage filled. I feel rage filled,” says Anderson. “There's really something about the building itself — and the safety and life and possibility and passion and desire and just normal actions of going to a bar with your friends and being able to be exactly who you were there — that continues to feel incredibly salient.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein The former Donny's Place on Herron Ave. at the foot of Polish Hill A contested present and future In February, the HRC determined that the nomination was viable, i.e., that it meets at least two criteria for designation: for its ties to a significant person (Thinnes) and its ties to Pittsburgh’s LGBTQ culture. A property must meet one out of ten criteria to be designated a city historic site. Jonathan Kamin, an attorney representing the Thinnes estate and developer Laurel Communities, told the HRC in February that his clients had filed a lawsuit against the two nominators, Lizzie Anderson and Matthew Cotter. The suit alleges that the nomination is a smokescreen for Polish Hill residents opposing the development. The complaint filed in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas charges that Anderson and Cotter are engaging in a “concerted effort to illegally interfere with the development of the property.” Anderson says that she and Cotter have hired an attorney. She describes the complaint as a SLAPP, a strategic lawsuit against public participation. “We feel confident we have and will continue to just be exercising our rights of free speech and our abilities to be able to petition the city about our desires for our neighborhood and also this building in particular,” says Anderson. She noted that Governor Josh Shapiro signed legislation last year protecting citizens against SLAPPs. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Attorney Jon Kamin speaks during a Historic Review Commsision meeting regarding Donny's Place on Mar. 5 2025. Pro-Housing Pittsburgh, a local chapter of YIMBY Action, also opposes the designation. “The present nomination is wholly intended to halt the redevelopment of the parcel,” wrote Pro-Housing Pittsburgh founder David Vatz in a statement submitted to the HRC ahead of the hearing. Anderson and Cotter rallied 100 people to write letters to the HRC supporting the nomination. Most of the letters came from members of Pittsburgh’s LGTBQ community and the Polish Hill neighborhood. Besides Vatz and the attorneys representing the developer and the Thinnes estate, four people also submitted statements opposing the nomination. One of them was a former Donny’s Place bartender. Anderson and Lemanski, appearing via Zoom, made a brief presentation to the HRC, recapping the site’s history with slides using Heinz History Center archives photos in the Donald Thinnes collection. Kamin, appearing in person, then distributed copies of a structural engineer’s report, Thinnes’ will, and other documents to the HRC. He demanded an opportunity to question Thomas Yorgy, the real estate professional who helped Thinnes assemble 34 Polish Hill parcels and whom Thinnes named as his executor. Citing the city’s historic preservation law, Kamin also asked to cross-examine the nominators, Anderson, Cotter, and Lemanski. In a contentious exchange in which the nominators would only answer questions about the property’s history and the nomination, Kamin repeatedly asked about their previous statements at a December 2024 development activities meeting and last month’s viability meeting. The nominators declined to answer those questions on advice of counsel because of the pending litigation. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Jon Kamin and Thomas Yargo speak during a Historic Review Commsision meeting regarding Donny's Place on Mar. 5 2025. The HRC heard from Preservation Pittsburgh’s Melissa McSwigan and Polish Hill resident and former Donny’s Place patron Caleb Gamble in support of the nomination. Jack Billings said that he opposed the nomination. “I’m a member of the Pittsburgh Queer Kink Community,” Billings said. He told the HRC that he had attended events at Donny’s Place and that the nominators had never reached out to the Pittsburgh Queer Kink Community about the nomination. Billings is also a member of Pro-Housing Pittsburgh. “This is a transparent attempt by people in Polish Hill who don’t want there to be development at Donny’s Place,” he said via Zoom. Unable to agree After closing testimony, the HRC debated whether the former Donny’s Place meets the criteria for designation as a historic site. Discussion centered on the two criteria recommended in the viability meeting. Chairperson Lucia Aguirre argued that the property meets at least one criterion, as a culturally significant place in Pittsburgh history. She cited the 100 letters supporting the nomination and the building’s compelling history. Aguirre said that the site should be preserved because it tells the story of a historically marginalized group of Pittsburghers. “I don’t want to be a part of that erasure,” she said. Commissioner Richard Snipe didn’t find anything significant about the property and he made a motion to forward a negative recommendation to Pittsburgh City Council. Aguirre, unable to second the motion because she is the chair, couldn’t find a second for the motion. Planning Department staff advising the HRC reminded them of a third option in the city’s law: to forward no recommendation at all. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Historic Review Commission hold a meeting on Mar. 5, 2025. Snipe withdrew his earlier motion and made a new one to forward no recommendation. That motion passed with three commissioners — Snipe, James Hill, and Karen Loysen — voting in favor and one (Aguirre) against it. Commissioner Katie Reed abstained and Commissioner Mattew Falcone had recused himself ahead of the hearing. Commissioner David Green was not present. The HRC hearing is the first step in a three-part process. The nomination next goes to the City Planning Commission. There, commissioners will take into account the property’s history and how a potential designation might impact the city’s planning and land use objectives. The HRC and Planning Commission decisions are advisory. The final decision rests with City Council. The 120-day clock for councilors to decide on Donny’s Place’s fate begins after the Planning Commission vote. Councilors will decide if Pittsburgh will get its first LGBTQ historic landmark. No date has been selected for the Planning Commission hearing.

LGBTQ older adults navigate life with multiple marginalized identities and unique challenges. Compared to their cisgender and heterosexual peers, LGBTQ elders are twice as likely to live alone, four times less likely to have children, and more likely to experience poverty, homelessness, and poor physical and mental health, according to SAGE, a national advocacy group for LGBTQ elders. Community resources are vital for populations at higher risk for loneliness, isolation, and other challenges. One new resource coming to Pittsburgh’s queer elder community this year is Mosaic Apartments, an LGBTQ friendly senior living center, set to open in October. All 48 units are dedicated to income-eligible seniors. The Oakland-based senior living community is the first of its kind in Western Pennsylvania and second in the state. Jim Pieffer, President and CEO of Presbyterian SeniorCare Network, says focus groups with LGBTQ older adults were crucial during the planning phase. “What we heard from the focus group was: ‘We want a place where we feel welcome, where we don’t feel like we have to re-closet, where we feel accepted.’ And that’s hopefully the environment that we’ll be able to create there,” Pieffer says. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The Persad Owls, an LGBTQ senior group, discuss the current political climate on Feb. 6, 2025. Mosaic Apartments hopes to serve as a national model for LGBTQ senior communities, with culturally competent, specially trained staff, wellness and education programming, and other services to meet community needs. Pieffer anticipates that most residents will either be a member of the LGBTQ community or an ally. Applications for Mosaic Apartments will open six months prior to occupancy, likely in April or May. More than 120 prospective residents have already expressed interest via an inquiry form. While Mosaic Apartments will be a novel resource for LGTBQ seniors in Pittsburgh, other established, longstanding services exist. The Persad Center, for example, based in Lawrenceville, serves LGBTQ people of all ages in the region, with dedicated senior programs, as well as mental health services. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The construction site of the Presbyterian Senior Care Network's LGBTQ-friendly apartments click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The construction site of the Presbyterian Senior Care Network's LGBTQ-friendly apartments click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson The construction site of the Presbyterian Senior Care Network's LGBTQ-friendly apartments “As the second-oldest LGBTQ+ mental health counseling center in the U.S., we’ve been here for the community for 53 years for anyone who needs someone to talk to,” Persad Center CEO Marty Healey tells Pittsburgh City Paper. More than 450 people receive weekly outpatient counseling at the Persad Center, many of whom are seniors. Every Thursday from 10 a.m. to noon LGBTQ adults age 50 and up, are invited to attend Coffee and Conversations held by OWLS, the senior support group at Persad. “We try to offer a welcoming, inclusive environment for our seniors to gather, to share things that are important to them, and hear other perspectives from other seniors who are part of the community,” says Healey. Healey, an LGBTQ older adult himself, says isolation, loneliness, and acceptance are the biggest challenges faced by the community. “In running the agency for the past four years, [I] know that during the darkest hours of our community, our senior programming stayed vibrant and did nothing but grow,” says Healey. Additionally, the Persad Center hosts three social support groups for the transgender community, a community food pantry, and, soon, an LGBTQ-specific grief group. Many older adults, queer or not, struggle after the death of a partner. Yet, “in a world where our community members sometimes — or a lot of times — feel isolated and alone, that grieving becomes all the more accentuated and problematic for them,” explains Healey. In traditional grief support groups, LGBTQ adults may feel othered or misunderstood. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Persad Center CEO Martin Healy attends an Owls LGBTQ 50 and up meeting on Feb. 6, 2025. “Some of the nuances of being a member of the LGBTQ+ community are different … The grieving may feel a bit different. And it’s okay if it does,” Healey says. “It’s healthy to find an alternative, and we want to provide that alternative.” For some, dealing with these challenges has become more trying in their later years. “With the trans community being so thoroughly vilified by the Republican Party in this last election cycle, all trans people, no matter their age, are at risk like never before,” says Kelly McElhattan, a 68-year-old trans woman living in Shaler Township. “I can’t believe I’m alone in feeling more vulnerable and under threat,” she adds. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Persad Center CEO Martin Healy poses for a portrait on Feb. 6, 2025. “I’m too old to spend the rest of my life fighting the hate this country is drowning in,” McElhattan says. McElhattan is retired, her partner recently passed away and she faces harassment — all of which have led her to consider moving out of the U.S. Healey acknowledged the struggles LGBTQ older adults continue to face. “Interestingly enough we've had a lot of requests from some of our younger community members to talk to our senior community members,” says Healey. “The younger folks want to talk to the older folks, especially during the tough times right now, hear their experiences and understand what they've been through.” He adds, “Our seniors have been through a great deal of things throughout their lives. And I think right now especially, they're able to shed light on the hope needed to get through this current time and move forward.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags LGBTQ, Persad Center, Presbyterian SeniorCare Network, Mosaic Apartments Related Content Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Food Service Workers for Veggies N’at, Seasonal Park Rangers, a Director of Marketing, and more By Morgan Biddle Feb 26, 2024 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Mental Health Therapist, Ice Cream Maker, Arcade Manager, and more By Morgan Biddle Jan 8, 2024 Here’s what local Pittsburgh nonprofits actually need this season By Rachel Wilkinson Nov 8, 2023 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Jail Oversight Board Liaison, Art Handler, and more Curated by Lisa Cunningham Oct 2, 2022 Latest in LGBTQ Donny’s Place hits a snag on the way to becoming Pittsburgh’s first LGBTQ historic site By David S.

As Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon continues to claim lives and fuel regional unrest, a local group is calling out one Pittsburgh company’s role in the war effort. Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Pittsburgh protested Dec. 2 outside the headquarters of Howmet Aerospace in a bid to get Howmet not to renew a contract with defense giant Lockheed Martin. Howmet manufactures parts for jet engines and aircraft — that includes titanium components used in the Lockheed Martin-built F-35 Lightning II fighter jet, which the U.S. has sold to allies worldwide, including Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently operates at least 39 of the technologically advanced jets and plans to acquire a total of 75 by 2028. Without the parts Howmet makes, members of a local coalition of activists supporting BDS of Israel say the IDF would have greater difficulty acquiring and repairing its F-35s. Reports have found credible evidence that the IDF flew its F-35s in attacks on civilian “humanitarian zones,” recently prompting the Supreme Court of the Netherlands to call for a ban on the export of Dutch-made parts used in the Lightning II. Matt Fiorillo of BDS Pittsburgh said in an interview before the protest that the group hopes “to get them to stop their dealings with Lockheed Martin and put a small, little wrench in the ability for the U.S. to continue supporting Israel's genocide.” (Pittsburgh City Paper reached out to Howmet for comment, but we did not hear back by press time. BDS Pittsburgh activists say the company has ignored multiple calls and letters, including a petition, from the group.) click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson A Howmet employee looks out at the protestors gathered outside on Dec. 2, 2024. Howmet’s recent emergence as a standalone company came with controversy, and its relationship with Lockheed Martin has not been frictionless. Acquired by Alcoa in 2000, Howmet was spun off by Alcoa's successor Arconic in 2019. This occurred after Arconic’s reputation suffered following the company’s role in the deadly 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London. Then, the company and Lockheed Martin fell out over their 2024 F-35 contract. “The price of titanium was fluctuating a lot, which led to a price dispute between Howmet and Lockheed,” Fiorillo said. “Lockheed sued Howmet for refusing to deliver the titanium parts for the F-35 that they were under contract to deliver, and Howmet claimed that Lockheed had broken their side of the contract.” The two companies eventually settled, but the lawsuit made details of their contract — and the important role of Howmet's parts in the F-35 — public. BDS activists say that, with the contract due to expire at the end of the year, now is the time for public pressure. “Obviously, none of us are able to boycott either Lockheed Martin or Howmet,” activist Mel Packer told City Paper. “But without the parts they supply, this jet cannot even fly.” Packer said he’s hopeful that calling attention to Howmet’s military-industrial ties could also draw scrutiny of their local charitable activities, which Packer called “greenwashing” of its reputation. Activist Emily De Ferrari said BDS Pittsburgh hopes to raise awareness with the public beyond the philanthropic community, as well. “The other goal is simply an educational goal,” De Ferrari said. “We [Pittsburghers] are not aware how much the war machine, and, specifically, the war in Gaza is intertwined into our community.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Palestine supporters gather outside of Howmet Aerospace on the North Side to protest the company's involvement in providing parts for F-35 jets on Dec. 2, 2024. With that goal in mind, a few dozen activists gathered outside of Howmet’s headquarters on the Allegheny River on a cold Monday to protest. “The reason we’re really here is because of the disproportionate response Israel has had in Gaza,” demonstrator Juliana, who didn’t give a last name, told City Paper as others chanted. “We don’t want Pittsburgh to be part of the genocide, especially in that kind of intimate way where [Howmet is] actually making parts for these killing machines,” said demonstrator Dan Kovalik, who published a book, The Case for Palestine, on the region’s importance earlier this year. He urged Howmet to reconsider working with Lockheed Martin. “Their contract’s up in about 30 days,” he said. “We’d like them to find peaceful ways to make a profit.” Demonstrator Ilan Magnani urged those who feel the same to join the local movement. “There’s a thousand different ways to plug in in Pittsburgh,” they told CP, calling the Pittsburgh Palestine Coalition a “hub” for the movement heading into 2025. For those opposing Israel’s actions but unconvinced by BDS, Packer points to a number of past examples of effective boycotts, including the ones leading to Strauss Group’s recent sale of Sabra hummus and SodaStream’s 2015 withdrawal from the occupied West Bank. “There’s been significant victories,” Packer told CP. He describes himself as a “realistic optimist,” and De Ferrari says she feels similarly. “When the Berlin Wall fell, I had no idea it was going to fall. When Nelson Mandela was released from prison, I had no idea that that was coming,” she said. “I just wonder if this will follow that same trajectory — it looks horrible, and then, all of a sudden, there's breakthroughs. So that's a way that I keep hope.” Slideshow Hundreds of Protesters march downtown on President's Day Click to View 21 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Howmet Aerospace, BDS Pittsburgh, Matt Fiorillo, Mel Packer, Emily De Ferrari, Dan Kovalik, Ilan Magnani Related Content Schenley Park's veiled Columbus statue is losing its covering as legal challenges hold up removal By Matt Petras Jun 26, 2023 Edgar Thomson Works: Source of good jobs or bad air?

Separated by 3,000 miles, the vacated housing structures in each case tell stories of inequity. But it’s the role played by Pittsburgh-based manufacturer Arconic that has drawn Ivey’s attention to the Grenfell Tower, a 24-floor building that erupted in flames on June 14, 2017. Ivey’s particularly concerned that the company’s suspected culpability hasn’t raised enough attention around the Steel City. And in an effort to remedy that, he will be driving a mobile van around Pittsburgh on Sat., June 11, projecting clips from his new documentary, asking: “Hey Pittsburgh, did you know Arconic is responsible for this?” Headquartered on the North Shore, Arconic is a global corporation that produces a range of metal products for industries including construction, automotive, and aerospace. Ivey was visiting London to work on another project when he learned that Arconic had manufactured the aluminum paneling believed to have contributed to the fire’s rapid spread. Since the fire, Arconic has ceased producing the paneling products used in the Grenfell Tower, citing complications with international building codes and the ongoing fallout of the London disaster. U.S. regulations already prohibited the use of the material as a construction material for residential buildings. Ivey says this confirms the company knew of the risks but chose anyway to exploit an open business opportunity. “People always try to get away with what they can until they get caught,” he says. Arconic did not respond to a request for comment on the contents of Ivey’s film. A U.K. civil service inquiry into the causes of the fire has produced pages of findings but remains ongoing. Claude Schmidt, president of Arconic’s French division where the Grenfell components were made, acknowledged when questioned for the inquiry he “hadn’t made it a priority” to learn about safety testing procedures prior to the fire. Seizing on this, U.S. shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the company for mishandling safety procedures, which they say inflicted financial losses. To Ivey, discussions about profit and loss simply deflect from the human cost at the heart of his documentary, adding, “They talk about record profits, but did they care about record deaths?” Ivey says survivors who he interviewed remain traumatized, and are frustrated that no one has been held responsible. “[Arconic has] ducked and dived and wrangled their way out with their billions,” laments one survivor featured in the film. While the inquiry continues along, buildings built with the same Arconic paneling product remain standing throughout the country. Ivey intends for his film to have a big impact in Pittsburgh, but he has no plans to screen it in the U.K. “The work I’ve shown here, I would never want to show in the U.K. … because it would just be too traumatic for the communities,” he says.

By Jamie Wiggan click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham A proposed air quality permit that’s been two years in the making is dividing Mon Valley residents over whether the Edgar Thomson Works is primarily a source of good jobs or bad air. The U.S. Steel facility in Braddock is the largest remaining blast furnace site in the region, producing around 2.9 million net tons of raw steel each year. Accompanying this output are hundreds of well-paying jobs, but also hundreds of tons of annual emissions like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide. These competing stakes were the focus of an Allegheny County Health Department hearing on June 29 to gather public input before approving the new permits. About 80 attended, and 39 were listed to speak. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jamie Wiggan Protesters march through Braddock before a hearing on Edgar Thomson Works on Wed., June 29, 2022. A small crowd of protesters assembled before the event and marched through the streets of Braddock brandishing signs with messaging including, “We wish you weren’t here E.T.” and “Get out or clean up.” One of the protesters, Caroline Mendis, lives in neighboring Swissvale but has deep family ties to Braddock, where her grandfather was a Lutheran pastor. Mendis says since developing amyloidosis of the lung several years ago, she’s become more attuned to air quality and its impact on breathing. “It just made me very conscious of breathing like it never did before,” she told Pittsburgh City Paper. While Mendis remembers her parents changing clothes during the day because they would become stained with the thick soot that once hovered over the Steel Valley, she believes the visibly cleaner air surrounding the region doesn’t necessarily mean all the risks have been similarly diminished. Testifying later during the ACHD hearing, pediatrician Deborah Gentile said smaller invisible particles known as PM 2.5 particulates are in fact among the most deadly of manufacturing pollutants. “It's established as fact that air pollution causes health effects,” Gentile said. “Short-term and long-term exposure to PM 2.5 particulate matter causes death.” Many critics of the plant say these environmental and health costs don’t need to be the accepted price for ensuring good jobs, and they blame the corporation for failing to invest in its aging facilities. “It's time to discard the narrative that it's necessary to poison residents so that steel workers can keep their jobs,” Braddock resident Edith Abeyta said during the ACHD hearing. David Berthenthal of Greenfield argued similarly that U.S. Steel is exercising a choice not to invest more in the plant to reduce harmful emissions. “U.S. Steel has the revenue to upgrade their plans, they just don't want to,\" Berthenthal said. \"Their plan is to wring every dollar out of their decrepit plant at the cost of our health, including the skilled workers at the plants.” The proposed permit calls for investments in pollution monitoring equipment and for a third-party study that may prompt further upgrades. Last year, U.S. Steel suddenly announced it was stepping back from a $1 billion plan to improve its emissions controls at the neighboring Clairton Coke Works, and instead scaled back its operations. Mel Packer, a Pittsburgh resident and former steel worker, said this fits into a steady wave of disinvestment he’s witnessed since he first moved to the area, and which he said shows the company’s loyalties lay elsewhere. “[U.S. Steel] is keeping dinosaurs operating with Band-Aids, duct tape, and piano wire, and it's lying to all of us about its future,” he told the health department. Supporters of the plant, including Braddock Mayor Delia Lennon-Winstead, meanwhile say the terms of the proposed permit are too harsh and risk job losses that would harm the community. “U.S. Steel is Braddock, and Braddock is U.S. Steel,” Lennon-Winstead said, testifying to notable decreases in visible pollution during her lifetime. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jamie Wiggan A hearing on Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock Wed., June 29, 2022. Others, including Mark Yezovich, a maintenance manager at Edgar Thomson, say the health department needs to give more concessions to U.S. Steel to ensure it can afford to keep up its payroll. “These are our jobs, and we need these jobs in our community,” said Yezovich, who said he went to work in the mill after graduating from college because it offered the best employment option. “Therefore, I encourage you, the Allegheny County Health Department, to work in a more collaborative way with us still to work on a fair permit that doesn't discourage or jeopardize good paying, family sustaining jobs.” Union president Michael Evanovich said the fact that workers like him can tolerate the conditions inside the mill for decades-long careers suggests the environmental impacts raised by the critics are exaggerated. \"There are people that have to go in there to work to make a living,\" Evanovich said. \"They're not just living here, they’re inside the heart and soul of the mill, and if it was that bad, I don't believe they would keep their jobs.” The permit negotiations closely follow a court agreement between U.S. Steel and environmental regulators that spelled out $1.5 million in fines against the corporation for a string of violations dating between 2014-2018. The new Title V permit currently under consideration would set out the terms by which future violations and fines will be measured and enforced. In an email statement provided to Pittsburgh City Paper, U.S. Steel accuses the ACHD for not working “collaboratively” with the company on the terms of the permit. “We respectfully disagree with the ACHD’s creation of approximately 100 new emission limits that were not previously included in the existing Title V Operating Permit, any underlying installation permits, or that are otherwise required by any regulation.” A statement from ACHD says the department will consider all public input before issuing a final permit to U.S. Steel. \"When the public comment period ends, we will evaluate and consider all public comments and then review the proposed revisions to ensure that the language is clear,\" according to the statement. \"The ACHD has made great strides at improving the area’s air quality over the past several years, but we understand that there is still work to be done. Our goal is to ensure that the final Title V permits issued for the facility will do just that, particularly for those who may be the most vulnerable, including the Mon Valley.\" UPDATE: This story has been updated at 11:10 a.m. to include a response from the Allegheny County Health Department.

The fee derives from nearly 500 non-compliant inspections logged between July and September of 2022, according to an enforcement order issued today. The Clairton facility produces nearly 5 million tons of coal each year and is consequently one of Allegheny County's most potent polluters. The steel conglomerate and the health department have repeatedly fought over the details of regulation and enforcement provisions. In 2019, the parties reached a settlement agreement that, among other provisions, set up a Community Benefit Trust to channel funds into surrounding municipalities impacted by pollution from the plant. The settlement directs U.S. Steel to pay 90% of fines into the trust, and the remainder goes into the health department's Clean Air Fund. Since the 2019 settlement, fines logging in the six figures have continued as a cost of business for the industrial giant. In May, it was fined $307,800 for violations tallied last spring, and in November 2022, it was billed $458,225 for the previous quarter. U.S. Steel has contested the methods of enforcement and calculation underpinning these fines and formally appealed the November order. In response to today's enforcement, a company spokesperson again claimed the health department calculated the fines using methods at odds with the 2019 agreement. \"ACHD, again, breached its obligations under the June 2019 agreement and is reluctant to conduct inspections in a fair, consistent, reliable, and credible manner. U. S. Steel intends to invoke dispute resolution per the 2019 Settlement Agreement for the non-conforming observations and penalties,\" Media Relations Manager Amanda Malkowski tells Pittsburgh City Paper. \"U. S. Steel seeks to comply with all requirements under the Settlement Agreement and maintains a compliance rate of more than 99%.\" UPDATE: This story was updated at 5.00 p.m. on July 11 to include a statement from U.S. Steel.

Between the ridiculous barrage of ads and the potentially disappointing results, lots of people are leaving Twitter/X and cutting down on screentime. Time in the woods is undoubtedly better spent than time doomscrolling, and Pennsylvania has plenty of woods! However, the commonwealth is conspicuously lacking a National Park. That’s in spite of our neighbors in Ohio getting one in 2000 (the underrated Cuyahoga Valley National Park) and West Virginia getting one in 2020 (the beautiful New River Gorge). Pennsylvania’s nature can go toe-to-toe with Ohio’s and W.V.’s any day — some of our state parks could “make the big time” with only minimal improvements. In that spirit, here’s a case for at least one of five Western Pa. gems to be made into National Parks. If a remediated river valley in Ohio is good enough, surely the old-growth forest, scenic whitewater, expansive backpacking options, and gorgeous vistas right here in the Keystone State are, too! Raccoon Creek State Park Located just 40 minutes from Pittsburgh, Raccoon Creek contains 7,500 acres of trails and camping and is also home to the scenic Frankfort Mineral Springs. The park dates back to Great Depression-era public works projects and includes some Works Progress Administration-era buildings as well as a wildflower preserve in hilly wooded surroundings. As a bonus, swimming and boating on an artificial lake offer make this a nice place to swim and kayak. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams A trail along Raccoon Creek's backpacking loop in winter Cook Forest State Park Cook Forest feels like it was copy-pasted from the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. Covered in some of Pennsylvania’s oldest stands of hemlock and pine, these coniferous woods make for one of the most peaceful environments in Western Pa. Beyond the grand forest itself, access to biking and waterways, plus immediate proximity to state game lands, make this an outdoor recreation paradise. The century-old park even contains a National Historic District. Linn Run State Park/Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail The Laurel Highlands already contain some of Pennsylvania’s most pristine parklands, including Linn Run. Given the close proximity to Laurel Hill, Kooser, and Laurel Ridge state parks and the Roaring Run Natural area and the 70-mile Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail that runs north-south through the area, the Laurel Highlands would make an exceptional National Park. Allegheny National Forest The Pa. Wilds, as the area around Allegheny National Forest is called, is one of the least populous places east of the Mississippi River. While parts of the area were heavily logged during colonization, the forest is back, and among the many deciduous and coniferous woodlands are nestled ATV trails, campgrounds, and untouched wilderness areas. Perhaps the only thing working against the National Forest in terms of creating a new park is the presence of numerous oil and gas wells scattered throughout the area, something hardly unique to this region but still unfortunate. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams Cucumber Falls at Ohiopyle State Park Ohiopyle State Park Perhaps the most slam-dunk candidate for a Western Pa. National Park is Ohiopyle. Located in the heart of the southern Laurel Highlands close to other natural amenities and some of Frank Lloyd Wright’s finest works, Ohiopyle contains more than 20,000 acres of camping, whitewater, hiking and biking trails — including the Great Allegheny Passage trail to Washington, D.C. — and even has a cute historical town at its center, basically already recreating the infrastructure at the entrance of many National Parks. Even without federal status, this 53-year-old state park is one of Pennsylvania’s nicest places to escape the city and keep your face out of your phone. National Park status would be an awesome way to let the rest of the country know what we have here in beautiful Pennsylvania.

I’d always been the first, focused on the rhythm of my heart and the speed of my steps, until I discovered something magical: foraging. Foraging lies within our hunting-gathering DNA, connecting us to our ancestors and the Earth. Though most humans are eons removed from foraging for survival, there is value in collecting the bounties of nature, and discovering hidden treasures. Until I spent time with a certified forager, I had no idea there were so many varieties of wild berries, healing herbs, and magical mushrooms growing in our forests. And no, I’m not referring to psychadelic psilocybin, but rather, the free food that grows around us, packed with vitamins and nutrients you can’t find anywhere else in nature. click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Pheasant back mushroom, Allegheny County Southwest Pennsylvania sits in the humid continental climate, a paradise of wild fruit and fungal growth that thrives in balanced seasons and rainy spells. But even though our forests are filled with bounty, foraging, especially given its growing popularity, must be done responsibly. Staying safe while foraging One thing I never do is forage alone. I’m far too clumsy to be trusted not to break an ankle by stepping in a hole or tripping over a root. But there are worse things that can happen for sure, especially for those who don’t respect the rules of private property or tread on active state game lands. Nobody wants to be arrested or shot for the sake of foraging. Stick to public parks, private property where you have permission to forage (I take advantage of my brother’s three acres), or your own backyard. In the infancy of my foraging journey, I was tempted to pluck bright and delicious-looking mushrooms or berries from their branches, logs, and the forest floor. But unless you’re armed with some knowledge, it’s best to leave them lie. Simply put, you can eat anything once but may not enjoy (or survive) the outcome. click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Death Angel mushroom, Allegheny County It’s best to purchase at least one highly-rated guidebook, join a foraging group, and take a class or two. And be prepared for continuous learning along your journey. Resources for new foragers There are thousands of foraging guidebooks to choose from, so when you’re pursuing the bookshelves, key in on location, ease of use, and portability. Location is important because you aren’t going to get much use out of a guidebook specific to Southern France while exploring Southwestern Pa. (unless you’re going on a vacation, in which case, enjoy!). And you’ll want your book to fit in your fanny pack, backpack, or camelback so you can whip it out when you see a questionable berry or an interesting mushroom. The ah-ha moment when your guidebook identifies a new treasure is priceless. (After asking the online mushroom community for recommendations, I purchased a copy of Mushrooms of the Northeast and a copy of Wild Mushrooms of Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic.) click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Black staining polypore (and my leg), Allegheny County It’s worth following the local online foraging community as well. Dozens of localized groups gather on Reddit and Facebook, posting whatever they find fascinating or fun: photos of purple hands after harvesting wild grapes, exciting cooking videos, exceptionally phallic-looking mushrooms, and questionable discoveries. Some foragers in these groups can be extremely helpful, others … not so much. The online community should never be your only resource. After all, the members of most groups are at varying levels in their foraging journies. Between YouTube, mycology clubs, local producers, and community and state parks, there are a ton of classes available for foragers. 3 Rivers Outdoor Company hosts mushroom classes that include a lovely walk around Frick Park. I had a blast discovering some colorful turkey tails with the 3 Rivers crew, and I met a handful of like-minded budding foragers. The instructors even provided a mushroom identification sheet for their students, and after our walk in the woods, we were given an indoor spore kit to grow our own mushrooms at home. click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Cinnabar chanterelles, Allegheny County Until you’re confident in identifying wild edibles, never eat anything if you aren’t 100% sure won’t kill you, give you the worst stomach pain of your life, or make you unexpectedly trip your face off. Even if you’re quite sure your finds are edible, do yourself a solid and wash your greens and berries thoroughly. It’s also best to cook wild mushrooms before eating them to ensure that all bacteria and bugs are removed. Sharing the bounty A few weeks ago while walking through the woods, I stumbled upon a fallen log covered with chicken of the woods mushrooms. I could have taken them all, but that’s not the right thing to do. A forager who shares is a forager who cares, so I only took a third. That was enough to make “chicken” nuggets for my family and have plenty left over to freeze for later. click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Chicken of the woods mushrooms, Fayette County In the springtime, Southwestern Pa. boasts bounties of ramps — culinary favorites that are difficult to find, especially given their popularity. It may be tempting to rip these treasures out by the bulb, but you should only take half. And if you really want the bulb for its distinctively garlicky flavor, cut the bottom of the bulb with a sharp knife, leaving the roots intact, and place it back in the ground. The same goes for berries: the birds need to eat, too. While wild blackberries, wineberries, elderberries, and wild grapes grow plentifully around us, the animals also depend on them. Take your share, and leave the rest. Foraging at home If you are lucky enough to have a non-chemically treated yard, you may find some treasures growing in it. Spring onions grow like weeds in my yard; they’re easy to dry and last a very long time stored in an airtight jar. I haven’t purchased chives or dried onions in years. They’re great in soups like ramen or chili, and they make an excellent garnish if you want to get fancy with your plating. Plus, the bulbs can be roasted, and pair beautifully with venison and carrots. Edible mushrooms may grow in your yard, too. Wild puffballs are delicious and perfectly safe to eat when they’re pure white in the center. They make a wonderful faux pizza crust, they boil nicely into a mushroom soup, or you can even whip up some mushroom French toast! Polypores, shaggy manes, and meadow mushrooms are found growing in local backyards, as well. click to enlarge Stacy Rounds Wild violet french toast And don’t forget the edible flowers. Dandelions are highly nutritious. Dress up a summer salad with their bright yellow blooms, or tempura-fry those suckers for an unexpected flavor bomb. Dandelion greens are as nutritious as kale, and taste similar, too. Wild violets are also edible. Their petals are sweet and perfect for cookies or other baked goods, or you can make violet syrup that turns a fun blueish-purple color when you add a splash of lemon.

We’ll find out soon By Grace DeLallo click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost For decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have remained at the center of climate change messaging as the worst of the worst. In the psyche of your average media consumer, it’s the pollutant that has shown up the most. But tides are shifting — CO2 is potent and troublesome for people and the environment, but it’s not the only gas that should be heating up climate conversations. Last December, the Biden-Harris administration announced new methane regulations on “super polluters,” enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, that target some of the country’s biggest methane emitters. That includes prominent Pennsylvania polluters in the oil and gas industry. Katie Jones, the Ohio River Valley Coordinator with FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit working in Pennsylvania that leverages oil and gas development data to determine risks for communities and the planet — wants to see action beyond the federal level to tackle this issue. “It would be really great if [states] saw federal regulations as a floor, then put in stronger regulations than what’s required,” Jones says. Jones feels “hopeful” that the new federal regulations will help to accurately identify how much methane super-polluters are emitting, because, as she tells Pittsburgh City Paper, “it seems to be chronically underestimated.” click to enlarge Photo: Kenneth Painter/Pittsburgh Media Partnership Fracking site in Westmoreland County If the state and country are to reach their climate goals, accurate emission data is crucial, because methane has 28 times more warming potential than CO2. As the second-largest gas producing state in the country with a long history of extraction, Pennsylvania also simply has a different relationship with methane, the primary ingredient in natural gas. Rob Altenburg, the Energy Center Director at PennFuture — an organization helping to drive the transition to a clean energy economy in Pennsylvania — notes that “after the fracking is done, we already have an enormous problem with orphaned gas wells. We do not have an adequate bonding scheme that those wells will be closed after production now.” The Pa. Department of Environmental Protection has documented 25,000 wells, but this is only a fraction of what’s out there. Altenburg says 200,000 is a conservative estimate for the amount of wells that require bonding (or sealing off), while some estimates are upwards of 700,000. But it’s not just old wells that are causing the issues, it’s new development, too. One of Jones’ biggest concerns with methane is the amount of shale gas development that’s housed in Pennsylvania. “We have over 14,000 fracking wells that have been built in the state, and it’s only going to increase with the hydrogen hub that is proposed in the region,” she cautions. The hub would eventually make blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen produced from fracked gas and carbon capture and sequestration techniques. Pennsylvania is slated to partially house parts of two federally proposed hydrogen hub projects, with one on either side of the state. Regional and even international leaders see massive energy potential in the gas. Although the project already has billions of federal dollars behind it, there still remains uncertainty around the trajectory and feasibility of the project. Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher with the Ohio River Valley Institute, doesn’t foresee the project amounting to the image that’s being projected to people around these hubs. “I think, frankly, no one has any idea what the hydrogen hub will look like,” O’Leary says. “Almost certainly, the hydrogen hub will turn out to be considerably less than what people think it will be.” Altenburg also maintains some wariness around hydrogen, but acknowledges that it may have some value, though unknown. “Hydrogen will never be a huge player in electric generation in general. There may be some legitimate roles for it to play in decarbonization, but we’re not sure,” Altenburg says. “We want to be very clear on the problems we want to solve. Let's get a realistic assessment where this can be a factor and see where we can decarbonize in that.” Politicians are touting this project as revolutionizing clean energy, but how can something relying on greenhouse gasses create clean energy? Would methane no longer be a concern? “Even if there are regulations on those wells, it's still going to lead to a lot of methane emission,” Altenburg asserts. “We’re not going to have hydro piped into our homes. We already have leaks with gas, so that leaves few niche opportunities for hydrogen.” Jones also raises concern over state agencies having capacity to monitor such development and infrastructure. click to enlarge Photo: courtesy of Alan Freed/Pittsburgh Media Partnership Shell ethylene plant “[Pennsylvania] already has an issue with having less capacity than it needs to conduct all the inspections and enforce regulations, so, with these new programs, it causes concern for how these projects are going to operate on the ground,” Jones warns. When asked if the Ohio River Valley can take part in the renewable, green energy transition, even with the region's fossil fuel legacy, O’Leary sounds optimistic: “Not only can we, we should because one of the other characteristics at work here is that there is a widespread impression that the region's natural gas economy is vital, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.” O’Leary says the transition to renewable energy is possible — with proper organization. “The practice of transitions to renewable resources is something that needs to be planned. It does need to be done in an orderly fashion,” O’Leary tells City Paper. “But it starts with a commitment to doing it, and so far that isn’t something we’ve seen emerge in our area.” click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost The sluggish progress isn’t for lack of will, though. There are bigger forces at play. “The problem is, of course, that around the natural gas industry in particular, and gasoline and other substances, we have massive industries built up,” says O’Leary. “They’re the primary driving force for why the transition is not made or being made more aggressively.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Environment Latest in Environment Western Pa. deserves a National Park By Colin Williams Nov 11, 2024 Pittsburgh Disaster Solidarity hasn't forgotten Hurricane Helene's victims By Jordana Rosenfeld Nov 4, 2024 We have 19th-century Pittsburghers to thank for helping codify time as we know it By Rachel Wilkinson Oct 30, 2024 Pittsburghers can go scuba diving at Crusty's Quarry, which boasts some unique wildlife By Stacy Rounds Oct 11, 2024 More » More Environment All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

The study identifies the state’s 12 heaviest polluting facilities — dubbed the “Dirty Dozen” — noting six are located within Southwestern Pennsylvania. Most are coal and burning gas plants in Armstrong, Indiana, and Westmoreland counties, although U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson Coke Works in Braddock made the top five. Outside of the “Dirty Dozen, the study finds Southwestern Pennsylvania contributes nearly a full half of greenhouse gas emissions when factoring in all of the larger facilities tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Southwestern Pennsylvania accounted for 44% of greenhouse gas emissions reported by large polluters reporting their GHG emissions to the EPA in 2021 — by far, the largest share of any Pennsylvania region,” the report states. click to enlarge Screen Capture: PennEnvironment While the Pittsburgh area is flagged as a key offender within the state, the study also notes that Pennsylvania is itself a major culprit of emissions within the country. “In 2020, Pennsylvania was the fourth-largest greenhouse gas-emitting state in the nation. As a result, the commonwealth has a unique opportunity — and responsibility — to act on climate,” the authors note. PennEnvironment, a nonprofit research and policy center, outlines some recommendations alongside the results. These include accelerating the transition to renewable energy, strengthening enforcement of environmental laws and decarbonizing industries. Pittsburgh area lawmakers Abigail Salisbury and La’Tasha D. Mayes both decried the region’s environmental toll in statements provided in a press release accompanying the report. “We as a Commonwealth have the opportunity to become a leader in the fight for environmental justice and against climate change,” said Mayes (D-24). “As the fourth largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, we have an obligation to all Pennsylvanians to ensure access to clean air, to accelerate the shift to renewable energy and hold corporations accountable for the ways they jeopardize our health for profit.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Environment, Abigail Salisbury, La’Tasha D.

A continuance is not an approval or rejection, but a commitment to revisit the application after an unspecified amount of time. McKnight’s proposal has generated a lot of public opposition. Advocates say the firm failed to solicit and respond to community feedback. McKnight denied that their community engagement around this proposal was in any way inadequate. “I feel very strongly about the need to have you come back and work together with the community,” Commissioner Lashawn Burton-Faulk said, as she called for a continuation to allow for more and better communication between stakeholders. McKnight purchased the block of properties in late 2020 for $8.3 million. The block includes four separate structures, including the Kelly Strayhorn Theater and the four-story Penn Highland Building, which once housed a May Stern store. McKnight plans to leave KST and the Penn Highland building untouched and construct their building in the parcel’s southwestern quadrant. Izzy Rudolph, President of Development and Acquisitions for McKnight Realty Partners, spoke at the meeting of a desire to preserve these historic structures for the next generation and said McKnight met with “numerous community groups,” which he named as Village Collaborative of East Liberty, the parcel’s current retail tenants, and East Liberty Development, Inc. After the applicants presented their proposal, the commission heard from almost 30 members of the public who overwhelmingly spoke against McKnight’s plan. Most focused on the Kelly Strayhorn Theater’s value as a community asset and their concerns that, although McKnight says they are committed to having, in the words of project architect Ryan Indovina, “zero impact” on the theater’s operations, the development may have unintended negative consequences for KST. Several community members challenged the claim that Village Collaborative and ELDI are legitimate community representatives. Eric Vanistendael, former ELDI employee, said that while he holds no ill will towards the people of ELDI, “community groups [like ELDI] … do not represent the communities that they work in.” Vanistendael said ELDI actually represents certain power structures and fashionable ideas about urban development. \"Both [ELDI and Village Collaborative] are self-appointed and don't represent the community,\" said longtime Pittsburgh resident Mel Packer. KST staff and board members criticized McKnight’s communication with their organization throughout the process, calling it “misleading” and “inconsistent.” Caitlin Green, chair of the KST Board of Directors, also mentioned concerns about McKnight’s “lack of guarantees about operational impacts” on the theater and voiced her frustration that McKnight failed to reach out to KST after they sent McKnight a letter explaining their concerns. Other speakers criticized a history of inequitable top-down development in East Liberty, a tradition they say McKnight’s plan upholds. “We’re still standing in the shadow of the destruction of the Penn Plaza apartments,” said Adrian Jones, who urged the commission to consider the negative impacts of redlining, urban renewal, and gentrification in East Liberty. He said that too often in East Liberty’s history, profit concerns have trumped the needs of the neighborhood's Black and Brown residents. “East Liberty has been devastated by the erasure and the displacement of the people who actually made the community so attractive and so beautiful that you wanted to come here and develop it,” added Bekezela Mguni, a local artist and activist who is one of the founders of New Voices for Reproductive Justice. \"There are so few spaces in East Liberty that remain for Black people,\" said La'Tasha Mayes of New Voices for Reproductive Justice, who just announced her candidacy to fill Mayor Ed Gainey's former state House seat in District 24, which includes East Liberty. One local politician who has given his approval for the project is city councilor Ricky Burgess, who represents the city district and whose June 2021 letter of support was included in McKnight Realty Partner's application. \"I support this project and believe it will positively impact the East Liberty community, adding new neighbors to the area while keeping the Kelly Strayhorn and the historic May Stern Building intact,\" he wrote in 2021. “It doesn't seem to be about balconies, it seems to be more about participation and presence, and I think that's something that's within reach of this project,” said Commissioner Christine Mondor at the close of the meeting.

As snow, ice, and salt worsen conditions, these indispensable pieces of infrastructure can quickly become the cause of injuries or worse. There are two main issues with local sidewalks. The first is state law. For nearly 100 years, installation and maintenance of sidewalks in Pennsylvania has fallen to property owners. Local authorities can “establish” sidewalks and construct them, per 1933 Act 69 art. XXIV § 2401, which reads, “the expense of the construction of the sidewalk or curb shall be paid by the abutting property owners in proportion to their frontage.” There are exceptions, but the commonwealth’s default position since the 1930s has been sticking landowners with the bill without stipulating how said sidewalks should be built. The second issue? In many places, there simply are no sidewalks. Per Pa. Borough Code, a borough “may” lay out and/or construct sidewalks (or compel property owners to do so, as is often the case with new developments). But they don’t have to. This leaves numerous areas, including many in Pittsburgh, with sidewalks that just kind of end. The consequences of all of this are real. In Pittsburgh, it’s more than an aesthetic nightmare, especially in winter — neighborhoods of rowhouses may see a sidewalk go from new concrete to old brick to patchy asphalt (or even dirt) and back again within a block. In icy conditions, unshoveled and unsalted brick sidewalks can become slippy and trippy. The city technically requires snow removal per City Code 419.03, but enforcement is infrequent at best, and not everyone has the mobility and strength needed to dig themselves out after snowfall. Well-intentioned initiatives like Pittsburgh’s Snow Angels program don’t always meet the need for snow removal, with a disproportionate number of volunteers in better-off neighborhoods. Also, you can be sued if someone does fall in front of your house (unlike in neighboring Ohio, apparently). Essentially, where you live and who your neighbors are could mean the difference between a carefree walk with your dog and a nasty injury or lawsuit. But what about area residents with no sidewalks at all? In suburbs with limited streetlights, the paucity of places for pedestrians can be deadly. A McCandless resident and her dog were both struck and killed at an intersection with no sidewalks when an SUV crashed into them during a nighttime walk in mid-December. Both residents and local leadership flagged the lack of sidewalks as a factor. Reckless and distracted driving are part of the equation. City planners can design around bad drivers to some extent with bollards, leading intervals, and other interventions (as Pittsburgh leaders did following a deadly crash in Oakland). But in areas with no sidewalks, including high-speed corridors such as McKnight Rd., a car losing control in the snow can have disastrous consequences for people and buildings. Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania more broadly, need sidewalk reform. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Maintenance can sometimes force people off the sidewalks altogether and onto slippery streets. The commonwealth already acknowledges that “[u]nimpeded access to sidewalks is essential for people with mobility impairments to go to work, access government buildings, shop, and generally to travel freely through their communities.” Per the ADA, curb ramps are a requirement, and state law also prohibits driving on sidewalks (many yinzers ignore this, but Philly is breaking its citizens of this habit). So why are individual property owners still saddled with paying for and maintaining a public good? When a developer has to jackhammer an existing sidewalk for utility lines, forcing them to repave it makes sense. The same should not apply to a longtime homeowner in a 1,000-square-foot rowhouse. Without more enforcement, there’s also no incentive to change this in front of abandoned homes or empty lots. It all feels especially unfair when you see PennDOT repairing sidewalks along its thoroughfares and utility companies replacing sidewalks in your neighborhood after putting in new water or gas lines. Studies show sidewalks decrease the risk of pedestrian deaths. There’s a compelling argument for mandating them in areas with a certain population density. Greater effort and statewide reform would mean safer conditions for everyone. This paired with measures including bollards, leading intervals, bulbouts, and traffic calming would also incentivize more Pittsburghers to walk, roll, and bike. Imagine a snowy day with upgraded sidewalks. The blade of your shovel glides smoothly over the expansion joints — it’s so easy to keep pushing down your neighbor’s walk, and you can even don a unicorn outfit to make it more fun — all the way to the curb cut. Where the sidewalk once ended at an empty lot, there’s now fresh concrete awaiting a new house. You wave to your non-unicorn neighbors as they walk back from the grocery store or down to the bus stop. Why drive when everything is smooth and salted? Proper planning prevents poor pavement performance. We need better sidewalks! Changes to state law and local zoning requirements could be a start. While we’re at it, it’s worth prioritizing pedestrians and wheelchair users as we rethink our car-centric country. Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Pa.

There, I said it, on behalf of both cyclists and aggressive truck drivers. Because of the latter, they do little for the former. Trucks can easily squash flexible barriers, making it easy for delivery drivers and aggressive shortcutters to overtake bike lanes with several tons of steel. While they’re a step up from mere lines and paint, these flimsy bits of plastic are a Band-Aid instead of surgery for the problem of making roads, sidewalks, and busy crossings safer for all users. There is a better way: the Way of the Bollard. So what is a bollard? Per Wikipedia, it is a “sturdy, short vertical post.” While often found where you can moor boats, they’ve become essential traffic-control tools when installed where you don’t want cars. They can be decorated, illuminated, removable, retractable. Often, they’re supported by a wide underground base that allows them to withstand many thousands of pounds of force. The key difference between bollards and flex posts? I’m glad you asked: Try getting into my bike lane now! I’m sure at least one person reading this is going to get mad or accuse me of wishing drivers harm. On the contrary — even in the above scenario, a driver is likely to be relatively safe thanks to advancements in car safety. But a bollard ensures that even when a driver is unsafe, their vehicle cannot physically enter spaces designed for people and their bikes, skates, wheelchairs, scooters, and strollers. We have plenty of bollards in Pittsburgh. Just downtown, you’ll find these silent sentinels guarding the perimeter of Market Square. Similar physical barriers protect the William S. Moorhead Federal Building and the entrance to Point State Park. (The Penn Ave. bike lane, though not protected by bollards, has nonetheless benefitted from the addition of concrete wheel stops between 11th and Stanwix). You’ll find still more along Fifth and Forbes in Oakland and elsewhere in town. Flexposts may say “no thank you,” but bollards say “absolutely not.” Bollards are also a proactive “yes,” clearly signaling that a space is for any humans not wrapped in 3,000 pounds of metal and plastic. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams FlexPosts are often sheared off or squashed like these examples in Morningside and Lawrenceville. It’s honestly sad that we need to make these distinctions at all, but distracted and aggressive driving are endemic in Pittsburgh, and many locals drive cars and trucks far bigger than what they need for work or home. Moreover, shallow turns, rolling stops, and cutting off cyclists are common here. This, plus a lack of clarity about loading zones, means even “protected” bike lanes face the occasional intrusion of a moving van or delivery truck when people get lazy. The solution? Make drivers adapt. This is essentially the thesis of every Transit Talk I’ve written: making a city less convenient for fast drivers makes it safer for everyone else. More novel modes of transit such as water taxis and more intensive conversions such as roundabouts would lessen and calm traffic, respectively, but bollards are a cheap way to defend what you have. Imagine never having cars intrude on your favorite bike lane or pedestrian plaza. Bollards could turn painted neckdowns (like the one recently completed on Woods Run Ave.) into permanent pedestrian zones or wide sidewalks into car-proof outdoor dining spaces. Similar to the Cultural District’s fanciful bike racks, bollards could be rolled out in the shape of baseball bats, blast furnaces, test tubes, or penguins depending on their location. Retractable bollards could also be used to turn some narrower streets into bus-only shortcuts or shopping plazas closed to all non-emergency vehicles. Why not use them to limit Penn Ave. to pedestrians, rollers, and cyclists full time? At some point, you have to make driving inconvenient or impossible in parts of a city. Only then can a true multi-use future emerge. Bollards are among the most cost-effective ways to do this in the existing built environment, even if that means the occasional fender-bender or oil leak from an impatient driver. Meanwhile, there may be other traffic calming solutions hidden just beneath the surface of Pittsburgh’s roads… Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Bollards, Penn Ave. bike lane, William S.

Sadly, we no longer act like it — the main watercraft you're likely to see on our Three Rivers are coal barges, with the remaining traffic coming from private power boats, Cruisin' Tiki huts, and the Gateway Clipper fleet. It doesn't have to be like this. Ferries have a long history in the region. The Gateway Clipper already does substantial business carrying tourists from Station Square to Acrisure Stadium. Meanwhile, development in the Strip District and Sharpsburg has converted what was industrial waterfront into a public amenity. The time is ripe to connect the City of Bridges' revitalized waterfront via the rivers themselves using public water taxis. We've experimented with water taxis before. Pittsburgh had federal grant funding earmarked for a pilot program as recently as 2012. There have been private services over the years, but these have proven challenging to scale. This is why local government should seriously consider stepping in — without the muscle and money of a public entity, private water taxis could again struggle to make sustainable profits or scale up quickly enough to get the public on board. Some of the infrastructure is already there. Sharpsburg, Millvale, the Strip, the North Shore, Point State Park, Station Square, and the South Side already have marinas and mooring points where a small water taxi could park. Lawrenceville and Hazelwood Green have old barge docks that could be converted without much difficulty, and Homestead would be easy to reach, as well. From there, a minimum of two ferries could sail in a loop from Sharpsburg's breweries to South Side's nightlife and back again from 7 a.m. to midnight, providing a fun way to commute, experience the city, and/or travel safely while enjoying an evening out in Pittsburgh. A potential stop at Hazelwood Green would give college students an Instagrammable way to venture outside of Oakland. A water taxi could also service the West End and the proposed Esplanade development without having to pass through a lock. All told, the two water taxis could likely complete a loop of the city's Three Rivers in an hour or so, thereby ensuring 30-minute intervals between departures (something not even all city bus lines do). click to enlarge CP Photo: Jake Mysliwczyk The Gateway Clipper sails down the Monongahela River There are several major upsides to turning the rivers into a regular part of Pittsburgh's transit system. The potential environmental benefits are one. Boats are more efficient than buses (and far more efficient than cars carrying solo commuters). If used at a similar rate to Pittsburgh's T, water taxis would offset some carbon output while also complementing and connecting existing service lines. Bicycle commuters using our riverfront trails would have a built-in multimodal service that avoids car traffic. Water-taxi technology itself is also getting greener, with Helsinki rolling out solar-powered autonomous ferries just last year. Also, using more boats would put more Pittsburghers directly on the water, giving them a chance to appreciate the city from a new angle. If someone is willing to take a water taxi from South Oakland to Mario's, they might also be more likely to rent a kayak or participate in a riverbank cleanup. Another big upside — fun. A water taxi along the Allegheny would be second only to the 91 bus in terms of how many breweries there would be along its length. Partiers could start their day at Dancing Gnome, steam down to catch a Riverhounds game, go dancing at Enclave and head back around the Point without ever getting into a car. I know I'd like my commute more if it involved riding my bike to a dock and boating out into the Allegheny. While everyone else sits in traffic and honks in vain at drivers playing Candy Crush at the green light, I'd be on board a solar-powered ferry watching the sun glint on the murky waters of the Mon. It may sound unrealistic, but Helsinki, Paris, and even Oklahoma City already have water taxis — if a city with a fake river can have one, why not us? Besides, just think how awesome our Pittsburgh City Paper barge watch content would be if we were sharing the rivers with the city's gentle giants. Give me the water taxi! Connect it to the Railroad St. T while you're at it. Then we can turn our attention to the Pittsburgh gondola.

The most obvious place to extend Pittsburgh's T is already named accordingly. Railroad St. in the Strip District follows a neglected line of the Allegheny Valley Railroad parallel to the lively Smallman St. corridor. Along its one side, there's a generous space that could accommodate parallel trolley tracks. I've been looking at these tracks for years and yearning for them to become the starting point of Pittsburgh's next great trolley era. The plan makes almost too much sense — with the Strip District growing, Lawrenceville in its prime, and existing trolley infrastructure in place near Penn Station, what I'll call the \"Black Line\" would be well-positioned to become the second-most used public transit corridor after the MLK Jr. East Busway. The color is just a suggestion based on black's role in our civic and sports identity, and it isn't currently used by PRT, unlike purple, green, orange, red, blue, and silver. (A Gold Line could follow later, or the South Busway, currently coded yellow on maps, could be renamed in this scenario.) Trolleys have a long history in our city. They were the main mode of transit for many Pittsburghers until the 1970s, and they're still indispensable for South Hills commuters. However, the T as it currently exists offers little for tourists who want venture beyond Downtown, Station Square, and the North Shore. A line connecting to the Strip District and Lawrenceville would change that. Both neighborhoods have abundant food, drink, lodging, and landmarks. They also both suffer from an overabundance of traffic along narrow, two-lane streets. The Black Line would take pressure off of Butler St. and Penn Ave. parking and give partiers an easier way to get from Over Eden to Tequila Cowboy or from the Buccos to bedtime. An easy transfer in Station Square or Downtown would also give South Hills residents a car-free way to get farther into town — for commuters used to sitting in traffic along Banksville Rd. or Sawmill Run Blvd., zipping through Dormont and Beechview en route to a night at the Benedum would save time, money, and stress. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost One potential route for a trolley running from the Penn Ave. T station to Lawrenceville via the Strip District. Transit, ultimately, is often about equity. A way to further infuse this project with opportunities for locals would be to connect a station near 20th St. to a pedestrian walkway, railroad flyover, and public steps with access to the criminally underused Frank Curto Park, giving some Hill District residents — and visitors curious about the August Wilson House — an easy, if steep, way to get to Pittsburgh's most popular nightlife areas. This would benefit tourists and locals in equal measure and restore a small link between neighborhoods severed from one another by the city's highways. Meanwhile, farther down the line, a spur could connect tourists with the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium. This would benefit Highland Park and Morningside Residents, visiting families, and the long-buried Heth's Run stream by taking pressure off of the zoo's massive parking lots. Indeed, a stream daylighting project could even be built into such an extension for an additional couple million bucks. Longer-term, PRT would also have the option to reevaluate the structure of T lines for maximum efficiency. A popular line in Lawrenceville, paired with dormant plans for an extension through Manchester, could be a massive step toward activating the Esplanade development or resurrecting the lost Beaver Ave. business corridor under Pa. 65, eventually paving the way for a commuter line along the Ohio Valley. To my mind, the only drawbacks to this plan are fairly obvious. Cost is the first one. Light rail is far more expensive than busways, though it can be more efficient and environmentally friendly. This would likely be an extremely expensive undertaking for a transit agency struggling to recover from COVID and the end of accompanying stimulus funds. The other issue is that the Allegheny Valley Railroad has been slow to warm to green infrastructure projects. However, local authorities have successfully worked with the railroad on similar projects such as the Brilliant Line, and anyway, most of the track along Railroad St. is barely used. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams The Allegheny Valley Railroad's tracks along Railroad St. Picture it: you walk down from your room at the Tryp Hotel and around the corner to the 40th St. station. A Black Line train, perhaps wrapped in a Clemente or Stargell decal, picks you up and whisks you along what used to be an industrial corridor to lunch at Cinderlands. Then, after an exciting trip over the new Liberty Ave. flyover, your Black Line trolley carries you through the city's bustling subway to a packed Acrisure Stadium. Whatever your night holds, the T is there to take you back safe and sound, and all you've spent on transit that day is $7 for a PRT day pass. I'm a simple person, and I'm asking for a simple thing: give me more trolleys! If you build it, I will ride.

They’d apparently rather pay $.50 less for eggs than acknowledge climate change. Fun! Clearly, the country’s exurbanite F-150 drivers aren’t willing to ditch their bad habits. Meanwhile, the rest of us are stuck wondering how to tidy our respective corners and hopefully lay the foundations for a better future under less-than-ideal circumstances. As the Big Boy Truck crowd continues their automobile arms race and Amazon vans clog our roadways, Pittsburghers who care about lowering emissions are left with a seemingly Sisyphean task. However, there’s an obvious solution to some of our woes hiding in plain sight: electric-assist cargo bikes. I’ve already extolled the virtues of e-bikes in this column. As local TikToker Saxboybilly18 puts it, an e-bike “is the hack” for navigating Pittsburgh without a car. But, as it turns out, it may also be the hack for last-mile deliveries, short-distance transit, and car-free grocery shopping. The range of e-bike offerings has exploded in recent years, such that Downtown Pittsburgh is now home to Fierro eBikes, a store dedicated solely to them. Concurrently, cargo bikes with pedal assist — and often with built-in seatbelts for young passengers — have risen in popularity and fallen in price. Some newer models retail for under $2,000, making them a more attractive alternative to cars for families considering the switch. When paired with restrictions on vehicle size and weight in dense urban corridors, these hardworking e-bikes can replace a significant portion of delivery vehicles in a given area. It’s annoying to always have to point to Europe to see examples of functional transit, but, sure enough, cities such as London have experimented with the widespread introduction of cargo bikes and restrictions on car traffic. The city’s pedal-powered fleets have cut down on congestion and delivery time in some cases. U.S. companies including UPS and Jeff Bezos’ juggernaut have also gotten on board. But there are also plenty of domestic examples worth mentioning. New York is teeming with couriers, gig workers, and delivery people riding e-bikes. This year, the city updated its laws specifically to make cargo e-bikes safer to use. Elsewhere, metro Boston has seen the introduction of bicycle delivery of Christmas trees in time for the holidays. Talk about going green! For Pittsburgh, where narrow streets combine with abysmal driving and parked delivery vans to create the optimal conditions for road rage, introducing cargo bikes would face challenges. But they have some marked advantages over delivery vans when it comes to handling packages, takeout food and drink, and time-sensitive documents. For starters, you can park them on the sidewalk on arrival — no having to cross the double yellow line to go around an inconvenient FedEx truck! Cargo e-bikes can also make use of trails and dedicated bike lanes, thus bypassing car traffic and the potential for accidents altogether. Purely in terms of logistics, I doubt drivers would notice a difference in conditions with a few more cargo bikes sharing local roadways. Bikes also often have an easier time navigating Pittsburgh’s seemingly endless street repairs. Moreover, e-bikes are a boon to public health. Using cargo e-bikes would keep DoorDashers and Amazon drivers active and engaged instead of sitting in a hot van. Winter weather and rain can be a pain for overworked delivery people gigging for tech giants, but even offsetting a percentage of deliveries with bikes in nicer weather would save companies money, cut back on diesel fumes, and improve gig workers’ health. Imagine never having to weave around parked Amazon vans on your way down Butler St. on a Saturday. Instead, couriers pull up to your door with a cheerful jingle of their bell! Then, they pedal off, using a dedicated lane to bypass the suburban brunch crowd who can’t parallel park despite 30 years on the road, and, as you set your package inside, you wheel out your own e-bike, child buckled in safely, for an emissions-free ride to the park. We may live in a stupid time, but we also have a remarkable number of solutions staring us in the face. Why stick your head in the sand when you could get your butt in the saddle? After all, making something you like cool can be more effective than making something you dislike illegal… Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Cargo e-bikes, E-bikes, Amazon, UPS, DoorDash Related Content Transit Talk: Please pay for my e-bike By Colin Williams Sep 24, 2024 Dead Developments: 10 promising Pittsburgh building projects that never happened By Michael Machosky May 22, 2023 Local groups demand UPMC \"pay what they owe\" to city tax coffers By Jordana Rosenfeld Aug 19, 2022 Watch the first trailer for Billy Porter's Pittsburgh-shot film Anything's Possible By Amanda Waltz Jun 3, 2022 Latest in Infrastructure Transit Talk: All aboard the midibus By Colin Williams Feb 18, 2025 Inclusionary zoning sparks passionate debate and questions about math By David S.

If you’ve ever had to memorize where an Isaly’s used to be in order to give directions, you know how this works. Imagine that, except in reverse: “Things That Aren’t Coming Here, Ever.” Someday, we can all give out directions like, “Oh, you know, just hang a left at the GIANT EMPTY VOID where the Wholey’s Fish Market used to be.” In honor of these projects that got our hopes up — or filled us with ire — but never delivered (at least yet), here’s a completely subjective list of the most significant dead developments in Pittsburgh from the last several years. To make it seem slightly scientific, each is given a score from 1 to 10. 1 is DEAD-DEAD, like super dead — never going to happen. 10 is UNDEAD, like this project could surprise us and rise from the grave. It’s been known to happen around here. Batman goes green Sometimes, even the best Batman (not up for debate) takes the train to Flop Town. In 2021, Michael Keaton pitched a collaboration with Nexii Building Solutions, promising to manufacture a lower-carbon, sustainable concrete alternative called Nexiite here in Pittsburgh. Green building, 300 manufacturing jobs, decarbonizing the concrete business — sounds great! Sign us up! However, it might have been just one of those things where the elevator pitch sounded great — like, “Yeah, let’s totally greenlight that Succession/Ted Lasso crossover fanfic!”— and the script revealed how unworkable it really was. Keaton has more important things on his mind, anyway. He is Batman, after all. Deadscore: 1 A fishy farm In 2019, Minnesota entrepreneur Glenn Ford pitched an idea for a jumbo-sized fresh-seafood aquaponics farm alongside the Mon in Duquesne. He delivered digital renderings, making the project seem official. There was also the promise that it would provide hundreds of jobs. Plus, who could resist the lure of Monongahela Sea Bass becoming the next culinary sensation? Alas, that dream is one that got away; the project never went forward. A recent article from Columbia Insight reported that the farm will very likely never see the light of day due to Ford's involvement with a shady Oregon-based businessman named Stephen D. King. While details are scant, Ford confirmed that he did work with King on the Duquesne project, adding, \"My recommendation to anyone doing business with Stephen [King] is run.\" Deadscore: 1 Zoomed out During those queasy early days of the pandemic, Zoom — one of the few companies whose value skyrocketed — decided to open a major engineering office in Pittsburgh. Except, that very company also specializes in making offices irrelevant. And soon, they decided that they could do without one in Pittsburgh, too. Imagine that. In a similar fashion, DoorDash dined and dashed after grabbing some good press here in 2021, never delivering the actual office, or its promised 50 jobs. Deadscore: 2 click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Brandon Haw Architecture Wholey empty The smiling Wholey fish always gazed down benevolently on our hapless foibles without judgment, and we miss it terribly. But no, nobody really needed a monstrous, windowless bomb shelter with three-foot-thick concrete walls, originally built to keep seafood cold. Especially one that was going to be vacant forever, barring some sort of Fallout/The Last of Us-type scenario. So, the plan to build an actual skyscraper at 1520 Smallman St. in the Strip District is an upgrade. Only now, it doesn’t matter, because no one wants skyscrapers anymore, because no one wants to work in offices anymore. Unless they pivot to housing, this is going to sit empty for a long, long time. Deadscore: 3 Jazzed up for nothing The James Street Tavern site in Deutschtown is a repeat offender when it comes to getting our hopes up. Noise complaints from nebby neighbors closed this legendary, 125-year-old jazz club back in 2017, and it has sat dormant ever since. (Because jazz hasn’t really drawn a rowdy and disorderly crowd since, I don’t know, the 1930s, this never made any sense.) Every few years, someone floats a plan to re-open the beautiful, three-story, red-brick building, but the last round of stories was in 2021, and since then it’s just been more of the usual — endless, cursed silence. Deadscore: 4 click to enlarge Image: Courtesy of Walnut Capital Architectural drawing of Oakland Crossings Crossed off the list Odds are, there will be more stories written about this project than actual bricks rising from the earth of South Oakland. Oakland Crossings envisions a massive residential project with hundreds of units in the area around the Boulevard of the Allies, with a number of mixed-use buildings, green spaces, and even a neighborhood grocery store — a priority in the neighborhood for decades. Right now, the Boulevard of the Allies is an auto-centric menace blasting through the neighborhood, unpleasant to cross on foot. A pedestrian bridge across the street is part of the plan, as is a parking garage, along with substantial streetscape improvements. So, what’s the catch? Well, there are a lot of neighbors. That is to say, it’s not always greedy developers who tank things; sometimes it’s just your friends and nebby/NIMBY neighbors who will fight change for any reason, that reason usually being about protecting their property values. Prediction: someone will nominate the closed Quality Inn/Panera Bread to some heretofore undiscovered status eligible for historic preservation, and this will never end.

In recent years, the Garden has been gutted and rebuilt entirely, its white terra-cotta facade now gleaming proudly in the starlight. It’s ready for a nice restaurant or brewpub.

That’s where we are with the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project, which has been discussed as far back as 2014, perhaps earlier. Mass transit is actually great, and buses are super-underrated ways of moving people en masse. Yet, for the $291 million in expected costs, eons of public debate, and endless newsprint (and pixels) expended, it’s still an incredibly pedestrian and unambitious transit dream. If it all goes well, we may someday end up with a functioning BRT system objectively worse than a random mid-tier Japanese or Dutch suburb. Supposedly, construction on the project could start this fall. But by the time this is finished, the rest of the world will have probably moved on to aerial gondolas/trams, or dozens of tiny drones that whisk us away to our destination.

And yet, it’s kind of floundering right now. Not long ago, the Florida-based company Trulieve was promoting plans to hire 800 employees in the long-struggling city of McKeesport. This wasn’t completely vaporware, as Trulieve does have some current operations in McKeesport. But as recently as December they were laying off McKeesport employees — even after rolling out Khalifa Kush, a partnership with Pittsburgh rapper emeritus Wiz Khalifa.

A Ferris wheel — named after its inventor, North Sider George Ferris — is intended to be one of the anchor attractions for the Esplande — a multifaceted mixed-use plan that includes 1.7 million square feet of glass high-rise housing, hotels, offices, restaurants, a splash park, a pavilion, and a marina on the North Shore. Fancy! Alas, the original plan, which began circulating in 2018, included a two-acre swimming pool (lagoon!) that turned into an ice rink in winter, but that's been dropped. Maybe it's for the best since you don’t want to hear how Yinzers say the word “lagoon.” That said, Pittsburgh is slowly learning to embrace its rivers after treating them as industrial sewers for over 100 years, and there’s a better-than-even chance this project comes to fruition. Piatt Companies (formerly Millcraft Investments) is an experienced local developer. Plus, this stretch of land, past the Carnegie Science Center, has been vacant or industrial forever, and the neighborhood of Chateau has about three actual residents, so there's really nobody nearby to complain. We may never get a lagoon, but the dream is alive for the rest of it.

By Ryan Deto click to enlarge Image: courtesy of Millcraft Renderings of lagoon proposal from 2018, which were not included in the most recent Millcraft development plans for Pittsburgh's Chateau neighborhood Last week, Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority approved a large development in the Chateau section of the city’s North Side that would transform six acres of industrial property into a mixed-use Esplanade that calls for a mix of market-rate and affordable housing, commercial space, a marina, and even a Ferris wheel. This big development is being managed by Millcraft and it have garnered a lot of attention. This has actually been the case for years, when it arguably made a bigger splash, as the development firm dropped plans for the Esplanade project to include a large, blue lagoon complete with a beach in the summer, and ice skating with thermal baths in the winter. THIS IS INCREDIBLE! Check out what is coming to #Pittsburgh's North Side. A blue lagoon with a beach in the summer & ice skating with thermal baths in the winter. Not to mention a giant Ferris wheel you can ride in all year long! MORE PHOTOS AND DETAILS: https://t.co/JxjN9BSrxA pic.twitter.com/Meg7EDQGvn— KDKA (@KDKA) September 14, 2018 However, the plans recently approved by the URA didn’t have any mention of a lagoon. And while the rendered drawings of what is likely to come to Chateau do look transformational for the North Side, the drawings showed no “breathtaking blue lagoon,” as it had been described by local media in the past. So what happened to the lagoon? Millcraft spokesperson Molly Onufer explained in a statement the plans changed to “redesign the area into an inclusive pavilion and green space to connect the site to the riverfront.” She wrote that this decision largely had to do with land and size requirements of the development, and some issues in getting permission from a private railroad, which still retains some rights to that section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. “The railroad retains some rights to the Three Rivers Heritage Trail that traverses our property and we were unable to get permission to relocate the land rights or to build anything permanent there,” wrote Onufer. “The rest of space couldn’t accommodate the minimum size requirement for the Crystal Lagoon, so our improved plan includes a centerpiece destination that will be the heart of the Esplanade project.” click to enlarge Image: courtesy of Millcraft Rendering of Millcraft's pavilion green space plan as part of its proposed Esplanade development for Chateau. The proposal still includes plans for a Ferris wheel Private railroad companies retain many land-use and right-of-way rights along many corridors in Allegheny County, especially along the rivers. The city owns the Three Rivers Heritage trail and the section that runs north through Chateau. However, a map from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation indicates that section of trail does include a railroad right of way. Onufer says that CSX was the railroad that operated along the trail before the tracks became the part of a Rails to Trails program. Getting permission from private rail companies for development isn’t always easy. A proposed trail from Millvale to Apsinwall has hit delays because of negotiations between the municipalities and the railroad. Railroads can be wary of liability issues for development near or along their right of ways. click to enlarge Image: courtesy of Millcraft Rendering of Millcraft's pavilion green space plan as part of its proposed Esplanade development for Chateau It's also not uncommon for large developments to alter their plans, even in the late stages. And Pittsburgh, like many cities, is full of ambitious proposals that fail to materialize. Throughout the last several decades, many large projects that have failed to be completed include: SkyBus transit system, MagLev high-speed rail, a stadium built on a massive bridge over the rivers, and more recently, hyperloop. But even without the lagoon, Millcraft says the Esplanade will still be offering a large and welcoming public space called “The Pavilion,” which will include operable windows and a roof structure that will allow of convertible indoor and outdoor space. The lagoon plan is out, but Onufer notes that the updated plan should have more amenities than previously proposed, including a “four-season rooftop pool.” She says that will include a climbing wall, public art, a food emporium for merchants, a brew-pub, an indoor/outdoor public park, a food and beverage event venue, sustainable features like solar panels on the roof and façade. “It will serve as a bridge between the family-oriented side of the site, the retail, the riverfront, and the enhanced public trail with even more amenities than our previous plan,” wrote Onufer. “The new plan includes something for everyone for all times of the year (and all kinds of Pittsburgh weather).” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags News, Housing, Lagoon, Millcraft, Pittsburgh, North Side, Chateau, railroad, mixed-use development, Esplanade, The Pavilion Related Content Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

Part of that is due to aggressive — and, in some cases, illegal — maneuvers such as the Pittsburgh left and widespread local treatment of red lights as “orange.” But part of the city’s touch-and-go driving is due to our severe topography and outdated infrastructure, as seen in our many confusing intersections that require oddly-timed red lights, quick merges that throw off unfamiliar motorists, and wide crossings that have contributed to a rise in pedestrian fatalities. As European metropolises figured out some time ago, it doesn’t have to be like this. Enter the roundabout (or traffic circle). The Federal Highway Administration says roundabouts can be “an effective option for managing speed and transitioning traffic from high-speed to low-speed environments.” The neckdowns required to channel traffic into the roundabout also offer pedestrians islands of refuge. Instead of a sea of asphalt and tangles of traffic lights, roundabouts can additionally serve as bicycle-friendly points of connection or venues for public art. Moreover, roundabouts can turn a gnarly five- or six-way intersection that backs up at rush hour into a constantly moving junction that keeps traffic flowing at slower speeds. Pittsburgh is littered with complicated intersections that hold drivers and cyclists at red lights for long periods of time. One such intersection, the Herron-Paulowna-Bigelow intersection in Polish Hill, recently lost both a pedestrian tunnel and a nearby overhead bridge, forcing walkers and rollers across four lanes of pothole-pocked roadway notorious for lead-footed drivers. Timing five different green lights plus turn lanes requires a complicated dance that can result in drivers waiting more than 15 minutes for a green light. A roundabout here would slow down Bigelow speeders while lowering wait time for drivers headed uphill or down. There are numerous other intersections like this. The West End Bridge could end in several mini-roundabouts instead of a hard-to-navigate series of lights. The critical meeting of Penn and Fifth Aves. would flow much more smoothly with a roundabout. Adding one would also markedly improve the ridiculous Saw Mill Run-Glenbury-Ivy Glen-Hill mishmash in Overbrook. All of these intersections back up quickly and are overtly hostile to non-car traffic. I’m in no way advocating for the return of the abominations that were the Allegheny and Penn Circles. Both were designed not to make traffic slower and safer but to speed suburbanites around poorly conceived urban renewal initiatives. But as the city considers more road diets, traffic-calming measures, and multimodal infrastructure, roundabouts should absolutely factor in. Consider the car-centric wasteland that is the Bloomfield Bridge intersection, where Main St., Liberty Ave., Howley St., and several bike lanes converge at the “Welcome to Little Italy” sign (which has needed several restorations after vehicle collisions in just the past decade). Rather than hold up drivers, walkers, cyclists, and rollers at a series of weirdly-timed lights, and force pedestrians across eight lanes of impatient Bloomfield traffic, a roundabout would provide spots of refuge that could be planted with shade-giving trees for a heat-island offsetting effect. It would also slow cars down as they leave the bridge and enter the narrow residential streets of Bloomfield. The Little Italy sign could even take a place of pride in the central island. A carefully-planned roundabout could likely fit within the intersection’s existing footprint and make it far safer for area residents to walk to get groceries or head across Liberty for Italian ice or beer. It would likewise improve the streetscape ahead of the long-delayed ShurSave development. Pittsburgh wasn’t built as a car city, and intersections like the Bloomfield Bridge are a relic of an age when retrofitting for cars, everything else be damned, was the going wisdom. But we’ve evolved. Vision Zero, speed humps, and public art are in; six-way intersections with faded crosswalks are out. To bring Pittsburgh fully into a future where cars share the road rather than dominating it, it’s time to untangle the Gordian knots that are our scariest intersections and replace them with roundabouts. We need infrastructure that isn’t built solely for motorists, and roundabouts are an indispensable tool for making our streets safer for everyone. Perhaps, one day, maybe sooner than I dared hope, there will even be parts of the city that aren’t for motorists at all… Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Infrastructure, Pittsburgh, Infrastructure Related Content Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein The North Side building where Penn Hills resident Peter Katsafanas operated his family’s coffee business is a landmark building in the Allegheny Second Ward Industrial Historic District. In 2024, the historic district was nominated for listing in the National Register of Historic Places as part of a National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 compliance project. Five drunk men pulled Joseph Cawthon from his car at a Garfield intersection one Sunday afternoon in 1958. Cawthon was Black and his attackers were white. The men beat Cawthon while his wife, Christine, watched. In 2010, the Municipality of Penn Hills demolished the former Cawthon home in Lincoln Park. Penn Hills planners wrote that the 83-year-old house, which, by then, had been abandoned, had no history — a nebulous designation. Penn Hills used federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to demolish the former Cawthon home. It was one of hundreds of buildings razed over the past 50 years in the municipality’s Townwide Demolition Program. The CDBG funds have strings attached to them: Penn Hills is required to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act before spending the money. By ignoring the former Cawthon home’s history and others, Penn Hills has contributed to the root shock — the disintegration of residents’ emotional ecosystem — described in last month’s story. That trauma is a major factor in what Black Lincoln Park residents believe is a long pattern of environmental racism in Penn Hills. Historic preservation isn’t just about protecting old buildings. “The curious thing about the [Section] 106 process is that it's not supposed to prevent the destruction of historic resources,” says Jeremy Wells, a former University of Maryland historic preservation professor and the author of several books on historic preservation. “The main intent of [Section] 106 is to get people from the public or groups representing the public to the table to have a conversation with government about what's going to happen to this place and how to mitigate any of those changes.” In other words, the Section 106 compliance process mandates community involvement. People in neighborhoods like Lincoln Park are guaranteed a seat at the decision-making table. Yet, none of the Lincoln Park residents interviewed for this story knew about the law or the municipality’s responsibilities to comply with it. That lack of engagement has costs, including root shock and a greater detachment from the neighborhood’s history as longtime residents die or move away. Few people interviewed for this story remembered the Cawthon family, who last lived in Lincoln Park in the 1980s. The Cawthons, like many other Black Lincoln Park residents, moved there from Pittsburgh. Some transplants came from parts of the city destroyed by urban renewal: the Hill District, East Liberty, and the North Side. Joseph Cawthon worked as a Pittsburgh streetcar operator when he became the victim of a well-publicized hate crime in 1958. Christine Cawthon later became a community leader active in civil rights. Though Pittsburgh’s white newspapers didn’t attribute the attack on Cawthon to a cause, the Pittsburgh Courier alluded to it in its reporting: racism. “Get the n—,” Cawthon reportedly told police his attackers said. “[They] began to beat and kick Cawthon. The hoodlums spit in [Cawthon’s] face.” A forgotten Little Italy click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Italian immigrant stone mason Santino Rossi built this home soon after he bought two Funston Ave. lots in 1919. Penn Hills demolished the home Rossi’s daughter’s husband, Peter Katsafanas, built next door to the right The Cawthons bought their Lincoln Park home in 1954. Peter Katsafanas, a Greek immigrant who owned a successful North Side coffee company, built it in the 1920s. Katsafanas was married to Jennie Rossi, the daughter of Italian immigrants who owned a Lawrenceville gravestone company near Allegheny Cemetery. Santino and Marianna Rossi, Jennie’s parents, bought eight Lincoln Park lots on Funston Ave. between 1916 and 1920. They built a brick home, but Santino didn’t live there long, dying in 1920. Jennie and her husband Peter built a home next door to Marianna’s house. Other Rossi children got additional lots. The extended Rossi family essentially created a borgata (Italian for enclave or village), the kernel of one of many early Pittsburgh Little Italys that began similarly. “So much scholarship focuses on Little Italys with the assumption that a Little Italy has to be in an urban center,” says Melissa Marinaro, who directs the Heinz History Center’s Italian American Program. “It is showing that multi-generational style of living through a physical entity, which is the architecture, the compound. I think that is a valuable piece of material culture and a site.” By the time Marianna Rossi died in 1952, Black homeowners had begun moving into the Lincoln Park subdivision, a part of western Penn Hills that historically had been majority white. Joseph and Christine Cawthon joined other Black homeowners moving there in the 1950s. They had moved to 1903 Funston Ave. from East Liberty. The Cawthons were living there when Joseph was brutally beaten in 1958. It was their home in 1965 when Christine Cawthon worked with physician and Lincoln Park resident Dr. Charles Greenlee to end the sewage spills and dumping threatening Lincoln Park residents’ health. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Grave of Joseph Cawthon. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Grave of Joseph Cawthon. Joseph died in 1984, and Christine sold their home the next year. Christine moved to California, and she died there in 1998. A daughter, who briefly worked as a Post-Gazette reporter in the 1970s, also lived in California. Pittsburgh City Paper could not locate any of their heirs. Before razing it, Penn Hills evaluated the historical significance of the former Katsafanas and Cawthon home at 1903 Funston Ave. “This structure holds absolutely no historical value for the municipality,” wrote Planning Director Chris Blackwell. “The only historical narrative that can be discussed here is a history of neglect.” Blackwell, who is retiring in 2025, told City Paper that the paperwork Penn Hills filed with the PHMC for many of the demolished properties contained the same historical evaluation as the one for 1903 Funston Ave. “The form was filled out by me and copied many times, and the particular address was filled in by others,” Blackwell explains. Marinaro disagrees with Blackwell’s assessment. She also connects the heirs’ property issues found in Lincoln Park and in Black communities throughout the United States to the Italian Americans who lived in Penn Hills before the Black homeowners. click to enlarge Photo: Nick Childers Runnette Street (lower) and Travella Boulevard (upper) in Lincoln Park.

Still photo from video footage by Nick Childers. click to enlarge Photo: Nick Childers Lincoln Park neighborhood. Travella Blvd. is in the center of the photo with the former VA hospital and the Allegheny River in the background. “Knowing that both Italian American families and African American families in those decades were having large numbers of children,” says Marinaro, “I wonder if the legacy of those communities, if you do see more of these issues with heirs’ properties because you have larger families, and because maybe there isn't a plan in place for the future of the property or what we would call ‘wealth management.’” Contrary to what Penn Hills wrote about the former Katasafanas and Cawthon home, there’s abundant evidence that both families contributed to Penn Hills and Pittsburgh history. The former Katsafanas Coffee Company building in the North Side is part of a new Allegheny Second Ward Industrial Historic District currently being reviewed by state historic preservation officials. The Cawthons weren’t anonymous historical figures. Pittsburgh newspapers, Black- and white-run, reported on them multiple times. The former Katsafanas and Cawthon home isn’t an isolated case. Farther up Funston Av., in 2012, Penn Hills demolished the home where one of Pittsburgh’s top Mafia figures lived for more than 30 years. Joseph Rosa rented a home from his wife’s family (who owned two neighboring houses) before buying it in 1940. Local and federal law enforcement officers believed Rosa was an assassin, allegedly involved in several high-profile killings including gamblers Patsy Arabia in 1934 and Gus Gianni in 1946. Rosa had also been convicted of bombing an East Liberty bar in 1933. Neither Penn Hills nor the PHMC has any record that the municipality evaluated the former Rosa home in compliance with Section 106. Other Lincoln Park homes the municipality has razed include the former Buffalo Soldier’s home on Torrance St. described in the first part in this series, and a home once owned by Hill District photo studio owner Luther Johnson and his musician wife, Maudelena. Many longtime Lincoln Park residents refer to the Johnsons whenever the subject of neighborhood history comes up. “Do you [know] Johnson's studio?” asked Nanette Tipton in one interview. “Well, the house is torn down; it was across the street.” Tipton has lived on Travella Blvd. since 1956. Lee, one of the Lincoln Park residents who filed a 2005 complaint with the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations alleging racism by Penn Hills, mentioned the Johnsons in her first email to CP: “Maudelena Johnson was a music teacher and taught/coached many talented voice students.” (CP is using her middle name to protect her privacy.) A bronze plaque marks the last location of Johnson’s Centre Ave. photo studio; there’s nothing but a patch of grass and concrete ruins where the Johnsons’ home once stood. Penn Hills demolished the house in 1997, and the only record that survives is a two-sentence memo (in an obsolete word processing program’s format) authorizing the contract for its razing. Neglected history click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Photo: David S. RotensteinA Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County “Notice of Blight Determination” posted in a lot where Penn Hills demolished five homes in 2022. The house in the background once belonged to Pirates star Willie Stargell. Penn Hills officials say that they comply with the National Historic Preservation Act. “We have to go to the State Historic Preservation Office when we demolish a home,” says Blackwell. “I would really like to think everybody did what they were supposed to do,” says municipal manager Scott Andrejchak. He described municipal hearings and notifications in local papers. The hearing notices don’t mention Section 106, and legal ads published in newspapers inform residents that the municipality has evaluated each project and found that there are no significant environmental impacts. For each home that Penn Hills wants to demolish, planners send the PHMC photos of the building, a list of previous owners, and other information related to building codes violations and tax delinquencies. CP reviewed Penn Hills filings in a PHMC database and others that the municipality provided in response to Right to Know Law requests. None of the records CP reviewed included any historical research to justify the municipality’s conclusions that the homes were not historically significant. “All of the listed properties … are not of historical significance, have no cultural or societal importance,” reads the letter Penn Hills sent to the PHMC for the 16 demolitions proposed in 2024. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein A bronze plaque marks the Hill District site where Lincoln Park resident Luther Johnson operated a successful photo studio. Pennsylvania Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer Andrea MacDonald declined to answer questions about Penn Hills’ National Historic Preservation Act obligations. “We are unable to comment on the obligations of the municipality under Section 106,” MacDonald emailed CP. “That question should be addressed to Penn Hills Township and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, who administers the Community Development Block Grants.” HUD also declined to speak about Penn Hills’s National Historic Preservation Act compliance obligations. A HUD spokesperson replied to emailed questions, “As the Responsible Entity acting on behalf of HUD, Penn Hills is required to comply with the requirements set forth [in federal regulations], including those relative to public participation.” Blackwell says that the municipality has never identified any of the homes demolished as historically significant. Sometimes the PHMC responds to one of the municipality’s letters with questions about a particular property, or the agency informs Penn Hills that one of the houses might be historically significant. The municipality doesn’t provide the additional information requested. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein The North Side building where Penn Hills resident Peter Katsafanas operated his family’s coffee business is a landmark building in the Allegheny Second Ward Industrial Historic District. In 2024, the historic district was nominated for listing in the National Register of Historic Places as part of a National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 compliance project. “Sometimes, there's properties that are in an area, it's not a historic property, but it's an area that could be deemed historic,” says Blackwell. “Then we can't use CDBG funds for that. So occasionally we will use other funding, local funds, to demolish a structure.” “We have never torn down a structure that was deemed historic in any way,” says Blackwell. Technically, Blackwell is correct. But preservationist Wells suggests Penn Hills evades learning whether homes slated for demolition are historic by pulling CDBG funding and taking an offramp from National Historic Preservation Act compliance. “There's not any legal barrier to doing that,” says preservationist Wells. “It sounds like a fairly calculated way to avoid any issues.” “That’s What’s Happening in my neighborhood” Each time Penn Hills razes a historically significant home, the neighbors who remember the former occupants and their stories lose more connections to their community. The root shock can spread and claw deeper into the psyches of longtime Lincoln Park residents. “Black communities across the U.S. have been the victim to so many different types of oppressive tactics,” says Amber Wiley, a University of Pennsylvania historic preservation professor. “One of the issues that Black communities or other marginalized communities face in the preservation field is the long-held bias towards architectural style, architectural significance. There are any number of different measures of significance according to the law and to policy.” Wiley says that Penn Hills is only evaluating properties based on architectural characteristics and it is ignoring many other criteria that make old buildings historically significant. “You have to say folks have been creating history, living lives, and doing things that are, in fact, socially significant,” she says. By ignoring Section 106 requirements and contributing to the disintegration of Lincoln Park, Wiley agrees that the municipality’s actions could qualify as environmental racism. “I would say it does or it can fall into that category,” Wiley says. Preservationist Wells cites research by environmental psychologists to explain how people become attached to their neighborhoods over time. As neighborhoods disintegrate, residents’ mental health is affected. click to enlarge Photo: David S. Rotenstein Penn Hills Lincoln Road Waste Water Treatment Plant. Penn Hills built this plant in 1967 after being forced to clean up sewage spills into Shades Run. “I tell my mom, it's amazing, especially as Black women, that we're not all up in Western Psych dealing with the crap we have to deal with,” says Lee’s 65-year-old daughter. “You know, the microaggressions and the major aggressions. It's crazy. Every little thing.” Though she no longer lives in Lincoln Park, she asked that CP not use her name to protect her mother’s privacy. Contrary to assertions by Penn Hills officials, some Lincoln Park residents say that historic buildings have been demolished. Other buildings, like Charles Greenlee’s former home on Travella Blvd. (which is not slated to be razed — yet), are left to rot with no code enforcement action taken until the property has reached the point of no return. The municipality’s actions, they say, degrade the neighborhood’s historic character. “They should wonder why can a house, a historically significant home, sit in a state of abandonment and no one wants to do anything because of where it is? But if you changed the ZIP Code on that house, people would be all over it,” says Deborah Matthews Luckett, a Duquesne University professor who grew up on Travella Blvd. “You see historic neighborhoods in the Upper Hill, Middle Hill, and Lower Hill that are torn down … and tore-up houses all over East Liberty,” says Luckett. “I think all you have to do is just look around and you see it happening elsewhere. So I think it's almost a foregone conclusion that if I see it happening over here and over here and over here, that's what's happening in my neighborhood.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Community Development Block Grant, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lincoln Park, Penn Hills, Pittsburgh Courier, Katsafanas Coffee Company Related Content The Hill District tower wars highlight a forgotten fight against environmental racism By David S.

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo: courtesy of the Klein family. An undated photo of David Lawrence, former Pittsburgh mayor and Pennsylvania governor, with his wife and a child was found among the personal photos of gambling racketeer Jake Klein. There’s been a lot of grousing over the results of the election. The facts are simple: Donald Trump will be returning to the White House for another term. How he won is ample fodder for armchair political scientists and conspiracy theorists. One popular theory making the rounds is that billionaire Elon Musk, through his 2022 purchase of Twitter and by sinking millions of dollars into Trump campaign coffers, bought the election. It’s a tempting, though unprovable, tale, with lots of intrigue, villains, and plot twists. However, it fits neatly into the long history of rich and powerful people putting their fingers on electoral scales. In America and Pittsburgh, before billionaires, election outcomes were swayed by bottles of booze, sacks full of cash, and violence. History books and newspaper archives are filled with accounts of voter fraud, bribes, and intimidation throughout Pittsburgh’s history. The Steel City was especially corrupt and did much to distinguish itself from such cities as Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. “The vice graft, for example, was not blackmail as it is in New York and most other cities,” wrote muckraking reporter Lincoln Steffens in 1903. “It is a legitimate business, conducted, not by the police, but in an orderly fashion by syndicates, and the chairman of one of the parties at the last election said it was worth $250,000 a year.” Pittsburgh politicians, from mayors on down to aldermen (precursors to today’s council members), committed crimes to gain office and then used their positions to remain in office while directing criminal activities and profiting from corruption. Among the most corrupt were Pittsburgh Mayor Charles Kline and mayor and future Pa. Governor David L. Lawrence. Kline’s term as mayor included national attention on corruption by him and many in his administration that culminated in his indictment and forced resignation in 1932. Lawrence had close ties to bootleggers and gamblers, and he was unsuccessfully prosecuted for taking kickbacks and threatening state employees before becoming Pittsburgh’s mayor in 1946. click to enlarge The Prohibition era, from 1920 to 1933, turned political corruption in Pittsburgh into an assembly line of crime. “Members of election boards were routinely convicted of tampering with election results over the decades,” wrote Richard Gazarik in his 2018 book Wicked Pittsburgh. That tampering included dumping ballot boxes into rivers and dispatching thugs to intimidate voters at the polls. Politicians operated speakeasies and gambling clubs where gamblers and drinkers were converted into voters. Some of these joints became legendary- the Monaca Club in Oakland, for example, was owned by state senator James Coyne. It operated openly on Forbes Ave. across the street from the district police station. click to enlarge Photo: Allegheny County Criminal Court Records 1937 indictment of Gus Gianni and four others for violating Pennsylvania election laws using “duress and intimidation.” After Prohibition, the graft industry continued unabated. It was essential to flipping Pittsburgh from Republican control to a Democratic city in the wake of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1932 election victory. During the 1932 presidential election, a Lawrenceville minister told Strip District residents which names to use for getting a poll tax receipt. In one Pittsburgh neighborhood, an alderman’s nephew handed out half-dollars to voters. These are some of the typical election hijinks recounted in historian Bruce Stave’s 1970 book on Pittsburgh machine politics, The New Deal and the Last Hurrah. “Promises of money as high as ten dollars per man have been made,” wrote the Pittsburgh Courier in November 1933. “Our advice to every Negro who is promised one dollar, or five dollars or ten dollars by a Republican for his vote is to take the money, put it on your pocket and then go to the polls and vote the straight democratic [sic] ticket.” click to enlarge Photo: Allegheny County Criminal Court Records Gus Gianni and four others were indicted in 1937 for using violence to intimidate voters. The indictment alleged that they used “intimidation and coercion” to influence Sophia M. Naftz’s vote. That same election cycle, Democratic party leader Paul F. Jones told the Courier, “Despite the intimidation of the police department, racketeer’s money and whiskey, or Democratic organization … succeeded in keeping down the Republican majority.” Entrenched corruption, coupled with the city’s large union population, made Pittsburgh ripe for organized crime to gain a foothold in all of the city’s neighborhoods. August “Big Gus” Gianni was a small-time Hill District gambling racketeer. In the 1930s, he operated a numbers station out of a Hill District candy shop. “He was ‘just a bum without a shirt on Wylie Ave.,’” an associate told the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph in 1946 after Gianni’s murder. And then Gianni threw his weight around — he was five feet tall and weighed 225 pounds — at the polls, allegedly on behalf of Democratic Hill Alderman Thomas Geary. During the September 1937 primary, Gianni and four accomplices were convicted of assaulting an election judge at a Strip District polling place. Two months later, Gianni and an accomplice were convicted of intimidating voters by creating a disturbance. Gianni and his henchmen appealed their assault conviction. “The undisputed evidence discloses that someone did beat and abuse, and drive from the polling place, the Judge of Election, Patrick Colangelo,” two judges ruled, denying the appeal. Gianni’s role in the 1937 election was his ticket to the Pittsburgh mob’s top tier, and he was given control of numbers rackets in Oakland and Shadyside. click to enlarge Photo: Pittsburgh City Photographer collection via historicpittsburgh.org. A car with a spare tire cover promoting the reelection of Mayor Charles H. Kline in the 1929 election. News accounts of voter intimidation from the 2024 election pale in comparison to the events of 1937. Yet the implications are the same. The law (and conviction) should be upheld “so that persons may cast their ballots unmolested,” wrote the judges who ruled in Gianni’s appeal. Politics in the “before Billionaires” era was a big game sport. While methods have changed since the freewheeling days of Prohibition, there’s a throughline in the staggering sums of money being spent to influence election outcomes. Pay to play and dirty tricks aren’t blue or red, Democratic or Republican — they’re the American way.

Rotenstein click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein A man helps to push Norman White uphill along Centre Ave. towards the YMCA where he tried to recharge his wheelchair. Life in the 21st century sometimes means scrambling to find a plug to recharge a dying cell phone. Most folks can walk into a coffee shop or the lobby of a public building to tap into some needed electricity. But what if you are unhoused and rely on an electric wheelchair to get to a bathroom or to find food, temporary shelter, or a cooling center in a heat emergency? You have a lot fewer options to plug in. That’s what Norman White discovered recently when he tried to recharge his wheelchair using outdoor outlets along Centre Ave. in the Hill District. White’s quest for power in public spaces exposed a frayed safety net designed on the cheap and woven on a one-size-fits-all loom. The 55-year-old Hill District native lost his Carnegie apartment in April. Since then, he’s been navigating the streets where he grew up, panhandling and looking for food, water, and electricity. Some of the outlets White has tried to use belong to properties developed on land formerly owned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Norman White lived in a first-floor apartment in this Carnegie building until he was evicted in April. “These people, they’re getting all of this money from the government or whatever they're getting to build a community,” White said while parked at a Centre Ave. bus shelter a few days before an oppressive heatwave bore down on Pittsburgh. “I never did anything to anyone up here, and I can't do anything without my wheelchair. I can't stand, I can't walk. They got plugs outside some of the buildings, so I plug up my chair and in the next couple of minutes, somebody is coming and taking the plug out, saying I can't do it.” White’s plight is an equity issue that was unknown to the city’s affordable housing community and to elected officials. Before Pittsburgh City Paper reached out to County councilmember-at-large Bethany Hallam, she had never considered that access to electricity by unhoused people was a survival issue. “It truly never crossed my mind,” Hallam says. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Norman White sits in his wheelchair at the Centre Ave. bus shelter where he spends much of his time. Upon learning about White’s situation, Hallam drove through the Hill looking for him. She ultimately was able to get White a cellphone, some clothes, and pathway to a shelter. “When there are public dollars used, there should be public accessibility. That is a no-brainer,” Hallam says. “When you receive public dollars for your project, you should be required to have not just an ADA-accessible city, but also access for the public when they need to use electricity or bathrooms or water fountains.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Hill CDC executive director Marimba Milliones speaks at the May 2023 groundbreaking for the New Granada Theatre rehabilitation project. The New Granada Square Apartments is one of the properties where White has tried to recharge his chair. Completed in 2023, the mixed-use development bookends the 2100 block of Centre Ave. where the Hill CDC is redeveloping the long-abandoned New Granada Theater. The Hill CDC bought the parcels from the URA. Cleveland-based CHN Housing Partners manages the 40 apartments built there. There are two outside outlets in the property’s Centre Ave. façade. White said that he has been asked to leave the property by its manager multiple times. One time, the manager called the police. “She was, you know, giving me orders to get out of here,” White says. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Norman White sits in his wheelchair at the Centre Ave. bus shelter where he spends much of his time. White clearly recalls what the manager told him: “You don't pay rent here and pay for electricity, and people don't want you here.” The New Granada Square Apartments property manager referred questions to the company’s corporate headquarters. CHN spokesperson Laura Boustani says that tenants had complained about White, and says that the property manager had several encounters with White, including one where she told him to leave by 5 p.m. “Please don't come back because this is a private property and we have residents here that pay,” Boustani says the property manager told White. After that, the apartments cut the power to the outlets along Centre Ave. White then tried to charge his chair using an outlet in the vestibule. Again, the property manager told him to leave. Boustani confirms that the outlets were disabled after the property manager discovered White charging his chair. “It is private property,” Boustani says. “Our responsibility is to our residents to make sure they're comfortable and they're secure and safe.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Norman White Like Hallam, Hill CDC executive director Marimba Milliones had been unaware of the need for public electricity outlets. “Learning of this issue has been an education for the Hill CDC. It’s clear that additional public charging stations are needed throughout the neighborhood, city, and county,” Milliones wrote in an emailed response to an interview request. Though he’s from the Hill and living there again, albeit on the streets, White finds compassion in the people who bring him water and who help him to move when his chair’s batteries run dry. He repeatedly apologizes for the pungent smell that surrounds him. Unable to leave his chair, White urinates and defecates in it. “A friend of mine went out of his way, I guess he smelled me, and he went and brought this urinal thing that I could take with me and I could stick under my clothes and go to the bathroom,” White said. Living on the streets in the Hill District during a record-setting heatwave is the latest in a long line of misfortunes and indignities in White’s life. When he was 19, he robbed a Hill District bar and was shot as he was fleeing. Police arrested White for the robbery and took the gun he used. They subsequently determined that the gun had belonged to a Wilkinsburg jitney driver who died after struggling with White, whom they says tried to rob him. In 1989, a judge convicted White of third-degree murder, robbery, theft, and receiving stolen property. “I did 15 years straight in prison,” White says. “I missed all my 20s and half of my 30s.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Norman White tries to recharge his wheelchair behind a Centre Ave. apartment building early one morning. After returning to Pittsburgh, White worked with at-risk youth and in retail. In 2006, he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. “I've had four operations since. I've been up on my feet every time. This last time, it just got so bad, I ended up in this chair,” he says. White has used his wheelchair for a year and was living in a first-floor apartment when his landlord, Monroeville-based Arbor Management Inc., evicted him. “They didn't want to renew my lease because my wheelchair was messing up the walls and door hinges and stuff, and they were getting fines for my rent, and they didn't want to build me a ramp,” White says. The Landlord/Tenant complaint filed in Carnegie Magistrate’s Court shows that White had failed to pay multiple months’ rent. “No one here at Arbors is going to speak to you or the press,” the company’s portfolio manager and complaint author, Marlayna Marquinez, emailed in response to a request for information about the building and White’s case. Out on the street, White’s wheelchair has two batteries that can take him between 13 and 21 miles on a single charge, according to the manufacturer. It takes between eight and 14 hours to fully recharge them. Based on the types of battery and charging time, it can cost less than 50 cents to fully recharge, according to a source who works in the electricity industry. White rarely gets a chance to stay in one place long enough to get a full charge. If he’s not being forced to unplug from outdoor outlets, Centre Ave. businesses limit the amount of time he’s allowed to plug in. After getting a push uphill on Centre Ave. to the YMCA, he was told that he could only stay in the lobby for an hour. The building doesn’t appear to have any exterior outlets. YMCA staff did not respond to City Paper’s request for an interview or comment. Pittsburgh’s Office of Community Health and Safety said in an emailed statement, “OCHS hasn’t had this concern raised by our service participants.” The statement suggested that people requiring electricity could charge at public libraries, the now-closed Second Ave. Commons and other places “during hours of operations.” The Carnegie Library Hill District branch one block away from the YMCA also doesn’t have any outside outlets. The same with a nearby First National Bank branch and The Legacy apartment building next door. The New Granada Square Apartments have the closest outdoor outlets to where White spends most of his time. In the same block, the Hill CDC headquarters and the Federal Credit Union office don’t have outside outlets. The Zone 2 police station has an outdoor outlet in the back. Lt. Dan Reed says that White could recharge there, for short periods of time. “I would have no problem with him doing that,” Reed says. “[But] he’s going to have to find a long-term solution.” White admits that he would never recharge at a police station. “You get a stigma about using it, being around the police and stuff like that,” he says. But what about properties like the New Granada Square Apartments? It was built on parcels assembled by the URA and the project received financing from multiple sources, including the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency and federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The long-term solution, says Hallam, requires changing the ways that developers benefit from public assistance with their projects. The councilmember says that she will explore ways to attach conditions to future approvals for developers and projects receiving public funding. “Something that I'm definitely going to be looking into immediately is can we put the same restrictions as we do for TIFs and LERTAs for tax incentives that developers receive on public access to electricity and bathrooms,” Hallam says. CP was unable to get responses to multiple requests for comment from Mayor Ed Gainey and Hill District City Councilmember Daniel Lavelle. White was arrested for retail theft in Scott Township in late June. The phone Hallam got him is no longer in service.

Rotenstein click to enlarge Photo courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh Archives Hilliards St. in 1959. The Belmar Gardens buildings are to the left and in the background. Belmar Gardens, a development with 118 townhomes in Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, was one of Pittsburgh’s earliest Black-owned and developed subdivisions. The brainchild of a Pittsburgh Courier columnist and the wives of other Courier leaders, Belmar Gardens became Pittsburgh’s first cooperative housing development funded by a Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgage. When the neighborhood was completed in 1955, renowned photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris captured every step in black and white photos, from clearing the property to the first families moving in. It was a milestone moment in a city marked by neighborhoods destroyed by urban renewal and restricted by real estate exclusions. Belmar Gardens became a homeownership success story and an important part of Pittsburgh’s Black history. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Belmar Gardens click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Belmar Gardens Large numbers of Southern Black migrants came to the Steel City during the Great Migration between 1910 and 1970 in search of better jobs and to escape Jim Crow racism. Instead, they found different types of violence and exclusion, leading many to dub Pittsburgh the “Mississippi of the North.” Despite many roadblocks thrown up by workplace, housing and educational discrimination, a thriving Black middle class emerged here. Doctors, attorneys, journalists, teachers, musicians and a highly-acclaimed architect were among their numbers, while some racketeers and others likewise prospered. As these men and women accumulated wealth, they outgrew such historically Black neighborhoods as the Hill District and parts of the North Side. “We knew as young people coming up in a Black community — and this was the same in every Black community in the city of Pittsburgh — that if you went to certain areas, you would not be able to rent,” explained historian Ralph Proctor before he died last year. “You would not be able to buy property.” These Black professionals had the means to buy housing that fit their status, but yinzer-flavored Jim Crow practices frequently blocked the way. Some people bought homes in East End neighborhoods and others moved to suburbs like Penn Hills. In 1950, Congress passed a new housing act enabling the FHA to insure mortgages for housing cooperatives. A form of collective ownership, housing cooperatives are like clubs where people apply for membership. Instead of access to a clubhouse, the members get a home. There had been cooperative housing before that, but those properties were usually apartment buildings in big cities like New York. click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Belmar Gardens click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Belmar Gardens The new law opened the floodgates for new housing projects in cities and suburbs throughout the country. Groups that historically faced significant housing discrimination, from Jews in Washington, D.C. to African Americans in New York, suddenly had a pathway to homeownership. So too did union workers and others who needed to pool their resources in order to afford a new home. In 1952, Pittsburgh Courier columnist Paul L. Jones and Maybelle Nunn, Helen Prattis, Corrine Lindsay, and Frances Nunn founded Belmar Gardens. Maybelle Nunn was married to Courier managing editor William G. Nunn Sr., and Frances Nunn was married to columnist and sportswriter William G. Nunn Jr. Jones had been writing about housing for years. Lindsay was an undertaker’s wife whose daughter worked for the Courier. The group hired New York developer William Brafman to build the subdivision. Brafman had recently completed the highly-acclaimed Merrick Park Gardens in Jamaica, New York. “This is the first project undertaken by a Negro group,” an FHA racial relations officer wrote in a 1953 agency publication. Brafman, a white attorney turned real estate professional, leveraged that experience in Pittsburgh. Brafman and the Prattises assembled 9.2 hilltop acres for the development. Numbers racketeer and Hill District barbershop owner William “Woogie” Harris owned a stately Victorian home — now known as the National Opera Company House — down the hill, and he sold Brafman 2.9 acres for the development. click to enlarge Photo: Belmar Gardens City Archives Belmar Gardens stock certificate click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein Belmar Gardens “Well, my Uncle Woogie had part of the property going up there,” recalled Crystal Harris, Teenie Harris’s daughter. The 1950 Housing Act created two types of cooperatives: management and sales. Belmar Gardens was a “management type” cooperative. In this model, each resident became a subscriber whose monthly payment went towards paying down the mortgage and taxes. “The houses are row type, built six to eight in a row,” Brafman told a congressional committee in 1953. “[They were] separate, individual houses, having individual heating systems, utilities, garages, and basements.” Brafman built two streets inside the horseshoe-shaped development, Tilden St. and Vann Rd. — named for Courier publisher Robert L. Vann, who died in 1940. The first families moved into Belmar Gardens in 1954. Legally, anyone could buy a Belmar Gardens home. “The members of Belmar Gardens are all Negroes, although the offering was not limited to any particular group,” Brafman told Congress. Pittsburgh’s entrenched segregation practices enabled Black families to create a neighborhood free from white harassment and surveillance because no white families wanted to live there. Belmar Gardens quickly attracted notable Pittsburghers, among them pioneering broadcaster Mal Goode and jazz crooner Jerry Betters. Many more less distinguished families also lived there, including James and Mary Truman, whose family papers are archived in the Heinz History Center. Among the Truman family documents are the family’s 1954 subscription agreement to occupy 7120 Vann Dr. They paid $70 a month for their 5-room home and each month’s payment increased the family’s equity in the property. The family also kept a copy of the 1995 New Pittsburgh Courier article reporting on Belmar Gardens residents’ burning their mortgage and the 1961 stock certificate marking the transfer to the Trumans’ married daughter, Ella Gaddie. Longtime Pittsburgh residents remember Belmar Gardens as one of the few Black developments here before the 1980s. “Blacks were building houses even prior to Belmar Gardens being built,” explained Donald Miller, who grew up in the Upper Hill District’s Sugar Top neighborhood. Chip Boykin, whose family owned a popular barbecue restaurant chain, grew up in a single-family home on Oakdene St. just outside of Belmar Gardens. “All those houses and stuff were more of a planned-type thing,” Boykin says of the Belmar Gardens homes. He doesn’t recall any divisions separating the street where he lived from the people in Belmar Gardens. “I guess we didn't see it as that and stuff like that,” Boykin says. “It was just, you know, part of the neighborhood at that point.” Very little has changed in Belmar Gardens since the 1950s. At a time when Pittsburgh struggles to solve an affordable housing shortfall, Belmar Gardens remains shareholder-owned, and local affordable housing advocates point to it as a successful cooperative housing model.

Rotenstein click to enlarge PHOTO: Lower Hill Redevelopment Area Properties, City of Pittsburgh Mack McGee was living in this building at 1417 Pasture Lane in the Hill District when he was arrested in February 1909. The Pittsburgh Courier once dubbed Wylie Ave. in the Hill District as \"the street that begins at a church and ends in jail.\" Indeed, as a new report confirms, for decades, Wylie Ave. was as much Black Pittsburgh's Main Street as it was an unjust pipeline to prison. A recent article by the Equal Justice Initiative — an organization dedicated to ending mass icarceration — tells the story of an episode that unfolded in February 1909, when police rounded up more than 200 Black Pittsburghers and arrested them on spurious charges. Like much in Pittsburgh’s Black history, the 1909 events had been long forgotten. Many of the buildings on Wylie that bore witness to them have been torn down, replaced by vacant lots. Even local historians were caught off guard by the EJI article. The story they tell took place 115 years ago, but it’s been echoed in recent years by familiar cycles of police violence and racial unrest. Founded by lawyer Bryan Stevenson, the EJI is best known for its legal advocacy and educational efforts, including the widely acclaimed National Memorial for Peace and Justice (also known as the lynching memorial) in Montgomery, Ala. Its 1909 roundup story was one in a series of articles the organization has published. “EJI produces a calendar that highlights examples of racial injustice throughout history,” a spokesperson emailed in response to questions about the story. “We researched the Pittsburgh narrative, and we’ve had it in our annual calendar for years.” Mass hysteria fuels mass incarceration The EJI piece highlights the story of Rial and Irene Lucas. The couple were living above Harrison’s Pool Hall at 1810 Wylie Ave. when they found themselves caught up in a wave of mass racial violence triggered by a white woman claiming that she had been assaulted. Ida O’Neil was a white 20-year-old office worker whose scream the eve of Feb. 2, 1909, attracted the attention of a woman living nearby. She and another woman told police that they had seen a Black man running away from the Hill District scene. Within hours of the alleged event, O’Neil tentatively identified Mack McGee as the man who assaulted her. “That looks like him,” The Pittsburgh Press quoted O’Neil the next day. But she wasn’t sure. McGee was among more than 100 Black men questioned in the hours after the alleged assault. “All kinds and classes of men were up before the magistrate this morning,” wrote the Press on February 3, 1909. “Some were manifestly harmless and were quickly discharged. In the collection of 125 prisoners, however, there were some negroes who looked to be distinctly undesirable citizens.” The men in the latter group, two-thirds of those picked up, were charged as “suspicious persons” and sent to the Allegheny County Jail downtown or the Allegheny County Workhouse near Blawnox. click to enlarge PHOTO: Pittsburgh Press via newspapers.com. Mack McGee was the first Hill District resident accused of assaulting Ida O’Neil. The Pittsburgh Press published this photo of him shortly after his arrest. McGee was one of the unlucky ones kept in custody. He was picked out of a police lineup by a white man who “chased” a Black man after another alleged assault on a different woman. The strongest evidence that police had against McGee: they’d recovered an old coat and a hat when they searched his Pasture Lane apartment. O’Neil told the police that the man who attacked her wore a cap with “ribs” in it, the Pittsburgh Post reported. The paper added, “McGee wears a corduroy cap of that description.” Though McGee ultimately was cleared of the alleged O’Neil assault, he nonetheless was fined $10 and sent to the Workhouse. It was his third (or fourth) trip there since 1905 — the others were for disorderly conduct and for being a “suspicious person.” Under a Pittsburgh ordinance passed in 1867, anyone charged as a “suspicious person” in the city appeared before a police magistrate, who could unilaterally decide to summarily fine and imprison that person, no jury, no attorneys required. After clearing McGee, the police then turned their attention to Lucas. By that point, newspapers around the nation had been publishing sensational articles beneath bold headlines reporting that police had rounded up between 200 and 1,000 Black Pittsburghers. click to enlarge PHOTO: Pittsburgh Press via newspapers.com. Photo of Rial Lucas published in the Pittsburgh Post Feb. 9, 1909, shortly after his arrest for allegedly assaulting Ida O’Neil. Rial Octavious Lucas was born in 1881 in Washington, D.C. Lucas attended public school there until he was 17. According to Pennsylvania penitentiary records, he was 5’4” and a moderate drinker. In Washington, he worked as a day laborer and was living with his mother and her second husband. By 1906, Lucas and his sister Bertie were living on Wylie Ave. He was working as a janitor when he married domestic worker Irene Watson in 1907. Watson was born in 1886 in Delaware. In 1900, she was living with her widowed mother, two brothers and a sister in Philadelphia. Watson was 5’2”, and she attended public school until she was 12. For reasons unknown — the original criminal case files are missing — police arrested the Lucases on Feb. 7, 1909. Less than two months after O’Neil’s alleged attack, a Pittsburgh jury, after deliberating for just 16 minutes, sentenced Rial Lucas to nine years in the Western Penitentiary on Pittsburgh's North Side. Newspapers described the charge against him as “assault”; the charge listed in his prison intake record was “rape.” It took only two days for Irene Lucas to be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted as a “suspicious person.” She spent 30 days in the Allegheny County Workhouse — the maximum sentence for a first-time offender. The road to remembering The Courier’s clever Wylie Ave. motto was an apt metaphor for many Black residents and visitors who found themselves swept from the avenue’s nightclubs, pool halls, newsstands, and homes into a pipeline ending at the Allegheny County Jail. The two buildings at opposite ends of the street also are a stark visual reminder of how Pittsburgh remembers and commemorates white history while the city forgets and erases its Black history and landmarks. Between the 1890s and 1950, racial violence erupted in communities throughout the United States. In 1898, dozens of Black residents were killed and Black elected officials were removed from office in Wilmington, N.C. White mobs went on a killing spree in Atlanta, Ga., in 1906 after newspapers published stories alleging assaults on white women. In the summer of 1919, more than two dozen communities experienced racial violence resulting in hundreds of Black deaths. Whites destroyed Tulsa, Okla.’s, Greenwood community — dubbed the Black Wall Street — in 1921. And, in 1923 a white mob rampaged through Rosewood, Fla., killing more than 30 people. Those episodes don’t include more than 4,400 racial violence lynchings that the EJI has documented. A common thread running through many of these cases involves a white woman alleging that she had been assaulted or insulted by a Black man. Such breaches of segregation etiquette had one verdict, guilty, and a single sentence in Jim Crow’s vigilante court: death. Despite making headlines around the nation as the events unfolded here in 1909, Pittsburgh histories are silent about the episode. Even local historians and university faculty members who have written many books about the Black experience here were taken by surprise when they read the EJI article. “I was not aware of that episode,” Carnegie Mellon University history professor Joe William Trotter Jr. tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “I think that we just haven't done enough work, you know, to really uncover the many dimensions of the Black experience in the city over a long period of time.” Laurence Glasco, who has taught history at the University of Pittsburgh since 1969, hadn’t known of the 1909 episode when the EJI contacted him as a source for their article. “I was really stunned by it and fascinated to learn about it, because it goes against a lot of what we know about race and race relations in the Hill district historically,” Glasco explained. Trotter connects the 2024 exposure of the 1909 episode to some of the reasons it has been forgotten or erased by historians. “One of the things we have to keep in mind is that, very often, the research is driven about the politics of our times, right. I mean, it's almost inevitable,” he says. click to enlarge PHOTO: courtesy of David Rotenstein Black Lives Matter memorial signs once on Centre Ave. in East Liberty Neither Trotter nor Glasco could definitively explain what kept the violent rhetoric in 1909 — calls for lynching — from leaping off newspaper front pages into the streets and deadly, destructive actions. “It didn't break out into that — you don't have deaths coming out of this,” Trotter says. “We still have to say there was something about Pittsburgh that prevented that kind of violence from gaining ground.” The historian speculated that officials prevented escalations in episodes like these by promising swift justice. “Even if the state sort of curtailed the violence, or helped to curtail the violence, it didn't totally exonerate the city from a pattern of racial hostility visited upon Black people.” History repeats itself The actions by Pittsburgh police in 1909 resonate today. The pipeline to prison and police violence in Black communities are as close as daily headlines and social media timelines. Demonstrations against expanding the carceral state include the global protests in the wake of George Floyd’s 2020 murder in Minneapolis and the #StopCopCity movement that spread from Atlanta as activists try to prevent the construction of a massive police training facility. The legacy of 1909’s excesses may be found in the deaths of Jonny Gammage in 1995, Antwon Rose in 2018, and Jim Rodgers in 2021. Local protests in the summer of 2020 yielded many complaints of police extremes. Like much in Pittsburgh’s Black history, had it not been for EJI, Rial Lucas’s nine years in Western Penitentiary might have been forgotten and erased altogether. The prison itself, slated for demolition, is a painful and palpable monument to inequities in law enforcement and criminal justice. “We don't want to keep something that has had a major negative impact on Black people and in our neighborhood,” Angel Gober, president of the Marshall-Shadeland Civic Group, told WESA last year. In his 1984 memoir Brothers and Keepers, John Edgar Wideman, the award-winning Pittsburgh-born author, made the prison the setting for his brother’s incarceration and a central character. “Western Penitentiary sprouts like a giant wart from the bare, flat stretches of concrete surrounding it,” Wideman wrote. To Wideman, Western Penitentiary punished its inmates and their loved ones by dehumanizing them. Wideman’s take on the prison captures the sentiments held by Black Pittsburghers: revulsion, not nostalgia. Compare that to the efforts by white historic preservationists who sought to protect the landmark which in 2022 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The conflicting views of the impending demolition underscore the need to better understand history holistically and equitably. They also speak to how Pittsburgh preserves its Black history landmarks: the jail at one end of Wylie Ave. is a tourist attraction with a brass plaque, and the church at the other end is condemned. Thanks to efforts by EJI and new generations of local historians, sunlight is illuminating important stories from Pittsburgh’s past. These stories are important reminders that remembering the past is key to ensuring that we learn from past inequities and don’t repeat them in the future. It’s a lesson that is taking a long time to sink in. Correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled Bryan Stevenson's name. The error has been corrected.

She and two other Pittsburghers were camping near the proposed site of a controversial $90 million police training facility when they were arrested on Jan. 18. They were there to oppose the Atlanta facility, dubbed “Cop City.” Now, they’re among the first people to be charged under Georgia’s anti-domestic terrorism law passed in 2017. Some Pittsburghers have joined a loosely-knit coalition of community groups, environmental activists, and prison abolitionists opposing the training center, going against the will of some of Georgia’s wealthiest and most institutionally powerful interests. But the controversy hits closer to home. Local activists are also voicing concerns about Pittsburgh’s plans for its own expensive police training center, which they worry would fuel police militarization, pollution, and violence against Black Pittsburghers. Some see what’s happening in Atlanta as a precursor to what could unfold here. Here’s what has gone down in Georgia: Initial construction appears to be underway on the Atlanta training center, amid reports of escalating state repression against protesters, including what experts are calling the first police killing of an environmental activist in modern U.S. history. The training center, which proponents call the Atlanta Institute for Social Justice and Public Safety Training, would include a mock city for police to practice raids (which opponents term “urban warfare”) as well as a shooting range and explosives testing site. Building the center would require clearcutting dozens of acres of the South River Forest, which environmental conservationists say will worsen the region’s heatwaves, flooding, and heavy metals pollution. Despite significant opposition, plans for the facility have been pushed through official channels by the nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit group almost entirely funded by major corporations, including Home Depot, Amazon, UPS, and Delta Airlines. The foundation is reportedly fronting two-thirds of the facility’s $90 million price tag. After failing to halt the project by appealing to elected officials, a grassroots, decentralized movement emerged. The movement has been staging encampments throughout the forest, occupying trees slated for destruction in “tree-sits,” and sabotaging construction equipment. click to enlarge Photo: Sarah Wasilewski Sarah Wasilewski in a hammock in Atlanta’s South River Forest In recent months, Georgia authorities have sought to characterize Cop City protesters as “terrorists,” slapping domestic terrorism charges on individuals like Wasilewski. Her arrest warrant does not accuse her of any harmful or dangerous actions, but charges her because of her alleged affiliation with the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, being a “known member of a prison abolition movement,” and trespassing in the South River Forest. Wasilewski tells Pittsburgh City Paper she had spent the days before her arrest cleaning up wreckage from a recent police raid and real estate tycoon Ryan Millsap’s demolition of a public park within the forest, which he claims to own through a legally-contested land swap. “They're definitely trying to make it look like we're a bunch of thugs in the woods, and my experience there was it's a bunch of, like, tree-hugging hippies,” she tells City Paper. “It’s very clear that they don’t actually think we’re terrorists,” she adds, noting that the police declined to search her bags or belongings, although they did confiscate her cell phone and car, neither of which has been returned to her. “Their tactic now is just to incarcerate anyone who gets in their way.” Wasilewski spent four days in DeKalb County Jail before being released on $15,000 bail, which she says she could not have paid without the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, a group committed to legal support for Cop City protesters. She has yet to be officially indicted and may eventually have to return to Atlanta to stand trial. Subsequent protesters charged with domestic terrorism are currently held at the county jail, some without bail and some with bail assigned at $355,000. “I know they’re doing that to scare everyone,” Wasilewski tells City Paper, arguing the police hope to squash further opposition. “If they succeed, and we go to prison, they're obviously ruining a bunch of people's lives, but that means they can do that for every potential protester.” Civil liberties experts have also condemned the arrests and the contentious law underpinning them. “Laws like this quell speech, and it’s really supposed to do nothing but make sure that you do not criticize the government,” Christopher Bruce, policy and advocacy director for the Georgia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, tells Al Jazeera. click to enlarge Photo: Sarah Wasilewski Protestors at Atalnta's South River Forest Wasilewski, and other local representatives working for racial justice tell City Paper they see parallels between Cop City and an expensive police training center planned for Pittsburgh. In 2020, the City of Pittsburgh acquired the former Veterans Affairs Hospital in Lincoln-Lemington from the federal government, at no cost, in order to build a regional training facility for police and emergency responders. A proposal to develop the 168-acre parcel have been in the works since at least 2018, and despite the absence of concrete plans, city officials have recently said the project will cost more than $120 million. Former Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto initially proposed relocating police and emergency services headquarters, the police training academy, animal control, and the city’s vehicle repair shop to the Lincoln-Lemington site. Current Mayor Ed Gainey’s spokesperson Maria Montaño tells City Paper the scope of the project has since narrowed to focus on police training facilities, and that, despite the reduction in scope, the estimated cost of the project remains over $120 million. Montaño did not answer City Paper’s questions about how the city intends to fund the more than $120 million project, except to say that the administration doesn’t “see a role or opportunity for private funding.” The 2023 capital budget has kept $17 million in future capital bonds, first proposed by Peduto in 2021, to fund the training center. Beyond that, it remains unclear where the money will come from. “The concern in Atlanta is also the concern here,” says Muhammad Ali Nasir, advocacy, policy, and civic engagement coordinator for the activist arts nonprofit 1Hood. Since the Atlanta Police Foundation estimates that 43% of trainees at the new center will come from out-of-state, opponents argue that its construction would contribute to increased police militarization across the country and the globe. “Cop City, if built, will set a new precedent for police militarization, not just in Atlanta, not just in the southeast, not just in the country, but in the world,“ says Jonah Sylvester, an organizer with the Weelaunee Defense Society of Pittsburgh. Nasir says he is concerned both that Pittsburgh police might train at the Atlanta facility and that a $120 million city investment in police training would further exacerbate what he already considers an excessive militarization of local police. “I literally watched police rolling down in armored vehicles in the streets of Downtown. We’ve seen them deploy military tactics on peaceful protesters, completely unprovoked,” Nasir tells City Paper, recalling his experience of the Pittsburgh Police response to the May 30, 2020 protest against the police murder of George Floyd. Nasir is also concerned by the Atlanta and proposed Pittsburgh centers’ location within predominantly Black neighborhoods. “The similarity is a little stark to me because Lincoln-Lemington is 65% Black, the same way that [the closest neighborhood to Cop City] is 75% Black… We know that that training is going to be deployed against primarily Black people, that’s kind of the bottom line,” he says. Although Black people make up less than a quarter of the Pittsburgh population, police data from 2019 shows that more than 60% of the time Pittsburgh officers used force, it was against Black individuals, and that 71.4% of the subjects of all frisks were Black. click to enlarge Photo: Sarah Wasilewski Vigil in honor of Tortuguita who the police killed on Jan. 18, in Color Park on the Southside on Fri., Jan. 27. Pittsburgh activists also share Cop City opponents’ concerns that police operations, especially those involving munitions and explosives, inflict environmental harm in the surrounding area. The Peduto administration initially framed the project as green and sustainable, but Meghsha Barner, legal advocate at the Abolitionist Law Center, tells City Paper a new police training center is neither green nor environmentally sustainable. “Similar to Cop City, politicians claim this is an environmentally sound choice, when we know militarized police contribute to pollution, and money poured into police coffers could instead be used to actually make Pittsburgh a greener, safer city,” they say. Last week, Pittsburgh organizers held a week of educational and advocacy events in solidarity with the movement to stop Cop City, from a letter-writing campaign to currently incarcerated forest defenders and workshops on transformative justice. Next week, organizers in Atlanta are calling for a Week of Action from March 4 to 11, inviting the public to come to the forest for a two-day music festival, as well as discussions, workshops, and other ways to get involved in the movement. “It is an invitation for everyone and anyone interested in stopping Cop City to come to Atlanta to join the movement,” says Sylvester. “And truly, everyone, including, you know, mothers and grandparents — whoever you are, this is the time to come to Atlanta.” As for Pittsburgh’s training center, in November 2022, city officials said there is no timeline for when construction will begin. Last year, City Council reallocated $1.4 million set aside for the project to a string of infrastructure improvements throughout the city. Barnes says the recent reallocation of funds indicates that “Pittsburgh realizes that money allocated to this project is better spent elsewhere.” “We hope that trend continues,” they say. “Pittsburgh doesn’t need or want a Cop City.” Visit StopCopCitySolidarity.org for information on the March 4-11 Week of Action.

Legal experts see a human rights issue By James Paul click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Former Allegheny County Jail inmate Terry Fluker poses for a portrait on the Smithfield Street Bridge as fog fills the river. Terry Fluker's doctor took him to the back room of a clinic in Atlanta, Georgia and told him he was going to die. Getting diagnosed with HIV in the late 1980s — back when the prognosis was a near death sentence — also instilled in Fluker a depression that would exist alongside the virus for the next 30 years of his life. When Fluker went into the Allegheny County Jail on a shoplifting charge last year with several active prescriptions, including for a once-daily HIV medication and an antidepressant, he says there was a period when he wasn't able to access any of it. \"These are important medications that people should get,\" Fluker says. \"When a person is suicidal, and you're not giving them their medication, then that causes the person to harm themselves.\" Fluker is one of several inmates and activists who say medication access issues plague the Allegheny County Jail, with inefficient distribution and inconsistent dosing damaging inmates' health and, in some cases, endangering their lives. Legal advocates say the jail's faulty medical care infrastructure may amount to a series of ongoing constitutional violations. Jesse Geleynse, the public information officer for the jail, told Pittsburgh City Paper in an email that the jail has no comment on the claims by former and current inmates as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prevents the jail from discussing or releasing any personal information. Fluker says he served roughly five months at the jail before being booked into alternative housing. A diagnosed schizophrenic, he says he rejected medication for two months in that period with the belief that the jail was trying to poison him. In alternative housing — where he stayed for less than a week before being rebooked at the jail following an altercation — a doctor convinced Fluker to get back on his medication for several health conditions, including HIV, depression, and high blood pressure. Back at the jail, Fluker says he filed multiple prescription requests to no avail. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson The Allegheny County Jail on Feb. 4, 2024. For two weeks, Fluker says he asked for Biktarvy, his once-a-day HIV medication, and never got it. For one month, Fluker says he requested his previously prescribed clonidine, a high-blood pressure medication, and never got it. He says for his entire 181 days of incarceration, he never received his antidepressant, mirtazapine. Sarah McBeth, a doctor and the medical director of Allies for Health + Wellbeing, notes that, although it wasn't acutely dangerous for Fluker to be off his HIV medication for two weeks, month-long periods without it can critically increase the amounts of the virus in a person’s bloodstream. \"We recognize that these medications are life-sustaining treatments, and we emphasize to patients the importance of taking those medications every day over the long term to protect their immune system and, therefore, avoid life-threatening infections that can result from AIDS,\" McBeth tells CP. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Terry Fluker walks across the Smithfield Street Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh. As for the clonidine, McBeth says doctors are typically hesitant to prescribe the heavy-duty medication because it can cause major spikes in blood pressure if a patient misses a dose. She says in Fluker's case, being unable to access his medication for a month could have been potentially dangerous. Muhammad Ali Nasir, an incarceration reform activist also known by his emcee name, MAN-E, says through conversations with people held at the jail — and by way of what he saw when he was held there as a juvenile in 2005, and for protesting the killing of George Floyd Jr. in 2020 — stories like Fluker's are far too familiar. \"Most people are waiting for days to be seen when they request medical care,\" Nasir, a recent appointee to the Allegheny County Jail Oversight Board, says. \"Some people may come in with prescriptions from their doctors on the outside and will not receive the medication that they need.\" click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Former Allegheny County Jail inmate Terry Fluker poses for a portrait on the Smithfield Street Bridge as fog fills the river. A current inmate at the jail (CP has chosen to keep her anonymous) told CP she didn't receive any of her previously prescribed medication for days after her arrest and likened the jail's intake process to \"being thrown in a dog kennel.\" She says this was only the start of a long-lasting medication drought to come for several of her prescriptions. Her medical records confirm that, for nearly eight months between April 2023 and December 2023, she did not receive her previously prescribed gabapentin to treat the pain resulting from diagnosed neuropathy. Back on the oral medication since January of this year, she says she receives it at inconsistent times and often only two out of her three prescribed daily doses. McBeth characterized neuropathy as a painful condition that can lead to a lack of function due to numbness in the hands or feet. Not receiving pain medication can worsen its effects, and receiving it at inconsistent times can leave gaps of unmedicated pain or result in overmedication if it's administered too soon after the last dose, McBeth says. Geleynse told CP in an email that the jail automatically gives inmates any medication that was prescribed to them in the last 30 days before their arrest, but only if it’s on the county government pharmacy’s formulary. “If the medication is not on the jail’s formulary, the jail makes a priority appointment with a jail healthcare provider to assess symptoms and obtain the appropriate replacement,” Geleynse said. “In these instances, there is not a standard replacement for a medication not on the formulary — it is all individualized.” If the medication wasn’t recently prescribed, the inmate must visit the jail healthcare provider for a new script, Geleynse said. Alexandra Morgan-Kurtz, the deputy director of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, says the Eighth and 14th Amendments require jails and prisons to provide inmates with their medication as prescribed. The ACJ’s actions rise to the level of “deliberate indifference” to inmates' needs under the Eighth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, Morgan-Kurtz tells CP. \"[The Allegheny County Jail is] probably one of the worst county jails in Pennsylvania in providing constitutionally required access to health care in a timely and adequate way,\" Morgan-Kurtz says. Gregory Dober, a medical ethicist at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Bioethics and Health Law, is quick to point out that jail medical malpractice charges under the constitution are incredibly rare, and for a prosecutor to claim deliberate indifference requires them to prove that the risk of harm was objectively serious and that the facility was acting recklessly. Still, Dober notes that the cases at the jail \"may be a constitutional violation\" and agrees with Morgan-Kurtz that the Allegheny County Jail is \"absolutely the worst\" jail in Pennsylvania in terms of healthcare. Geleynse said the jail has no comment on Dober’s and Morgan-Kurtz’s claims. Four of the six people who died while in custody at the jail in 2022 died due to medical reasons, according to a database created by PennLive and the Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism. Allegheny County was the only county in the state where the majority of in-jail deaths were due to medical reasons and not suicide. Frank Smart Jr. arrived at the jail in 2015 with a twice-daily script for anti-seizure medication. He died 48 hours later, according to a $950,000 settlement the county reached in 2018 with Smart's children. Smart never received his medication on his first day at the jail, resulting in a seizure, the suit alleged. Instead of rendering care, the responding officers handcuffed Smart and pushed him to the ground, where he was held for 30 minutes until he died, according to the suit. Early last year, Denzel Kendrick, another inmate who has multiple illnesses, including sickle cell disease, had a stroke after the jail refused him necessary medication for two months, according to a letter from the Abolitionist Law Center, a public interest firm, to the County Law Department in January 2023. Aaron Tipton, a current inmate at the jail, filed a lawsuit on Feb. 7 alleging that guards at the jail broke his arm and threw him in solitary confinement in September of last year after he complained he wasn't receiving his prescribed pain medication for neuropathy. click to enlarge CP PHOTO: Mars Johnson Former Allegheny County Jail inmate Terry Fluker looks out over the Monongahela River. Fluker, who, since leaving the jail, is continuing to devote part of his life to HIV/AIDS advocacy, says that in jail, people are striving for a routine they can take with them back to society. For those with medical conditions, consistent medication is necessary for their rehabilitation. \"In that type of environment, people are trying to get back on track, to get their life — get on their meds or whatnot,\" Fluker says. \"Not having that support can be a struggle and frustrating.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Social Justice, Sarah McBeth, Allies for Health + Wellbeing, Allegheny County Jail, Jesse Geleynse, Muhammad Ali Nasir, Allegheny County Jail Oversight Board, Alexandra Morgan-Kurtz, Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, Gregory Dober, University of Pittsburgh Center for Bioethics and Health Law, PennLive, Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism, Abolitionist Law Center Related Content Pittsburgh’s 2025 budget draws down police staffing and increases social services By Matt Petras Jan 8, 2025 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, Cancer Bridges, PPG Paints Arena, and more By Morgan Biddle Jul 15, 2024 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Pie Guy Pie Crew, Lifeguards, Outpatient Therapist, and more By Morgan Biddle Mar 25, 2024 A consent order brings the Allegheny County Jail close to wide-reaching mental healthcare changes By James Paul Mar 19, 2024 Latest in Social Justice After setbacks, Not on Our Dime is trying again to get divestment from Israel on the ballot By Rachel Wilkinson Feb 25, 2025 Feyisola Akintola is on a mission to make Pittsburgh more welcoming By Aakanksha Agarwal Feb 24, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 As ICE detains locals, dozens of businesses join A Day Without Immigrants By Colin Williams Feb 3, 2025 More » More Social Justice All News Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 11 images Breaking ground for a new music venue in the Lower Hill District By Mars Johnson Mar 13, 2025 Trending It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Will the real John Fetterman please stand up?

But more than two years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade and stripped the federal constitutional right to abortion, legal advocacy organizations and activists have already been fighting to uphold laws in state courts, often characterized as the new frontline for abortion access. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Pittsburgh City Paper is reviewing Pennsylvania’s current political landscape and its impact on abortion and reproductive rights. The battle runs through a Pittsburgh reproductive health clinic, a landmark Pennsylvania Supreme Court case, and an upcoming judicial election. Greer Donley, an attorney, abortion law expert, law professor and associate dean at the University of Pittsburgh, describes the situation in Pennsylvania as “a little bit perplexing.” In the aftermath of Dobbs, most states can preserve a legal right to abortion either through a state law or by deriving the right from the state’s constitution. In Pennsylvania, the Abortion Control Act, a law passed in 1982, makes abortion legal at up to 24 weeks of pregnancy (tied to the concept of fetal “viability” introduced under Roe, with some exceptions for life-threatening circumstances). However, as its name suggests, the law comes with a number of restrictions. These include a 24-hour waiting period, state-mandated counseling, a parental consent requirement for minors, and a ban on Medicaid funds covering abortions (with very limited exceptions). The Pennsylvania legislature could also further restrict or outright ban abortion if an anti-abortion governor were to take office. A “stronger” way to enshrine the right is through the Pennsylvania Constitution, Donley explains. This is where complications arise because “we don't actually have a state court opinion that says there is a right to abortion in the Pennsylvania Constitution yet.” click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost But an influential case last January might break new ground. Allegheny Reproductive Health v. Pennsylvania Department of Human Services challenged the state’s ban on Medicaid-funded abortions under the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. While the battle to add the ERA to the U.S. Constitution has been ongoing for more than a century, about half of states have adopted it in their constitutions in some form, including Pennsylvania in 1971. “[In Pennsylvania,] we have our own constitution that predated the federal constitution, is better than the federal constitution, is independent of the federal constitution, and that has been extremely underdeveloped over the eons,” Sue Frietsche, executive director of the Women’s Law Project said at a recent post-Dobbs panel at Pitt’s Law School. In 2019, Pa.-based Women’s Law Project (where Donley also serves as board chair), Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and law firm Troutman Pepper first brought the case to the state Supreme Court on behalf of clinics including Pittsburgh’s Allegheny Reproductive Health Center. After a five-year course of litigation, they successfully argued the state’s Medicaid program refusing to cover abortion is sex discrimination, overturning nearly 40 years of precedent and paving the way for future rulings affirming abortion rights. “When you’re looking at abortion restrictions, they are presumptively sex discriminatory,” Donley tells City Paper. “And so that really opens the door to strike down many of the abortion laws in Pennsylvania that restrict abortion access.” The case also marked the first time a state Supreme Court decision impacted abortion rights after Dobbs, paving a new way to protect reproductive rights through state-level Equal Rights Amendments. “So there is a really encouraging path forward,” Frietsche said. “We are also asking the court to acknowledge that the state constitution guarantees a right to reproductive autonomy and protects it as a fundamental right, so stronger than anything we had under Roe. But we will need all kinds of citizen activism at both the federal and the state level to protect the gains that we are only just now starting to see at the state level in Pennsylvania.” The ruling could still be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court or amended via Pennsylvania’s Constitution, which is more subject to political headwinds. click to enlarge CP Illustration: Jeff Schreckengost Additionally, some experts, including Jessica Valenti, the journalist behind the Abortion Every Day Substack, suggest that a nationwide ban could overturn all state protections, making Pennsylvania's ruling vulnerable to federal laws as well. Still, state protections at least lay groundwork for battling that ban in court. Unlike other states, the justices that make up Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court are selected for 10-year terms through partisan elections (as opposed to nonpartisan elections or appointment). Currently, the seven-member court maintains a 5-2 Democratic majority, and as long as this holds, “a majority of justices seemed to endorse the view” there is a state constitutional right to abortion, Donley says. In 2025, three Democratic justices on the state’s Supreme Court face reelection. Justices Christine Donohue, David Wecht, and Kevin Dougherty — all of whom affirmed the state’s ban on Medicaid-funded abortion was sex discrimination — will run for retention this fall. As WESA recently reported, while judicial races typically receive little attention and garner low voter turnout, the possibility of ending the state Supreme Court’s Democratic majority could make for an ugly political battle. Donley noted that, when it comes to protecting abortion rights, the judicial retention races could receive additional scrutiny, as Pennsylvania does not allow for statewide referendums or ballot measures like other states have introduced after Dobbs. “When people are voting in Pennsylvania for Supreme Court justices [this year], abortion is more than ever before on the ballot,” she tells CP.

Democrats sound the alarm on abortion on Roe's 51st anniversary By Colin Williams click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato speaks to the media at a press conference on abortion rights Pennsylvania Democrats held a press conference Monday afternoon at the Pittsburgh City-County Building on what would've been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. All four speakers during the presser sounded the alarm on growing momentum behind Republican efforts to ban abortion. The explicit purpose of the gathering was to preemptively oppose any forthcoming federal abortion ban efforts under former President and Republican frontrunner for renomination Donald Trump. Though the likely nominee says he's for some exceptions to total bans on the procedure, he has also heavily touted the reversal of Roe during his first term in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Trump allies in states across the country have used the decision as a pretext to ban and restrict abortion at the state level — and to seek the prosecution of people who terminate their pregnancies. The assembled Democrats said a second Trump presidency would exacerbate this already-tenuous situation. \"We are standing here today 51 years after the Supreme Court issued its Roe v. Wade decision,\" U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (Pa.-12) said. \"Today, 51 years later, we have less rights than our mothers.\" Following Lee, Pa. Rep. Jessica Benham, Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, and abortion advocate Kelsey Leigh shared their own warnings, threading together the personal and political implications of continued access to reproductive healthcare. \"As someone with a genetic condition that makes pregnancy very dangerous and complicated … if I got pregnant, it would likely be a high-risk pregnancy,\" Benham told Pittsburgh City Paper and other members of the media in the City-County Building's portico. \"As we are now seeing, women on their literal deathbed are watching doctors wait for lawyers to finish arguing about whether or not to make an exception [to a given state's ban].\" Leigh spoke of her difficult choice to get an abortion after discovering her fetus had multiple life-threatening abnormalities. Leigh said she's since had the opportunity to share her story with state and national lawmakers as well as volunteer at a local clinic, giving her a sense of community and reminding her why access to abortion is so important, especially as neighboring states including Ohio and West Virginia have sought to curtail abortion rights. \"People are traveling far distances and wading through a cesspool of misinformation,\" Leigh said, \"and so, while the Dobbs decision was and is still devastating, it only pulled back the curtain on the inequities that have existed for a very long time.\" Lee noted that these inequities have manifested in high infant and maternal mortality in Pittsburgh, while Benham noted the way LGBTQ communities have lacked access to reproductive care. Both lawmakers said well-funded crisis pregnancy centers have exacerbated these issues despite losing state funding. Benham indicated that \"there's been some discussion around actions the county council and the county executive's office can potentially take.\" \"At the federal level, we are still seeing really unfortunate attempts to legitimize crisis pregnancy centers,\" Lee told City Paper. \"Just this last week at the federal level, we had the Republican caucus try to advance a bill that was under the misleading title of Pregnant Students Rights [Act].\" The group advocated for defeating Republican candidates up and down the ballot, especially given the impact gerrymandering has had on passing legislation. \"I know from my years in Harrisburg that Republicans will stop at nothing to restrict our right to access abortion care and our overall reproductive rights,\" Innamorato said. She deplored the way women like her were being forced to publicly reckon with a \"private, personal decision.\" \"We need leaders at every level committed to protecting abortion access,\" she said, \"now more than ever.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Abortion, Roe v.

It wasn’t to make an appointment—it was to bring over food. “I'm Italian and I'm a mom so, you know, I love feeding people,” Sofia tells Pittsburgh City Paper. (*Several sources requested that City Paper use only their first names to protect anonymity). Pittsburgh’s abortion organizing network is intergenerational and community-led — it consists of old and young volunteers, advocates, parents, educators, and artists. These supporters relieve some of the burdens for abortion clinic staff and allow them to focus on patient care. Cooking was a way Sofia found she could support clinics. She'd occasionally drop off soup and even taught her Girl Scout troop how to bake homemade bread for the staff. “It doesn't have to be a big, glamorous way that you help out — every little thing that people do is helping,” she says. But during this particular call, the Director of Abortion Care told Sofia they needed volunteers. ARHC, one of only two abortion clinics in the region, was facing an influx of patients from across Pennsylvania and surrounding states. They asked for help to answer phones. Sofia contacted a group she had met at a recent protest — the Abortion Defense Committee. The first few weeks were chaos as they tried to meet the clinic’s needs. “We started organizing volunteers, and it was just all these moving parts,” she says. Eventually, they were able to find a rhythm, arrange shifts, and create a process for community members who wanted to volunteer. Her food delivery didn’t stop, either — over the past year and a half, she’s asked local cafes and restaurants to donate coffee and lunches to ARHC and Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania. Sofia says that food is a way to care for people and a type of volunteering that means a lot to her. “It’s a little highlight in someone’s day,” Sofia says. “We were already talking, before Roe fell, about sustainability as activists, and it’s really important that we are doing volunteer work that we can actually sustain, and that is healthy for us, so that we can stay in it.” That looks different for everyone. Beth, a local writer and artist, also got involved with Abortion Defense Committee the weekend that Roe fell. “One of my neighbors, an ADC member, recruited me to volunteer answering phones, and I’ve been at the clinic since,” Beth tells CP. At first, Beth just took down names and numbers as fast as possible to provide relief to intake staff. But as the amount of calls slowed, she had more moments to connect with the people calling. “Now, I take more time with people who call with questions about abortion or want to tell their story,” she says. “Even if a call lasts just a few minutes, it's a sojourn, a chance for the caller to have nonjudgmental listening.” Beth enjoys this kind of work so much that, over the summer, Beth started volunteering with a talkline for people struggling with pregnancy, abortion, adoption, and parenting. “Now I work as an advocate on that line as well as at the clinic,” she shares. Abortion Defense Committee formed in late 2021 to canvass neighborhoods and spread awareness about crisis pregnancy centers, which they call \"fake abortion clinics.\" Soon after, they focused on the Dobbs v. Jackson case and began a demonstration movement to fight for Roe and reproductive justice for Black and brown people. The committee has planned rallies, healing circles, and storytelling events for individuals to share their experiences with abortion, family planning, assault, and other issues. Sofia says that storytelling is a beautiful aspect of reproductive advocacy. click to enlarge “If you’re ready to tell your story, it will help somebody,” she says. “Something that storytelling brought up was that I always feel that I'm either too much or that I'm not enough. And I think a lot of people who've been through trauma have this in common.” ADC collaborates with other local organizations such as Food Not Bombs and the Black Liberation Autonomous Collective to provide mutual aid. They also partner with Radical Reuse to sell wearable pro-abortion art that benefits regional abortion funds. Since the Dobbs decision, the group has become part of a larger organizing network supporting abortion access. Planned Parenthood Generation Action, a group of University of Pittsburgh students, makes care packages for patients and abortion providers. Steel City Access Network works with clinics to provide rides to appointments, and Western PA Fund for Choice collects donations to cover the costs of abortion. Some of the younger members of ADC have gone on to form the Pittsburgh Abortion Access Network, dedicated to helping college students access reproductive care by directly providing contraception and local resources. Katie Emmert, a PAAN co-founder and junior at the University of Pittsburgh, says the group is necessary because most college students are new to navigating healthcare on their own. “PAAN hopes to make the process of connecting to providers much easier, and to empower students with the tools they need to comfortably seek services themselves,” she tells CP. Local clinic staff say they’ve been overwhelmed by the community’s efforts. “The outpouring of support since Dobbs has been incredible,” Allegheny Reproductive employee Noah Thompson tells CP. Thompson describes the past year and a half as “unpredictable.” “Since the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, multiple states have fallen in and out of abortion limbo,” they share. “As a result, our patient load is constantly changing.” Most of the clinic’s volunteers field phone calls, some help with medical intake, and others sit with post-procedure patients. “Many of us are physically and emotionally exhausted, but we are committed to providing the best care we can in this tumultuous time — it’s more important now than ever,” Thompson says. Although Thompson calls Pittsburgh a “reproductive haven” compared to other cities, they argue that there are still significant barriers to access, citing misinformation and CPCs, LGBTQIA+ care, and Black maternal mortality rates. “Pittsburgh certainly has a lot of work to do when it comes to reproductive justice.” Sofia agrees that there is more to be done, and believes it can be achieved by working together. She says organizing networks not only show up for clinics and patients — they show up for each other. When Sofia had surgery, friends from ADC checked in and even sent her Doordash. “The relationships you form as an organizer are amazing, and I’m so grateful for this community,” she says. “We’re in it for the long haul.” To volunteer at a clinic, email [email protected].

Many of us can relate to what Amanda Seales describes in her 2019 comedy special I Be Knowin’ — “I just spent the last 20 minutes in a public bathroom fashioning a makeshift maxi pad out of a long-ass CVS receipt.” But the reality of access to menstrual care basics is, in reality, far more serious. According to a national study, one in five teens has struggled to afford period products. Period poverty — or a lack of access to menstrual hygiene resources and education — affects many people, but BIPOC individuals, as well as incarcerated and unhoused individuals are disproportionately affected. Pittsburgh City Paper sat down with Tamara Abney, founder of SisterFriend, an organization that fights period poverty, to talk about the lack of public access to menstrual products. She says menstrual equity is often not on people’s minds, which means it gets overlooked in budgets. “You know, a lot of people, whenever I tell them about my organization, they kind of have an ‘aha’ moment,” she shares. “Even though I may be talking to a menstruating person, they're like, ‘Oh, I didn't realize that was an issue!’ So I think [it requires] stripping away a layer of privilege that some of us do have.” SisterFriend was founded in 2015 to get pads and tampons to low-income individuals. They distribute menstrual and hygiene products to public schools, shelters, correctional facilities, and organizations across the county. Abney doesn’t understand why people should have to pay for pads or tampons when they're in public spaces. “You know, it's almost like they're saying. It's your problem that you menstruate, so you figure it out,” she says. “Like, is it my problem that I urinate? Is it my problem that I have to wash my hands? Bathrooms provide toilet paper, they provide paper towels and soap.” In 2022, the menstrual product brand Always name Abney the Period Hero for the state of Pennsylvania, and SisterFriend received 50,000 pads from the company. After they finish distributing those, Abney says the organization will be transitioning to focus entirely on menstrual equity education. The SisterFriend website will become home to consolidated resources, so people know where to find menstrual products and services, and can learn how to advocate for budget allocations in their communities and schools. The website will also contain informational videos for young people starting their periods, and guides for parents who want to have conversations about menstruation. Abney says the more that people talk about periods, the faster change will come. “As long as we won't say the words, as long as we're uncomfortable, then we'll continue to not pay attention to it,” she says. “So we should start talking about it, especially when a high percentage of the population has a period every month.” In Pittsburgh, there isn’t just a lack of free tampons and pads, there’s a lack of public bathrooms.

It’s about resistance. And it’s about legacy. From the radical healthcare initiatives of the Black Panther Party to today’s Black-led mental health programs, yoga collectives, and community spaces, Black Pittsburghers have continually forged paths to healing. As these wellness movements continue to grow, they reinforce the belief that care is not a privilege but a right. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dr. John Wallace Jr. and Cynthia Wallace Local leaders at the heart of this movement recognize that healing must be holistic and culturally rooted to thrive. Brittany Steiner, a licensed professional counselor at the Counseling and Wellness Center of Pittsburgh, sees therapy as an act of defiance in a community where seeking professional help has often been stigmatized. “I sometimes see a resistance to self-care in the Black community because it is perceived as a luxury versus a necessity,” Steiner tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “This is likely in part due to the way it is commercialized in mainstream media but can also be reflective of self-worth.”​ Her perspective is part of a more significant trend that’s been unfolding for decades. While the general act of self-care today is often commercialized, its roots are radical. As Teen Vogue highlights, the Black Panther Party saw healthcare as a human right, launching free health clinics, food programs, and mental health initiatives to combat the racist healthcare system. In Pittsburgh, the presence of the BBP was relatively low. Still, its influence inspired local activists to push for Black-led healthcare initiatives, feeding the larger Black Power movement that was active in the city during the late 1960s, addressing police brutality, food insecurity, and medical disparities that disproportionately affected Black residents. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Counseling and Wellness Center of Pittsburgh Brittany Steiner That legacy continues today through Black mental health professionals and community healing spaces prioritizing culturally relevant care. Recently, Steiner has seen a shift in how Black Pittsburghers approach therapy. “The demand [for Black therapists] has certainly increased,” she says. “I also notice specific spaces for healing in the community from Black therapy providers in Pittsburgh and educational spaces specifically for BIPOC mental health providers on a national level.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dr. John Wallace Jr. and Cynthia Wallace click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Bible Center Church in Homewood. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Pastors Cynthia and John Wallace Jr. sit in the conference room of Own Our Own in Homewood on Feb. 16, 2024. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain. Some of the most common diagnoses Steiner sees in the Black community are those of trauma and PTSD, marital/relational issues, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression — often linked to systemic problems such as gentrification, police violence, and economic inequality. Therapy can be a crucial tool, but Steiner emphasizes that healing must also be communal. She incorporates community-based healing into her work by offering somatic release workshops, where participants process trauma through breathwork, meditation, and movement​. Faith and spirituality also play critical roles in Black healing. Steiner notes that more Black Pittsburghers embrace a dual approach, saying, “‘I can talk to God and go to therapy. I say ‘Amen’ to that, and I would add taking psychiatric medication to that.” “My first ideas of healing involved taking everything to God and the church without addressing mental health,” Steiner says. “From the time I was a little girl, my mom would always say, and often [still] does, ‘You can’t just lay on the train tracks and pray you won’t get run over.’ We have to pray and do some other things and that may include therapy and medication.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dr. John Wallace Jr. and Cynthia Wallace visit the Oasis Farm and Fishery in Homewood. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Cynthia Wallace stands in the Oasis Community Kitchen in Homewood on Fe. 16, 2024. Everyday Cafe, a church-run social enterprise in Homestead, exemplifies this approach. Founded by Dr. John M. Wallace Jr. and his wife, Cynthia, both pastors, the cafe is an extension of Bible Center Church’s mission to uplift the Homewood community. “We believe wellness encompasses the whole person — body, mind, and spirit,” Dr. Wallace tells City Paper. “Our cafe serves as more than just a place for quality food and beverages; we strive to be a sanctuary where our community can gather, connect, and be nurtured holistically through the power of food and fellowship.” Everyday Cafe hosts pop-up markets for Black businesses, breast cancer awareness programs, and local wellness collaborations, ensuring that healing remains accessible to all​. They also offer nutritious meals, wellness initiatives, and community-building events. Additionally, through Own Our Own Entrepreneurship Academy and Business Development Center, the cafe fosters economic empowerment by mentoring Black entrepreneurs and providing resources for business growth​. Dr. Wallace, a social scientist, envisioned Everyday Cafe as a “third space” for members of the Homewood community. He explains that the term refers to a place that is neither home nor work but a hub where residents, business leaders, and activists can gather and build relationships. Through its connection to Bible Center Church, the restaurant also integrates faith-based wellness with tangible resources, from financial literacy workshops to health fairs, and allows for the addressing of mental, physical, and spiritual well-being, ensuring that Pittsburgh’s Black residents have a holistic wellness space rooted in both cultural and religious traditions. On the body movement side of wellness, YogaRoots On Location, founded by Felicia Savage Friedman, brings trauma-informed yoga with a racial justice lens to Pittsburgh’s Black community. “My self-care living practice is an act of resistance against a system that does not value my life,” Friedman tells CP. “YROL is my private and public commitment to my survival and thrive in this life, in this arrangement of intersectional oppressions. Yes, my breath is radical resistance.” Friedman traces her practice back more than 35 years, first learning Raja Yoga from a Black woman in Pittsburgh. From there, she built a teaching practice that expanded throughout the city, bringing yoga to the Healthy Black Family Project, local jails, and various community spaces​. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dr. John Wallace Jr. and Cynthia Wallace walk through Homewood on Feb. 16, 2024. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Oasis Farm and Fishery in Homewood Her curriculum incorporates social justice principles, mindfulness, and movement, letting yoga serve as a tool for Black liberation. She sees her work as a natural continuation of the Black Panther Party’s legacy of community health initiatives. “YogaRoots On Location aligns with The Black Panther Party’s 10-point plan for Black people,” she says. “However, YROL extends the 10-point plan to include all humans who want to live in harmony with all people.” While Pittsburgh’s Black communities continue to navigate systemic healthcare inequities, grassroots movements are reclaiming self-care as a revolutionary act, not just as a trend, but as a transformative force for future generations. “Practicing my agency and being as healthy as possible is my birthright,” says Friedman.​ click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Dr. John Wallace Jr. and Cynthia Wallace Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Health, Counseling and Wellness Center of Pittsburgh, Brittany Steiner, Teen Vogue, Black Panther Party, Everyday Cafe, Bible Center Church, YogaRoots On Location, Felicia Savage Friedman Related Content Pastors John and Cynthia Wallace want to make Homewood an \"Oasis\" for locals By Maia Williams Feb 19, 2024 Black-led Community Spotlight: Felicia Savage Friedman of YogaRoots On Location By Dani Janae Apr 28, 2021 Latest in Health Norovirus is surging.

Hamilton goes by Jamie JeTaime on her popular Instagram account, where she directs, styles, and posts images of herself wearing stylish outfits and swimwear to her over 49,000 followers. She attributes much of this change to the body-positivity movement — or BoPo for short — a growing social push that seeks to challenge and change societal standards of beauty and wellness. While its history can be traced as far back as the 1960s, the movement has gained major traction over the past several years on social media. Hamilton represents one person bringing the movement to Pittsburgh, along with local fitness, dietary, and yoga specialists trying to undo the mental and physical harm inflicted by a culture that leaves little room for anyone who doesn’t fit a certain slim, athletic, and predominantly white image. They believe confronting this culture with direct action and body positivity can move the Pittsburgh region into a more inclusive future. Addressing this bias includes seeing more body types in media. “It’s hard to feel good about your body when you don’t see it anywhere,” says Hamilton, who, besides identifying as plus-size, is also taller than the average woman at 5 feet 10 inches. click to enlarge Photo: Jamie Hamilton and Kevin Deel Jamie Hamilton (fourth from left) and attendees of a Yinz Bopo meet up She believes BoPo also means respecting peoples’ bodies for what they are, not “some kind of preconceived notion of what bodies should be.” And, as research shows, lack of acceptance can have major consequences. Studies from the International Journal of Obesity and the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance have noted the prevalence of weight discrimination in the workplace, health care, and education, to the point where cities across the United States have had to outlaw the practice. Hamilton says that, to some degree, the fashion industry has taken note. “I’m seeing more clothing companies and brands and designers wanting to expand their size ranges or have more inclusive fits,” she says, adding that she has worked with Nike, ModCloth, Almay, and Dove, among others. But while Hamilton embodies the BoPo movement in her own work, she wanted to do more to spread that message and empower others. To do that, the Western Pennsylvania native created Yinz Bopo, an inclusive body-positive Pittsburgh Facebook group where people can go to feel comfortable, regardless of their abilities or what they look like. “Think about all the things we could be doing with our lives if we weren’t always wondering what’s wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with us.” tweet this Hamilton says one of the reasons she started the group was to bring to Pittsburgh the BoPo swimming meet-ups she saw going on in other cities. So far, the group has hosted pool meet-ups at various public pools and at Sandcastle Water Park in West Homestead. Hamilton says the outings mean a lot to group members who have long felt uncomfortable with their bodies. “For a lot of people, it’s their first time as an adult in a swimsuit ever,” she says. She also believes it’s important for others to see people who look different or have different abilities “hanging out and having fun.” “I wanted it to be a visual representation, to kind of change the way people think about bodies in general,” says Hamilton. Since it launched in June 2018, the group has attracted more than 430 followers. While Hamilton moved to Tucson, Ariz. in April, she says the group has kept going thanks to the efforts of her fellow page administrators and the members who often reach out to each other for advice and support. “We have so much power, and I truly believe that the world could change more if people just stopped hating what they looked like and stopped putting their energy toward telling somebody else that they look wrong,” she says. “Think about all the things we could be doing with our lives if we weren’t always wondering what’s wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with us.” click to enlarge Photo: Jason Waltenbaugh Haley Goodrich and Kaley Sechman of INSPIRD Nutrition Hamilton has also experienced the bias of basing a person’s health or ability on their weight or appearance, primarily as a runner. “People wouldn’t expect plus-size people to be doing that,” she says, adding that she’s currently training for a 10K. INSPIRD Nutrition in Monroeville has been working against the long-held stigma attached to certain body types, as the desire to be thin and “healthy” often drives the development of eating disorders or, at the very least, an unhealthy, inflexible relationship with food. Run by Haley Goodrich and Kaley Sechman, INSPIRD Nutrition takes what is described as a “weight-inclusive approach” by not measuring healthiness based on weight and helping clients develop sustainable choices by rejecting harmful, restrictive diets. “A lot of times, people have been dieting for years, decades sometimes, and are just tired of cycling through dieting, and just feeling bad about themselves and their bodies, and kind of waiting for their body to change to live their lives,” says Sechman, a registered dietitian. “That’s definitely something I hear often.” While restrictive dieting fads come and go, studies and many people’s life experiences have shown that they do little to help people achieve the “perfect body.” The National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) recognizes body image as a major motivation behind restrictive eating and estimates that over 30 million Americans struggle with an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Over the years, countless studies and surveys have found that restrictive, weight-loss dieting simply doesn’t work — one 2007 report from UCLA even stated that, while dieters typically lose five to 10 percent of their starting weight in the first six months, a vast majority end up regaining more weight than they lost after they return to their usual routine. “It’s hard to feel good about your body when you don’t see it anywhere.\" tweet this Sechman says one way INSPIRD hopes to help people is by defining food “neutrally, as opposed to good versus bad,” in effect combating the practice of food-shaming inherent to dieting. “Making those moral attachments has some pretty strong negative repercussions,” says Sechman. “We’re working to remove that which is really difficult to do, especially since the culture feeds those messages all the time of ‘good versus bad,’ and, ‘if you eat the good foods, you’re good and superior; if you eat the bad foods, you’re bad and clearly don’t care about yourself,’ and all of the subtext that goes with that.” To do this, Sechman adopted Health At Every Size, a set of principles created by the Association for Size Diversity and Health, and Intuitive Eating, an anti-dieting approach, after becoming disillusioned with the way she was taught to treat patients. “Like most of us in health care, we’re trained in the weight-centered paradigm, which is a traditional health care model that focuses on weight as a proxy for health and wellbeing,” she says. “I started thinking critically about, ‘Why are things like this, and why am I not feeling secure in my job, why am I feeling like I’m not helping people?’” Now she and Goodrich take a therapeutic approach based on trying to undo decades of toxic thinking around food and body image. “Most of [our clients] are looking for a way to feel better, and by that, I don’t just mean physically, but mentally,” says Sechman. “I think a lot of people are coming in just wanting to be heard and listened to … Sometimes I think that’s what people are looking for, just a space where they can feel safe to explore these things without feeling judged or shamed or pressured to feel like they have to change their body.” click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham Emily Anderson of All Bodies Welcome Yoga Through her work, Emily Anderson demonstrates that you don't have to change your body in order to teach yoga. After becoming a certified yoga instructor in June 2018, she founded All Bodies Welcome Yoga and has worked to make yoga more accessible and inclusive by teaching at locations throughout Pittsburgh. “Everyone has body insecurities, everyone feels weird about their body, but there are marginalized groups that have actual barriers to their health and wellness,” she says, “and that commitment to making those marginalized groups feel comfortable and feel safe takes a lot of insight and a lot of work.” Her mission reflects a problem in a fitness culture that can be intimidating, where personal trainers have been called out for body-shaming clients. Even when gyms or other fitness spaces claim they are open to everyone, the images they project say otherwise. To help combat this, Anderson adheres to a more radical version of the BoPo movement. “I think that people are just looking to see themselves represented in fitness spaces more and more.” tweet this “To me, the body-positive movement is really rooted in fat activism and body politics,” says Anderson, adding that she feels comfortable identifying as fat. “There are definitely a lot of brands and businesses wanting to promote self-love and self-acceptance, but they don’t necessarily have that same radical commitment to accessibility.” This includes diverting from the one-size-fits-all idea of yoga as something reserved for a select few. Anderson recalls taking yoga classes in which instructors would physically try to make her body move in ways that were not possible. “They don’t understand that it’s just because my body is larger than theirs is,” she says. “I have more bits than they do. So, that transition from how bodies look to how bodies are moving and feeling is important.” She would like to see the Pittsburgh yoga community work on being more inclusive by adapting to accommodate all students and trying to make it more accessible to wheelchair users and people who are differently abled. She believes they should also create a culture that includes a more diverse array of instructors. “I think that people are just looking to see themselves represented in fitness spaces more and more,” says Anderson. click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Murphy Felicia Savage Friedman teaches a chair yoga class at The Kingsley Association. Like Anderson, Felicia Savage Friedman, founder and CEO of YogaRoots on Location, has worked to expand representation in Pittsburgh’s yoga scene and beyond. Friedman, a certified yoga instructor with 24 years of experience, teaches a variety of yoga classes at the Kingsley Association and Ace Hotel. She also developed a Certified Rāja Yoga Teacher Training program with an anti-racist and social-justice framework. “It’s just how I navigate racism, capitalism, and sexism and patriarchy, and still wake up with joy, because it’s an all-out assault on my personhood,” says Friedman. “As a Black woman, I’m very much aware that the value of my life is close to nil in this society, so part of my practice as a Rāja yoga practitioner is that I stay as positive as I can, but I hold myself to standards of humanity every day, and Rāja yoga practice has been awesome for me as a way to do that.” In addition to learning physical and Rāja yoga, the 200-hour, year-long teacher training course includes exploring various social-justice topics through the Undoing Racism principles of the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond, a national and international collective dedicated to building an “effective movement for social transformation.” Since launching the program in 2016, Friedman has graduated 55 yogis, some of whom have gone on to teach her regular classes. The success of the program has enabled Friedman to take it beyond Pittsburgh, including to Greensboro, N.C., in October. She’s also looking to do trainings in cities like Brooklyn, Cleveland, and Seattle. As part of the anti-capitalist component of her approach, her yoga classes are free or low-cost, and she offers scholarships and other financial aid to those unable to afford the training program. She believes that she’s “actively changing” the yoga landscape by bringing in people of color, LGBTQ people, and others who thought they could never be yoga teachers because they didn’t fit the stereotypical yoga image. “It’s been wonderful to bring in marginalized groups and students of color, and they’re going out and teaching, and opening yoga studios themselves,” she says, adding that she’s not trying to create “mini-Felicias,” but wants to give students the tools to teach from their own experiences. “I feel really honored.” click to enlarge CP photo: Jared Wickerham Erica Gadelmeyer, director of operations at the North Side YMCA, does a squat balance workout with Abby Cook during her War Streets Crossfit class. Anderson and Friedman aren’t the only ones shaping the future of Pittsburgh’s wellness culture for the better. Erica Gadelmeyer, the director of operations and healthy living at the Allegheny YMCA and the head coach at CrossFit War Streets, has set out to help make all YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh Association facilities more explicitly welcoming. This includes adding gender-neutral restrooms and locker rooms. She says the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh Association is also working with the local LGBTQ services nonprofit, the Persad Center, to conduct audits that will make facilities more inclusive. She expects Persad to present its findings at a YMCA staff town hall meeting next year. “I think it’s really important to communicate that out [loud] to people and let your population know that these are the steps we’re taking,” says Gadelmeyer. “To put action behind those words and show that you’re working toward that really goes a long way.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags News, Pittsburgh BoPo, Yinz Bopo, bopo, body positivity Related Content Pittsburgh Underwear Bike Ride promotes body positivity By Thria Devlin Aug 2, 2017 Latest in News Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

Here's what you can do to stay healthy By Katy Fleming click to enlarge Stock From schools to nursing homes, norovirus cases have surged to record numbers this winter, with over 90 outbreaks reported in early December alone. This highly contagious “stomach flu” spreads rapidly, causing stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Yet, in today’s digital age, misinformation about its prevention and treatment often spreads even faster than the virus itself. Did you know, for example, that hand sanitizers are largely ineffective against norovirus? Here’s what you need to know to stay protected. Norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, nausea, and diarrhea in the United States, triggers inflammation in the stomach and intestines. Symptoms often appear suddenly and typically last one to three days. Dr. Graham Snyder, Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology at UPMC, offers insights into the treatment and prevention of the norovirus. “Norovirus is highly contagious, with an ability to survive on surfaces very well and only a small number of viruses needed to cause illness. It is spread by either eating food contaminated by the unclean hands of a person preparing the food or by using your hands to eat after touching a contaminated surface. That is why hand hygiene is the most important way to prevent the spread of norovirus,” he says. In addition to eating contaminated food, the virus spreads through touching infected surfaces and then touching your mouth. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains why norovirus spreads so easily and widely. Norovirus is incredibly resilient — it can endure extreme temperatures, resist certain cleaning products, and remain contagious on surfaces for days or even weeks. Even after symptoms resolve, people can shed billions of virus particles in their stool for up to two weeks, continuing to spread the illness. Common food preparation methods, like quickly steaming shellfish, may not kill the virus. Those recovering from norovirus can unknowingly spread it to others by preparing food or sharing a bathroom before they’re fully free of the virus. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), norovirus accounts for over 450,000 Emergency Department (ED) visits annually. By age 5, 1 in 40 children will have visited an emergency room due to norovirus. “The most important threat of illness with norovirus is dehydration,” Snyder notes. “Young children, older adults, and people with other medical conditions are at the highest risk of complications. Dehydration can result in dry mouth, dizziness when standing, and decreased urine. Seek medical attention if you cannot keep up with replacing fluids or symptoms that last more than 3 days.” click to enlarge Graphic courtesy of NFID Rehydrating after vomiting and diarrhea is essential. Over-the-counter electrolyte solutions, like Pedialyte, are better than plain water for restoring fluids because they include important minerals your body loses. It’s best to avoid alcohol and caffeine, as they can dehydrate you further. Be cautious with sports drinks and fruit juices, as their high sugar content can worsen dehydration instead of helping. To curb the spread, experts recommend remaining home while you recover from norovirus until at least two days after symptoms resolve. Proper handwashing for at least 20 seconds with soap and water is critical, as hand sanitizers are largely ineffective against norovirus. Snyder says there are additional ways to protect yourself during norovirus outbreaks: “Cleaning potentially contaminated surfaces will reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Not all household products kill the virus, so be sure to check the label for the product instructions. Bleach-based products, including diluted chlorine bleach (5 to 25 tablespoons per gallon of water) are reliable for disinfecting surfaces. Wash contaminated laundry with detergent and hot water, with a hot dryer cycle (being sure to wash your hands after handling the laundry).” There’s no any specific medication to treat this virus, and antibiotics are not effective as they fight bacteria. Many types of the virus exist, and immunity is short-lived, so it’s possible to get sick from norovirus multiple times throughout your life. Unfortunately, a vaccine does not exist for norovirus, but Snyder reports that potential vaccines are currently in development. Although this virus affects any age, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk. If you’re experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, please stay home until at least two days after you feel better. Don’t cook food for anyone else and use a separate bathroom from others in your home, if possible. Whether you are ill or not, remember healthy hand hygiene — and don’t substitute with hand sanitizer. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, before and after preparing food, after changing diapers, after caring for people who are sick, after touching common surfaces, and after shaking hands with others. Norovirus is persistent, but you can stay a step ahead with proper prevention. Protect yourself and those around you by practicing effective handwashing, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and staying home while recovering. Sharing these tips with your community will help stop the spread of this highly contagious virus.

However, the high costs of gym memberships, health clubs, and nutritious food can derail these well-intended goals before they begin. Fortunately, the Pittsburgh community offers a variety of affordable options through local businesses, non-profit organizations, events, and apps to help you stay on track without breaking the bank. Ascend Southside, a climbing gym, hosts monthly “Big Free Yoga” sessions at their downstairs neighbor, Velum Fermentation. These completely free exercise classes range from yoga to boot camps in one-hour sessions each month. Be sure to sign up through Ascend’s scheduling portal on their website to reserve your spot. Another organization offering free events is Teetotal Initiative, a local non-profit offering inclusive sober-focused programming. Their upcoming events include a Reiki & Restore class on January 19th, featuring restorative yoga and Kundalini Reiki. Meeting health and wellness goals doesn’t require expensive equipment and memberships. Pittsburgh-native nutritionist, personal trainer, and registered nurse, Shelly Livingston encourages individuals to focus on creating a healthier lifestyle one step at a time. “Simply adjust small, everyday habits to something slightly healthier. Small changes over time lead to big goal success– like parking further away from the entrance of the grocery store to get more steps in, choosing to take the stairs over an escalator or elevator, and buying whole foods while eliminating packaged, processed foods,” says Livingston. Accountability can make implementing these changes easier. Various exercise-focused groups provide socialization and support to help you stay on track. For instance, City Girls Who Walk Pittsburgh offers free walking sessions around the city to increase your step count while fostering friendships. Similarly, Yinz Run Club organizes fun, inclusive, and free weekly running sessions. Allegheny County resident David De Leon described his experience with Yinz Run Club (YRC): “I joined YRC in 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic. Running had become my go-to exercise during quarantine, and I figured joining a club would help me stay accountable while meeting new people. Clubs like YRC do exactly that, offering an inclusive, laid-back environment.” (You can find more free fitness, wellness, and social events in the Pittsburgh area on platforms such as Eventbrite.) If you prefer to stay home, several websites and apps provide free health and wellness content to support your New Year’s resolutions. For example, UPMC Health Plan’s RxWell app helps individuals build emotional and physical health. Available at no cost to UPMC Health Plan members ages 14 and up, the app offers personalized health coaching to improve habits such as healthy eating, physical activity, and stress management. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Climbers at Ascend Southside. The gym will offer Big Free Yoga classes at Velum Fermentation downstairs. For additional inspiration, podcasts like The Nutrition Science Podcast and TED Health offer science-backed insights into healthier living. Meanwhile, YouTube channels like Fit By Mik provide free strength and cardio workout routines. The Allegheny County Health Department’s Live Well Allegheny campaign promotes health and wellness with an online directory of resources for residents. The site also lists healthy living events throughout the year and provides guides for eating well and staying active on a budget. The rising cost of groceries and limited access to affordable, nutritious food can be significant barriers to better health. A study by PlushCare revealed that healthy foods cost over three times more than unhealthy options at Target stores in Pennsylvania. One resource addressing this challenge is the Giant Eagle Mobile Market, a traveling grocery store that brings over 700 items– including fresh produce at half price– to Pittsburgh communities with limited food access. The Mobile Market accepts SNAP, WIC, gift cards, and checks, making it accessible to many. Sometimes, the hardest part of making healthy changes is knowing where to begin. “Achieving your health and wellness goals doesn't require a large budget, just a mindset shift,” says Livingston. “Change is not going to be immediate. Be mindful of the choices made daily, as well as weighing whether they are moving you closer to or further from your set goal.” Experts recommend starting with one change—whether it’s joining a free fitness group, downloading an app like RxWell, or exploring the Giant Eagle Mobile Market for fresh, affordable produce. Remember, your journey is unique, and progress comes from everyday choices that align with your goals. Pursuing your health and wellness goals doesn’t have to be expensive or overwhelming. By taking small, consistent steps and tapping into the wealth of affordable resources Pittsburgh offers, you can create a sustainable path to a healthier lifestyle.

In 2022, fitness entrepreneur Brianna Joye Kohn posted a TikTok video asking if any women wanted to walk in Central Park. When 250 women arrived ready to walk, City Girls Who Walk formed. After witnessing this New York City-based walking group bloom on social media, CGWW Pittsburgh founder Fallon DeRiggi recognized the need for a social walking club for women in Pittsburgh. DeRiggi received permission from CGWW to start a new chapter, and City Girls Who Walk Pittsburgh began officially in May 2023. “It’s a group of women who may have different backgrounds and occupations, but we find a time once or twice a week to get together and just walk. It’s something that we can do for mental health, stress relief, or physical activity,” DeRiggi says. “No matter your reason for walking, you leave feeling awesome.” This group holds walking events once or twice a week, with 25 to 80 women participating depending on the day and weather. Each walk is approximately 2.5 miles long and lasts around 45 minutes. Everyone walks at their own pace, and the group encourages pets and strollers to join. The CGWW Pittsburgh leadership team maps the walk route beforehand to respect members’ time and schedules. All types of women are welcome in this walking group including non-binary, transwomen and cisgender individuals. DeRiggi explained, “Anyone who wants to get out of the house or is looking to connect with like-minded females should join us. It’s the one thing that women can have that’s ours.” Maintaining a solid group of friends can be challenging in adulthood. Whether someone is new to the area or looking for a way to connect with others, City Girls Who Walk welcomes them. “I needed a stable group of girls that I could rely on,” CGWW Pittsburgh member and leader Tira Clark says. “When I found CGWW on social media, my friends had moved out of state. I really enjoy this group, and that’s what it is for me — a stable group of friends.” click to enlarge Photo courtesy of City Girls Who Walk CGWW Pittsburgh during a winter walk In the first six months, DeRiggi ran the Pittsburgh chapter by herself with the help of a few friends to organize activities, manage social media accounts, and lead every weekly walk. As the group continued to expand, with new members joining every week, DeRiggi knew she needed a team. After posting a request for help on social media, 11 women stepped up to help run the Pittsburgh chapter. The City Girls have packed their schedule with activities as the weather warms up in Western Pennsylvania. Partnering with local organizations, CGWW Pittsburgh offers monthly events such as a yoga session at the Om Lounge after a walk through the Strip District. The group celebrated Easter with an organized egg hunt throughout the city, followed by brunch at Wigle Whiskey. Each month brings new activities to encourage physical fitness, fun, and fellowship. In addition to connecting with new friends over a brisk walk, City Girls Who Walk strives to impact the community positively. On May 18, the City Girls will walk for a cure at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s Great Strides fundraiser. CGWW Pittsburgh will also partner with Allegheny CleanWays and Friends of the Riverfront for a volunteer clean-up around the city this Earth Day. Those interested in City Girls Who Walk can learn more about upcoming walks and other events on Instagram. The City Girls remain connected through the Heylo app. CGWW Pittsburgh merch is also now available. There’s never a cost to walk, but some buy their fellow walkers a coffee or purchase items along the way. DeRiggi shared that the most frequently asked question about CGWW Pittsburgh is, “Can I come alone?” She says most girls arrive by themselves, but no one walks alone with the City Girls. The leadership team scatters throughout the spread-out group to chat and include all walkers. “You will not be walking alone; I assure you of that,” DeRiggi said.

Inglis may be a new name to many in Greater Pittsburgh, but it has been an established home care company for those with disabilities in Philadelphia for the last 100 years. Inglis is run by the indefatigable Leah Marmo. Marmo gave Pittsburgh City Paper a tour of its new office space complete with a fully accessible kitchenette, a 3D printing room, a conference room, and more. Marmo has been hard at work getting the center off the ground over the past year. She tells City Paper that they were looking to expand outside of the Philadelphia region when Highmark approached them. Highmark was impressed by their innovation space and interested in creating something similar in Pittsburgh. Inglis leadership along with Marmo (and her insights) wrote a grant proposal, and 15 months later, Marmo was able to bring the Innovation Center to Bellevue — conveniently for Marmo, the new location is walking distance from her home, she tells CP with a laugh. “The Innovation Center…that we opened is really the launching pad for two services that we offer right now. One of those services is our community-based assistive technology program, Inglis Assistive Tech Solutions (IATS), and the other program is called the Inglis Impact Accelerator,” Marmo explains. The community-based assistive technology program provides services such as creating custom-made assistive technology products for people in the region. In one instance, a community member, following a tour of the Center, connected her mother who lives with multiple sclerosis to the Center’s assistive tech programming. The program was able to provide custom 3D printed tools, such as a bottle opener and a holder for her phone, that supports the woman with her activities of daily living. Jeffrey Ruffing, an assistive technology development specialist with the Inglis Innovation Center, collaborates with volunteer groups throughout the world who can assist with the 3D modeling necessary for 3D printing of customized AT. Once someone has created a 3D model, they share it with Jeffrey, who can click a couple of buttons and have the customized item printed in a matter of days. The Center’s Impact Accelerator is a unique program for aspiring business owners in the disability inclusion and accessibility space. The accelerator is open to businesses with impactful ideas related to assistive technology, affordable accessible housing, and innovative healthcare solutions. “We were looking at both individuals who identify as having disabilities with really great ideas, and companies who didn’t necessarily have to identify as having disabilities, but what they were creating was for the community itself,” Ruffing tells CP. “So we sent out a call for applications in January this past year, and that was across the State of Pennsylvania. We had about 18 companies apply to the program, and through a really rigorous selection process, we selected five of those companies. It turned out that all five were from the Pittsburgh area, which was lucky for us.” click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Inglis Innovation Center People at work in Inglis' new Bellevue location Each company gets $5,000 just for being selected into the cohort. The accelerator teaches the “fundamental basics of business development to the companies and walks them through really key components of what it means to start and run a business, and then how to scale that business.” At the end of the 15-week program, they give their business pitches. Anyone is allowed to attend their final pitch and the company who wins the “popular vote” (i.e. “The People’s Choice Awards”) gets an extra $5,000. The winner of the popular vote this year was Cookie Cookie Ice Cream. Companies such as Alex Geht’s TestaSeat, Jennifer Price’s Dime Network TV, Ty Allen’s Unity Concord Real Estate, Cookie Cookie Ice Cream, and Robert Breen’s River City Growers were all in the latest cohort. click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Inglis Innovation Center A gaming space at Inglis' new Bellevue space As for why the business accelerator focuses on disability, Ruffing explains that there are fewer grants available for research focused on assistive technology (AT), which means there are fewer researchers able to put the time and effort into creating much needed assistive technology. The lack of research means that there are fewer researchers able to take a product from the research lab to the marketplace. Additionally, founders with disabilities are less likely to receive resources and access to capital as their non-disabled counterparts. “Our Accelerator highlights the strengths of founders with disabilities and showcases their competitive advantage. We not only want founders with disabilities at the table, we want to create a world where they own the table to begin with,” Marmo says. When it comes to the future of assistive technology, Marmo notes, “There are two markets, really. The disability community is currently untapped when it comes to technology available to them and innovations to better serve them. There's a lot of opportunity in tailoring innovations for this community based on user input and feedback.” “Additionally,” she says, “the older adult community is expanding, especially in Pennsylvania. We see potential in both markets with different, but similar, needs that innovation can address, especially when innovation is co-created and co-designed alongside the community.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Health, Inglis Innovation Center, Leah Marmo, Jeffrey Ruffing, Bellevue Related Content Your down-ballot votes have the biggest impact, officials and candidates say By Colin Williams Oct 10, 2023 Stay Weird, Pittsburgh: A catnapping in Bellevue, Mastriano's 9/11 tribute, and more By Hannah Kinney-Kobre Sep 16, 2022 Pittsburgh community garden receives major grant to expand its operations By Amanda Waltz Aug 20, 2021 Latest in Health Healing Pittsburgh’s Black community through therapy, spirituality, and yoga By Jordan Snowden Feb 26, 2025 Norovirus is surging.

A press release from the SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania union states that on Oct. 7, Western Psych nurses \"voted unanimously to authorize a strike.\" The decision comes a little over two months into workers negotiating a new union contract with UPMC after their previous contract expired on Sept. 30. Since Aug. 1, the group states, it has \"made proposals for solutions aimed at improving the quality of patient care,\" including \"better minimum staffing levels, higher wages for entry-level nurses and compensation that will retain experienced employees,\" all of which they claim UPMC \"has rejected.\" The group plans to hold a Rally for Mental Healthcare on Wed., Oct. 16 aimed to \"convince UPMC to negotiate a fair contract that improves patient care and working conditions.\" Should it fail, they will set a strike date. “We are in an all-out, national mental health emergency and UPMC’s lack of investment has seriously curtailed Western Psych’s capacity to face this crisis,” Dr. Kenneth Thompson, a leading psychiatrist in Pittsburgh and nationally, stated in the press release. “We were in deep trouble before the pandemic and it’s even worse now. We must have all hands on deck to meet the needs and address the suffering in our communities. The frontline nurses at Western Psych are dedicated to their work and have very tough jobs.\" Western Psych nurses gathered in front of their Oakland workplace on Sept. 24 — days before the expiration of their previous union contract — to detail their inability to provide quality care to patients due to what they see as a severe lack of support from UPMC. This has led, they claim, to a massive turnover rate over the past three years, and many positions remain unfilled. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania protest in Oakland, Sept. 24, 2024 Western Psych nurses claim that UPMC has also closed \"dozens of beds\" throughout their facility, making it more difficult to treat patients of all ages struggling with mental illness including schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's, eating disorders, substance use disorder, and autism. Zachariah Flynn, a nurse in Western Psych’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders Unit, expands on this, stating that UPMC reduced the number of beds in his unit from 28 to 11 beds. As a result, Flynn said patients seeking care \"have to wait months for backlogged outpatient appointments.\" \"I feel like UPMC is not only disrespecting nurses, but every Western Pennsylvania family who has a loved one struggling with autism or a mental health issue,\" said Flynn, who says he became a psych nurse because he has two younger brothers with autism. When Pittsburgh City Paper reached out to UPMC for comment, the healthcare giant provided the following statement: \"UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital is committed to supporting our employees, patients and community. Contract negotiations between the parties are ongoing, and the hospital continues to bargain in good faith.\" The apparent crisis at Western Psych comes as a third of Pennsylvania residents face struggles with \"mental health or substance use disorder\" diagnoses, according to a 2022 report from the commonwealth's Behavioral Health Commission for Adult Mental Health. Even so, a 2023 Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania survey projected 6,330 unfilled mental health professional positions in the commonwealth by 2026, based on the anticipated need and anticipated number of mental health professionals. SEIU partly attributes this potential shortfall to the \"undervaluing and undercompensation of mental health professionals.\" Thompson stressed that Western Psych staff remains \"underpaid and understaffed,\" even as UPMC executives \"use their enormous resources to lease a luxury jet and pay themselves millions.\" \"It is past time to realign UPMC’s priorities and the first step is for our entire community to support the nurses at Western Psych who are advocating for all of us,\" Thompson concluded.Correction: The article originally stated that 6,330 mental health professional positions are currently unfilled when they are projected for 2026. A quote from SEIU was also incorrectly attributed to Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.

UPMC nurses say the system’s — and region’s — biggest mental healthcare facility is at an inflection point. Western Psychiatric Hospital faces an acute staffing shortage and a lack of resources, nurses say, and turnover in the past three years has exceeded 100%. Amy Kenny, the most senior nurse at the hospital, says the situation is as dire as she’s ever seen it. “I've been on the front lines and witnessed Pennsylvania's mental health emergency get worse and worse, and I've watched with increasing alarm as Western Psych's capacity to handle the crisis has diminished,” she told assembled media at the rally. Kenny and others are members of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, the commonwealth’s largest nurses union. They see a growing disparity between them and their Allegheny Health Network peers, especially following recent union victories at AHN facilities. SEIU nurses at Western Psych are currently pursuing a new contract with UPMC and seeking public support via a petition. John Hobdy, a Western Psych nurse, says his floor has been hard hit by staffing problems. “On my floor, one wing is completely closed, and the other two have beds closed. During the night shift, nurses are often responsible for 14 patients each,” Hobdy told media. Hobdy said patients with dementia or in a catatonic state need delicate care that overstretched nurses often can’t provide. “One mistake with these patients can lead to disaster,\" he said. Hobdy and others filled the sidewalk near the Western Psych entrance, backed by the sweeping glass façade of UPMC Presbyterian’s $1.5 billion tower expansion. Multiple speakers slammed the expansion and UPMC’s well-compensated executives — both of which Pittsburgh City Paper covered in August — and recent revelations that the health nonprofit’s CEO Leslie Davis had been using the company’s $50 million private jet to fly multiple times to Boca Raton, Fla., where she owns multiple homes. “We have a billion-dollar hospital being built right there that is not going to benefit the people of this community,” Ken Thompson, a public health community psychiatrist, told the crowd. “It's only going to make the people who have a lot of money richer and get more of their cronies richer, while our psychiatric units suffer from bed closures.” Jeffrey Shook, a Pitt professor of social work and co-principal investigator of the Pittsburgh Wage Study, noted that “90% of health care workers in one survey reported that they did not have enough staff to handle the work.” He points out that this has created a mental health crisis among mental healthcare workers. “We found that rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and trauma among healthcare workers were very high — alarmingly high,” he said. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams UPMC nurse John Hobdy gives remarks on Sept. 24, 2024. Elected officials who attended said they fully support the nurses’ pursuit of better working conditions. Pa. Rep. Dan Frankel (D-23), who represents the district containing the hospital — and whose wife worked at Western Psych for many years — said the facility was essential to local healthcare. “There are few institutions in our area better positioned to help our community than the one we are standing in front of today,” Frankel said, “[but] I've seen a great deal of troubling behavior from UPMC, an organization that enjoys the benefits of nonprofit tax status.” Frankel and Pittsburgh city councilmember Erika Strassburger offered strong support for the nurses union, as did Pa. Rep. Dan Miller (D-42), chair of the Pa. House’s Mental Health Caucus. “Where is that mental health plan for Allegheny County? Where is that mental health plan for UPMC?” Miller wondered as UPMC workers took pictures of the rally from upper-floor windows. “We don't need 50 of the workers who are here … We need another 400 workers to be here, and the state must partner with allies who will get it done.” Noting the rise in substance abuse disorders, an ongoing nursing shortage, and the proximity of the Pitt campus (nurses chanted “more scrubs, less suits\" as Pitt students walked past), Miller said UPMC had an obligation to work with the community, invest more resources in mental healthcare more broadly, and negotiate with their nurses in good faith. “You either support them, [or] you're losing lives,” Miller said. “UPMC knows this.” Hobdy, an Iraq War veteran, said he cares deeply about his work. “As one of the only Black male nurses at Western Psych and a Pittsburgh native, I take special pride in providing compassionate, culturally competent care to patients of color,” Hobdy told the crowd. “But when we're operating with less than a skeleton crew, it’s very difficult to provide the care our patients deserve.” “We will be there to fight with you,” he said. “We just need to be sure UPMC joins us in that fight.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Health, Western Psych, UPMC, SEIU Healthcare, John Hobdy, Amy Kenny, Ken Thompson, Dan Frankel, Jeffrey Shook, University of Pittsburgh Related Content Looking back on The Blair Witch Project as Pitt adds the film to its archives By Amanda Waltz Feb 27, 2025 Pro-Palestine students at Pitt face dismissal, criminal charges, and the threat of canceled visas By India Krug Feb 24, 2025 Pittsburgh’s top events: Feb. 13-19 By CP Staff Feb 12, 2025 CP Year in Review: News editor Colin Williams' favorite stories of 2024 By Colin Williams Dec 24, 2024 Latest in Health Healing Pittsburgh’s Black community through therapy, spirituality, and yoga By Jordan Snowden Feb 26, 2025 Norovirus is surging.

Its expanded Mercy Hospital and corporate headquarters loom physically above the city when you enter from Parkway West. Some 4.5 million people, including many in Greater Pittsburgh, access healthcare through UPMC insurance, and the system employed around 100,000 people in 2023. As the nonprofit has ensconced itself in southwestern Pennsylvania, however, employees and patients say it has begun to act less like a charitable healthcare organization and more like a for-profit corporate titan. For starters, its executives — including one who retired in 2021 — are taking home millions of dollars in pay and flying in a private jet as UPMC expands its global footprint. These same executives then brought on infamous consultant McKinsey & Co. ahead of laying off over 1,000 workers and slashing pay for travel nurses, framing these cuts as necessary to UPMC’s survival. Patients tell Pittsburgh City Paper they’ve seen a concurrent increase in fees and drop in the quality of customer service and patient care. UPMC institutions also rank near the bottom of American hospitals in terms of community investments per the Lown Institute, a nonpartisan thinktank that has published extensively on health systems’ expenditures. Local leaders say the clear gulf between UPMC's C-suite and the workers staffing its hospitals, coupled with the nonprofit’s ongoing reluctance to pay more property taxes on its $1.7 billion in real estate, leaves UPMC looking less like a good corporate citizen and more like a Gilded Age monopoly. City Paper spoke on and off the record with UPMC employees, patients, and local leadership to get a clearer sense of the disconnect between UPMC’s jetsetting executives and recently laid-off workers. What we found paints a picture of a nonprofit operating in a similar fashion to a for-profit company without the attendant tax burden. CP also reached out to both UPMC and McKinsey multiple times via email and phone with detailed questions, but we have yet to receive any response from either. Survival of the fittest UPMC has long raised eyebrows for its high executive pay. The most recent data shows president and CEO Leslie C. Davis taking home over $10 million per year in pay. Others, including board members and highly regarded surgeons, also make salaries in the low seven figures. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Ron Kaplan, a recent UPMC patient, poses for a portrait at his home. CP also discovered that, since suddenly leaving UPMC in 2021, former president and CEO Jeffrey Romoff has continued to make millions off his former employer. Romoff took home around $18 million in deferred compensation in 2023. He left in his wake a much larger hospital system overall, but Romoff also reportedly busted unions, shuttered hospitals, and engaged in controversial liver transplant practices all while giving himself six-figure raises. His deferred compensation package is millions more than what the city has sought to collect annually from UPMC — around $14 million in 2021 — in property taxes (City of Pittsburgh officials declined to comment for this story). Alex Wallach-Hanson of Pittsburgh United, a local advocacy coalition focused on housing, economic, and environmental justice, says this top-heavy pay structure reflects a focus on profit at the expense of local investment. “UPMC continues to trend away from their history as a community-based nonprofit and towards this corporatized healthcare monopoly,” he says. “We've gone from a city that had a tax base that was driven by extraction industry to now having a city whose tax base has been driven by property taxes,” Wallach-Hanson says. “If our two largest industries are nonprofit eds and nonprofit meds, we can't build … a thriving city without those industries paying into our tax system.” As pay steadily increased for Romoff and others, and UPMC shelled out $37 million for marketing, the nonprofit was slow to raise its minimum wage and, headed into 2024, sought to trim back staffing levels that swelled during the worst of COVID. To do so, UPMC enlisted McKinsey & Co., a consulting firm that has long been known for helping companies “rightsize” operations — often by laying off lower-level staff while maintaining high executive pay and investor returns. More recently, McKinsey came under fire for charging New York City $1.6 million to suggest the city use trash cans and paying out $78 million in opioid settlement money for its work with controversial OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma. Even as the hospital system moved ahead with a $1.5 billion expansion of UPMC Presbyterian in Oakland, UPMC and McKinsey were figuring out where to cut staff. The company revealed its plans to staff earlier this year with a slideshow announcing its 2024 strategic priorities. CP was able to view the slides through an anonymous source. Framing a reduction in headcount as “tough, but necessary,” UPMC insisted it would not be cutting patient- or member-facing staff — however, the presentation lamented, an organizational restructure was needed in the face of the “strong headwinds” of a “post-pandemic marketplace.” The slide in which this change was announced prominently features an image of Sisyphus — the mythological figure doomed to roll a boulder up a hill for all eternity. Another slide detailing UPMC’s partnership with McKinsey prominently features an image of Charles Darwin with a quote about species responding to change in order to survive. “We are confidently going forward with approx. 1 percent less leader positions (difficult),” a subsequent slide on “Transformation” reads. The laid-off employees CP spoke to said the announcement of cuts came as a shock given UPMC’s rapid expansion. One says that the cuts in their department had a disproportionate impact on working single mothers. “Let's be real here: whenever it comes to jobs for women who are mothers, it is hard for us to locate employ[ers] who are willing to work around our family schedules,” this employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, tells CP. “UPMC hit at the worst possible time.” This person was laid off shortly after being shown the Sisyphus and Darwin slides. The former employee says UPMC obscured the true scope of layoffs by conducting them department by department and immediately bricking laid-off employees’ work-issued devices, including laptops. “There was no humanity in it at all,” they add. To Boca and back In spite of promises not to cut public-facing staff, UPMC executives were laying the groundwork to do just that as they sat aboard the company’s leased Bombardier Global 6500 jet on April 23. The aircraft, which sells for $50 million and costs millions to operate and service each year, features a livery striped with UPMC’s official purple as well as a spacious interior with “revolutionary” seating. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson UPMC Mercy The executives were on their way to Boca Raton, Fla., headquarters of Omega Healthcare, which also maintains offices in the Philippines. Their business? Providing outsourced customer service for healthcare giants like UPMC in order to “accelerate cash flow” and “reduce administrative costs.” The Pittsburgh-area employees who previously answered calls from those insured through UPMC soon found themselves on the wrong end of the McKinsey-led restructuring — and replaced by Filipino workers. In May, UPMC executives again fired up the jet, taking it to Orange County, back to Boca, and then overseas to Rome and Dublin, where UPMC maintains clinics. UPMC also maintains a clinic in Kazakhstan and announced a new Hillman Cancer Center in Croatia late last year. Wallach-Hanson says this international expansion has coincided with the shuttering of hospitals in rural communities that are “less profitable.” “UPMC chooses to invest their money in opening hospitals for the ultra-rich in countries around the world, while at the same time claiming a billion-dollar shortfall in their budget that they need to make up for,” says Wallach-Hanson. Other trips included flights to Chicago and New York City. CEO Davis made several flights to and from Florida up to a year ahead of UPMC’s shifting of jobs from Greater Pittsburgh to offshore call centers and, former employees tell CP, had already been paying Omega to handle overflow calls. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Ron Kaplan, a recent UPMC patient, poses for a portrait at his home. Workers say they had a bad feeling about the future of their roles months before the layoffs actually hit and that morale among staff was low. They also say locals had complained about issues with offshore representatives’ ability to address concerns. The anonymous laid-off employee says that when UPMC staff raised concerns about Omega’s quality and HIPAA compliance, they were told the arrangement was here to stay. “I can tell you right now that there is going to be an impact on patient care,” they say. CP also spoke to patients who said they had had recent negative experiences with UPMC. Ron Kaplan is one such patient — he switched from a different primary care provider (PCP) to his wife’s UPMC PCP on her advice, but was later dismayed when he says UPMC levied facility fees that made routine blood work $160 more expensive than it had been at his old doctor. “The service they … provided, between the examination and the blood test, were exactly the same as what I had at my previous PCP,” Kaplan tells CP. Kaplan pressed his case with UPMC Health Plan staff but says escalation of his complaints went nowhere, and later, phone calls “seem[ed] to be farmed out” to overseas workers. Kaplan is considering switching back to his previous doctor. “I find it impossible to justify UPMC’s higher cost,” he tells CP. “This is not going to kill us financially, but it's still a burden,” he says. “Given their resources, and given how much we're paying for insurance … it seems it's a bogus fee and went to enrich them.” Global wealth, local poverty It doesn’t have to be this way, locals say. Some people CP spoke to for this story say Allegheny Health Network (AHN), UPMC’s chief rival in the region, offers one point of contrast. AHN pays its workers better, for one, and negotiated a new three-year contract including significant raises with its nurses late last year. The city has also challenged AHN’s tax-exempt status on far fewer properties than UPMC — 57 for the latter compared to six for the former. click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Pittsburgh skyline Comparisons aside, Wallach-Hanson of Pittsburgh United says UPMC should do more to take care of local employees, especially ones who, like Romoff, have worked for the nonprofit for decades. “We've heard of people who worked at UPMC for 40-plus years being brought into a room, told they were let go on the spot, and being walked out of the building,” Wallach-Hanson says. “And, of course, that has an impact on people's ability to afford their rent, to afford groceries.” Local leaders and community advocates worry that allowing UPMC to continue cutting staff while pouring money into an expanding network of hospitals worldwide essentially gives the company carte blanche to behave as a megacorporation — while continuing to avoid paying local taxes. “A city like Pittsburgh is not going to thrive if our fastest and largest growing industries aren't contributing money into our tax base,” Wallach-Hanson says. “It really raises the question of, should UPMC continue to get their nonprofit tax status if they're going to continue to prioritize CEO compensation, investing in countries around the world, and not investing in care for people in Pittsburgh?” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Health, UPMC, McKinsey & Co., Pittsburgh United Related Content CP Year in Review: News editor Colin Williams' favorite stories of 2024 By Colin Williams Dec 24, 2024 Western Psych nurses vote to strike, claiming UPMC has undermined mental healthcare By Amanda Waltz Oct 9, 2024 Nurses say Western Psych is in crisis as they push for a new contract with UPMC By Colin Williams Sep 24, 2024 COVID's still here, but mitigation is not.

Whenever picketers surround Pittsburgh’s abortion clinics, volunteers are on the scene to usher patients safely inside. One of them is Laura. Laura has been volunteering as an abortion clinic escort in Pittsburgh for more than 30 years. She calls her relationships with patients “exceedingly brief, but critical nonetheless.” Clinic escorts act as a buffer between patients walking into the clinic and the picketers Laura has dubbed “antis.” “The intention is multiple,” Laura tells Pittsburgh City Paper. “To identify ourselves, to give the patient information, and also to give them something to listen to — so they're not focused on listening to the [anti-abortion activists].’” Laura is a coordinator with Pittsburgh Pro-Choice Escorts, a group that organizes volunteers to stand in front of the city’s two abortion clinics — Planned Parenthood of Western PA in Downtown and Allegheny Reproductive Health Center in East Liberty. She got involved in 1991, when the organization was just a few years old. It was formed in response to massive demonstrations outside the clinics. “I'm talking hundreds of people — three, four, or 500 people, blocking the streets, blocking the sidewalks, blocking the entrance to the clinic,” she shares. The clinic escort volunteers stand outside on Saturday mornings. Depending on the amount of picketers, some will stay closer to the doors, down at the ends of the streets or even across the street. They introduce themselves and ask if a patient would like to be accompanied. If a patient is scared, volunteers will surround them as they walk into the clinic. Laura says that anti-abortion protestors usually target younger people on the street because younger people tend to be polite to strangers. “And when somebody stops them on the street and says, ‘I'd like to share this information with you, here's a pamphlet’ —- they stop,” Laura shares. “So, our role at that point is to break that contact.” The volunteer group works with the Women’s Law Project to ensure buffer zones by the entrance are respected. Laura warns patients and their accompanying loved ones not to engage with picketers. She shares that a few weeks ago, volunteers had to de-escalate an altercation between a patient’s partner and a picketer. “These are very litigious people,” Laura declares. “And if you were to get into a fight with them, they would call the cops, they would get your information, and you would never be done with them. Never.” Pittsburgh clinics deal with increased hostility and picketer presence during 40 Days for Life, an anti-abortion campaign coinciding with the Lenten season. Planned Parenthood of Western PA is listed as an official vigil site, with local churches and groups covering daily shifts. Laura says she thinks it’s “creepy,” but “40 Days happens every year. We are well prepared for it.” Planned Parenthood hosts a fundraiser in response to 40 Days called “Pledge a Picketer,” which allows community members to pledge a donation for every picketer who stands outside the clinic. During high-volume periods and in general, Laura says that escorts have to steel themselves for distressing material from picketers. Closer to when she started volunteering, anti-abortion organizers would bring posters of Holocaust victims to the clinic. “So, you have to kind of be careful about what you know what your trigger is, know what your button is,” Laura says. “And if they're pushing it —- we are all about self care. We can't do our jobs if we can't take care of ourselves. We can't do the job that we need to do for patients.” As a volunteer coordinator, one of Laura’s jobs is to check in on clinic escorts throughout their shifts. She asks if anyone needs a bathroom break, a coffee, or to just sit down for a few minutes. After volunteering, Laura will often go to the library or grab a dessert from Vanilla Pastry Studio. Laura says the pro-choice movement has changed a lot in her lifetime. Since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned federal protections to abortion access, clinics in Pittsburgh have faced a surge of patients from neighboring states. Growing up during the height of second-wave feminism, she believes that the movement's narrow focus is responsible for today’s troubles. “We were able to ignore the urgent needs of Black and Brown women, poor women, rural women — anyone not like us — as we worked to secure abortion rights for ourselves,” she says. “White women need to use our privilege to demand that abortion access be convenient, affordable, and safe for every single person who wants an abortion, for whatever reason they have for making that decision.” She urges young people not to give up on the fight for reproductive justice, and is proud to be able to help community members safely get to appointments. “We are here, the clinics are here, providers are here, and we will continue to be here,” Laura says. “So fuck ‘em!” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Community Profile, Planned Parenthood of Western PA, Pittsburgh Pro-Choice Escorts, Allegheny Reproductive Health Center Related Content Abortion rights in Pa. could run through fall’s judicial election By Rachel Wilkinson Jan 15, 2025 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Adult Store Clerk, Creative Producer for KDKA, Cake Decorator, and more By Morgan Biddle Jan 22, 2024 A year and a half post-Dobbs, abortion organizing networks lift up local clinics By India Krug Dec 6, 2023 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Marijuana Dispensary Associate, Tattoo Artist, Baker, and more By Morgan Biddle Dec 4, 2023 Latest in Community Profile It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Mar 12, 2025 Is Station Square on its death bed, or just about to resurrect?

Ayanna Pressley addresses Kamala Harris supporters on July 31 at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters Progressive Democrats, including U.S. Rep. and “Squad” member Ayanna Pressley, gathered at the South Side-based Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters on July 31 to remind voters of the importance of abortion care — and whether it remains legal in states such as Pennsylvania following the 2024 general election. It was one of the first major local events for sitting Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign following President Joe Biden’s decision to step aside as presumptive nominee on July 21 and endorse his erstwhile running mate. All four speakers commented on the importance of abortion access in Pa., questioning whether a state-by-state approach to access following the end of Roe v. Wade would withstand a second Donald Trump presidency. “It's our responsibility to make sure that we don't ever go back to where Donald Trump is trying to take us,” U.S. Rep. Summer Lee said. Multiple politicians and pundits have noted that one of Harris’ main paths to the White House runs through the commonwealth, fueling speculation that current Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a staunch defender of the right to abortion care, could be tapped for Vice President. Advocate Bri Erskine, the second speaker at the event, underscored the importance of Pa.’s role in the issue by describing how a medical condition complicating menstruation and childbirth drove her here from her home state of Tennessee. “After … the Dobbs case, which eventually would ultimately overturn Roe, I came to Pittsburgh to visit friends and began to seriously consider whether I was still safe living in Tennessee with my condition,” Erskine told assembled voters, reporters, and organizers. “I literally fled my home of seven years to ensure that I would always be able to safely access health care during the day.” After Erskine, Planned Parenthood Pa. Advocates board member Sydney Etheredge recounted Harris’ career as a statewide politician in California before introducing U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, who said abortion access was part of a broader discussion around equal access to healthcare and support services. “Even in the shadows of reproductive inequality … we're going to build a country of reproductive prosperity, [where] people have opportunities and resources at every stage in their life,” Lee told the crowd. click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams U.S. Rep. Summer Lee addresses Kamala Harris supporters on July 31 at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters Pressley, a self-described “bonus mom” of one, also forcefully rowed back against unearthed commentary from Republican V.P. candidate J.D. Vance, in which he criticizes childless couples and advocates for additional taxes on households without children. “You can't tell me that that's not my baby,” Pressley said. She recounted how she learned Roe v. Wade was overturned while attending her daughter's eighth-grade graduation. \"And I was sitting in the bleachers at our eighth-grade graduation [and] immediately felt with a heavy sense of dread that my daughter would be growing up in a country with fewer rights than … my mother.” The rally took place on the same day Trump returned to the commonwealth for the first time since the assassination attempt against him in Butler. Lee said Pa. was likely to figure prominently in both the Harris and Trump campaigns’ electoral calculus — with or without Shapiro on the ticket. Lee told a press gaggle afterward that she would support whomever Harris chooses but didn’t endorse Shapiro outright. “Whoever is on that ticket, I will be out making sure that my community is protected,” she said, adding, “We've fallen short [on the response to student protests], but history shows us that there's still time to course correct.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Colin Williams U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley laughs during a speech on July 31 at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters Despite the foreboding subject matter, the mood, as at other recent Harris campaign events, reflected the “honeymoon phase” Democrats are experiencing since rallying behind Harris. The small crowd was effusive as a remix of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” played, and Pressley acknowledged that both parties would need to work at keeping that enthusiasm high to succeed on Nov. 5. “Let me just make a commitment right now,” she said. “I will be back.” Slideshow Kamala Harris and Tim Walz campaign near Pittsburgh Click to View 24 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Ayanna Pressley, Bri Erskine, Sydney Etheredge, Summer Lee, Donald Trump, Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, Election 2024, Allegheny County Democratic Party, the Squad, Slideshow Related Content Rep.

Wade By Jamie Wiggan click to enlarge CP Photo: Lisa Cunningham Anti-abortion protesters celebrate the Roe v. Wade ruling and hand out literature to passersby outside Downtown Pittsburgh's Planned Parenthood location on Fri., June 24, 2022. Although anticipated for months, today’s announcement that Roe v. Wade will no longer protect the right to abortion has set off shockwaves around the nation and here in Pittsburgh. Democratic officeholders and abortion advocates say they will work to ensure abortion remains legal in Pennsylvania, while Republicans laud the seismic overturn of legal precedent. A press release issued by Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania reminds local residents abortion remains legal and available in the Commonwealth, but notes, “anti-abortion legislators are attempting to change the Pennsylvania state constitution with an extreme bill proposing to permanently amend our constitution and remove any state protection for abortion access.” I won’t stop providing abortions. I won’t stop helping people.— my good bitch 🌿 (@clozilly) June 24, 2022 PPWP President and CEO Sydney Etheredge issued a statement attempting to assure those contemplating abortions now or in the future. “Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania wants to let those who are seeking an abortion know that we are here for you. Your decision to control your lives, bodies, and futures should be yours, and yours alone, and we will not compromise on this.“ Local officeholders including Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey have also weighed in on the news, with the mayor insisting he “will do whatever it takes to protect and defend that right in Pittsburgh and across our entire Commonwealth.” “We must ensure that people can make decisions about their bodies, their lives, and their futures and all of us must recommit ourselves to the work of making America more just and equal for everyone,\" Gainey says. The U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of reproductive rights at the federal level will turn the spotlight on state legislatures, which now have the power to pass laws restricting abortions. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has vowed to veto any anti-abortion bills in the state, but his seat expires in November, when he will be replaced by either Democrat Josh Shapiro or Republican Doug Mastriano. We have been representing abortion providers in Pennsylvania since 1974. We are not going anywhere. https://t.co/ygBSFU99d0— Women's Law Project (@WomensLawProj) June 24, 2022 Shapiro issued a statement this morning voicing his opposition to the ruling, and vowed as current attorney general to protect the practice of reproductive health care from legal challenges. “While this decision has no immediate impact here in Pennsylvania, it opens the door for our legislature to ban or criminalize abortion by simply passing a law—because there are no longer federal protections,\" Shapiro says. \"I will fight any attempt to erode women's rights in our Commonwealth.” Meanwhile, Mastriano, a stanch conservative, has frequently indicated support for restricting abortion in Pennsylvania. In a press statement issued at the time of the May 3 court leak, Mastriano referred to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision as “one of the darkest days in American history.” He went on to refer to abortion as “anti-scientific genocide” and heralded former President Donald Trump’s role in securing a conservative majority in the courts. Mastriano, a current Pennsylvania senator, introduced a bill to that would require physicians to determine “whether the baby has a heartbeat” before performing an abortion. The bill, introduced in 2021, has six co-sponsors but hasn’t made it out of the health committee. Separately, a move to ammend the Pennsylvania constitution to include language prohibiting support or funding for abortions is also moving through the General Assembly. If it passes, the move must then be approved by voters in a statewide ballot referendum. Across the state, other Republican officeholders have heralded the ruling as a conservative victory that grants states the right to choose their own laws and policies. “Today's ruling is a major victory for the pro-life movement, but our work has only begun,\" says Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican Congressman from Butler County. \"All little boys and little girls deserve a chance at life, and this ruling ensures they will get that chance.\" Below, we've curated a range of local responses: Pa. State Rep. Austin Davis (D-McKeesport) and Democratic candidate for Pa. Lieutenant Governor “Reversing Roe v. Wade is not only an attack on the right to an abortion but puts a person’s essential freedoms, including their ability to make decisions about their own body, at risk. The consequences of this decision are severe and far-reaching. Restricting abortion access can threaten the health of pregnant people and babies, increase maternal mortality rates and force low-income women and families to face further financial hardships.\" Pa. Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-West View) \"I am completely devastated over today’s Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which has overturned the right to a safe, legal abortion in this country, but I am ready to fight back. I will always stand for a woman’s right to healthcare, and that includes abortion. Deciding if, when, and with whom to start or grow a family is a human right. I trust people to make the best decisions about their lives, families and their healthcare. This fight is about our right to privacy and our right to bodily autonomy.\" Laura Nevitt, Operations Manager of Keystone Progress \"We got gut-wrenching news today. The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that protected our right to abortion in the U.S. With its cruel decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the court gave states the right to ban abortion. For the first time EVER, it stole a right it once granted Americans. Who knows what rights we'll lose next? We can grieve now, but not for long, because this is the time that WE MUST FIGHT for our rights — the right to control our bodies and to protect our privacy. Politicians should NOT have the power to make our medical decisions for us.\" Pa. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (2022 candidate for U.S Senate): “Deciding how and when to become a mother is a decision that should always be made by a woman and her doctor — not politicians. If there were any doubts left about what’s at stake in this race, it became crystal clear today. The right to an abortion will be on the ballot this November in Pennsylvania. I will protect abortion rights. Dr. Oz will take them away. It’s that simple.” Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey: \"Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an attack on the civil and human rights of our entire country. Abortion is healthcare and denying the right to bodily autonomy of women, trans men, non-binary, and disabled people in America is stripping them of their fundamental right to privacy. Abortion is still legal in Pennsylvania and I will do whatever it takes to protect and defend that right in Pittsburgh and across our entire Commonwealth. We must ensure that people can make decisions about their bodies, their lives, and their futures and all of us must recommit ourselves to the work of making America more just and equal for everyone.\" Pa. Attorney General Josh Shapiro (2022 candidate for Pa. governor) “The Dobbs decision will go down as a shameful moment for our country and for the Court. Today, five Supreme Court Justices upended fifty years of settled law and subjected the health and private lives of millions of American women to the whims of politicians. As a result of today’s decision, every American's personal freedoms now depend on the state in which they live. Here in Pennsylvania, decisions about your bodies will now be left to elected officials in Harrisburg– giving those politicians more power than women in our Commonwealth.\" Pa. Gov. Tom Wolf “First and most importantly, it is critical that everyone understands that abortion services are available and unharmed in Pennsylvania by today’s Supreme Court action. Providers may still provide reproductive health care services and patients should continue the health care plan they’ve developed with their physicians. Nonetheless, I am deeply disappointed in today’s Supreme Court opinion and the impact this decision will have nationwide. The right to bodily autonomy—and privacy as a whole—is under attack in this country. We must do more to protect the rights of women and pregnant people in every state across the country that doesn’t have a governor willing to wield their veto pen.\" U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Lehigh): “The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization restores the American people’s ability to determine abortion laws through their elected representatives, as the Constitution requires. Precedents that are wrongly decided should be overturned, just as Brown v. Board of Education was right to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson. This ruling is a win for the unborn, the Constitution, and democratic governance. Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates Executive Director Signe Espinoza: “Roe vs Wade was a landmark decision in abortion rights and access to medical care. Today’s decision threatens those most basic freedoms, invades our privacy, and questions our autonomy. This decision allows states far more control over our bodies, but right now, abortion remains legal in Pennsylvania and PPPA will fight to keep it that way. Furthermore, PPPA is going to continue its advocacy to make abortion accessible to every Pennsylvanian who needs one.\" Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania President and CEO Sydney Etheredge: “I am saddened by the Supreme Court’s decision today. While we knew this could be our reality following the leaked opinion, knowing now that we will be living in a post-Roe world is heartbreaking. For now, abortion is still legal in Pennsylvania, and we will do everything in our power to keep it that way. Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania wants to let those who are seeking an abortion know that we are here for you. Your decision to control your lives, bodies, and futures should be yours, and yours alone, and we will not compromise on this.“ U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Butler): \"Today's ruling is a major victory for the pro-life movement, but our work has only begun. All little boys and little girls deserve a chance at life, and this ruling ensures they will get that chance. The right to life is not just for some of us. It is for all of us. I want to speak directly to those who have had abortions and struggle with their decision: you should know that forgiveness and grace – for yourself and others – will help heal those emotional wounds. As we move forward, I encourage everyone to remember a core tenet of this country that still holds true today: each of us has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Pa. House Republican Leaders Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) and House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff (R-Centre/Mifflin): “Today’s Supreme Court ruling reestablishes the authority of states to regulate abortion. The ruling once again makes clear it is the authority of individual states to establish laws that are in the best interest of their residents. It is important to point out Pennsylvania’s Abortion Control Act remains in effect, and places firm restrictions on abortions in our Commonwealth including a ban on all late-term abortion procedures. This ruling presents a necessary opportunity to examine our existing abortion law, and discussions around possible changes are already underway.” Pa. Sen. Jay Costa (D-Forest Hills) “I am disheartened by the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade. Despite today’s action, Senate Democrats stand firm in our commitment to do everything we can to preserve and maintain legal and safe access to abortion in Pennsylvania. Abortion is healthcare. Any decision by the Supreme Court to take away healthcare and an individual's bodily autonomy is, in our opinion, a violation of the Supreme Court’s authority and interpretation of our Constitution.\" Pa. Rep. Jessica Benham (D-South Side): \"This decision is a disgrace to women and to the Constitution. And it can be overruled by a Democratic Congress. All of us who care about progress and democracy need to come together and stick together.\" President of SisTers PGH Ciora Thomas: \"The stakes have never been higher for reproductive rights, for LGBTQ+ rights, for human rights, in this country that refuses to dismantle its oppressive, archaic, fascist system that holds down anyone who is not white and cisgender. Everyone, from individual activists to church and community leaders and legislators, must play a role in this deconstruction and ending the medical and social apartheid that is taking us backwards to a place no society deserves to be.\" U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Mt. Lebanon): \"This decision is a disgrace to women and to the Constitution. And it can be overruled by a Democratic Congress. All of us who care about progress and democracy need to come together and stick together.\" Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald: \"I’m the father of eight, including six daughters. My wife and I worked hard to ensure that every one of our children were treated equally and had the same opportunities. Today, the @USSupremeCourt has taken us backwards with this decision. It takes away my daughters’ autonomy and that of every other woman in this country. It’s staggering and unfathomable that attacks against women like this are coming from the highest Court in the land. I’m committed to work, and now even more motivated, to ensure that we elect people across the board in November who will protect and further women’s rights in this country, not subvert them.\" President and CEO of New Voices for Reproductive Justice La'Tasha Mayes (and Pa. Rep. candidate): “To hear the news that Roe v. Wade was overturned still hit me like a ton of bricks. We have been operating under this false idea that women, transgender and non-binary folx have control over our bodies when the reality is — our government has control over our bodies.” Pa. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Swissvale) and U.S. Rep. candidate: \"A sad, shameful day. We lost our right to abortion care b/c of right-wing extremists appointed to lifetime seats. It's horrible & unsurprising, but it's not over. We have to do everything we can to defend this right in states where abortion rights are still protected. In Pennsylvania, the only thing standing between our rights and the extreme bans of the Republican legislature is a Democratic Governor. At the federal level, we have to decriminalize reproductive healthcare and ensure states have the resources to provide care & fund clinics. It's a grim day for our fundamental rights, especially Black & brown women & birthing folk who are going to be even more impacted by this decision, but we have to keep fighting b/c the truth remains people deserve care & they deserve this freedom & we can't stop til they get it.\" Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Politics, Roe Vs.

Since then, although jail administrators say they have been in compliance with the ban, incarcerated individuals, advocates, and some members of the Jail Oversight Board have raised doubts. Their concerns appear to be supported by two expert reports commissioned by the Abolitionist Law Center, a local public-interest law firm, in litigation against the jail. The referendum defined solitary confinement as the confinement of any individual to their cell for more than 20 hours a day, lists exceptional circumstances in which temporary solitary confinement may be used, and requires the jail to document those exceptions in a monthly report to the Jail Oversight Board. Although the referendum banned the use of solitary confinement as punishment, psychiatrist Terry Kupers, who identifies himself as an “expert on the psychiatric effects of prison conditions and correctional mental health issues,” reports that he spoke with people incarcerated at the jail who say they were placed in solitary confinement due to “misconducts” or in some cases because they asked for mental health care. In addition to documenting allegations that the jail has continued to use solitary confinement in ways prohibited by the referendum, Kupers’s report calls into question jail administrators’ claims that the jail is providing four hours of out-of-cell time to most people held there. Kupers reports that what jail officials refer to as “out-of-cell time” occurs in “unattractive ‘cages’ where prisoners can choose to spend four hours out-of-cell, and because of the design very few choose to do so.” Brad Hansen, a retired prison warden, also writes in his report that Allegheny County Jail is not, in his view, complying with the referendum. Hansen writes in his report that “unfortunately, solitary is still a reality for many at ACJ … the measures taken by Allegheny County to avoid solitary do no such thing.” Below are the data on solitary confinement from the jail’s February 2023 report to the oversight board. They document instances of individuals spending more than 20 hours a day in their cell that the jail argues fall under the referendum’s exceptions. A spokesperson for the jail declined to comment on the matter, citing pending litigation. February 2023 at the Allegheny County Jail —Pod or facility-wide lockdowns, where incarcerated individuals are confined in their cells for 20 hours or more, occurred on 18 days in February 2023. —In addition to lockdowns, the jail reports placing 88 people in solitary confinement in February 2023. —The youngest person placed in solitary confinement during this time was 17 and the oldest was 69. Source: Segregated housing report —The number of people held at the Allegheny County Jail is up 14 percent since Jan. 1, 2023. Source: Jail population dashboard Highlights from March’s Jail Oversight Board Meeting LYNCHING TATTOO Board members discussed two allegations documented in legal testimony against the jail that a correctional officer working at the jail has a tattoo depicting the lynching of a Black baby. During the March 2 meeting, board member Bethany Hallam called for an investigation, and Warden Orlando Harper said he had no knowledge of such a tattoo, but that even if it existed, it is not a legal reason to fire an employee. Elliot Howsie, a county judge and oversight board member, agreed. DIRECTOR VACANCYAlso during the meeting, board members asked jail administration to confirm rumors that the jail’s previous medical director, an employee of Allegheny Health Network, had been reassigned to a new position. Harper confirmed this, and said the personnel change did not warrant notifying the oversight board. The jail currently has an interim medical director, Dr. Bill Jonjulio. Harper says the jail has a plan regarding how to operate during the search for a new medical director but refused to speak about it. Neither AHN nor the jail has provided a reason for the personnel change. Other Jail News from March 2023 CARE CRISISIn a collaboration with Black Pittsburgh and the Garrison Project, Pittsburgh City Paper examines recent litigation and complaints alleging abuse, misconduct, and dysfunction at the jail. COMPETENCY TRAPA joint investigation by Spotlight PA and the Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism found that the process by which Pennsylvania courts determine if someone with a mental illness is “competent” to stand trial often ends up trapping them in jail for prolonged periods, where poor conditions exacerbate the symptoms of their illness. Journalists also found that the majority of people waiting for their competency reviews were accused of low-level offenses. Spotlight PA went on to assess the partial solutions to this problem currently employed by police, public defenders, and jails. NO TRENDS WESA reports that an outside contractor hired by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald to conduct a “historical review” of deaths at the jail gave a mostly favorable report of conditions, reporting that “no significant trends or common factors that would show a particular weakness or gap in operations.” REQUIREMENT REPEALEDIn March, Allegheny County Council voted to repeal the requirement that employees at the jail must live in the county. Most county employees are required to become county residents within the first year of their employment if they aren’t already. Supporters of this change hope it will ease the jail’s chronic under-staffing. Who was in jail this month? Population of jail and alternative housing on March 31, 2023: 1,738 individuals. Jail population is up 14 percent from Jan. 1, 2023. Gender: Most people in the jail are men. Women make up about 11% of the jail population. It’s unclear how many trans, nonbinary, and/or gender nonconforming people there are in the jail. Race: 68% of people incarcerated at the jail this month were Black. Allegheny County as a whole is 13% Black. Children: Twenty-one individuals under 18 are currently held in the jail, making up approximately 2% of its average daily population.\\ Senior citizens: One hundred seventy-five individuals over the age of 65 are currently held in the jail, making up 10% of its average daily population.

Meanwhile, incarcerees are left without healthcare and a depleted staff continues doling out solitary confinement despite a new countywide ban. This story was produced in partnership with Black Pittsburgh and The Garrison Project, an independent, nonpartisan organization addressing the crisis of mass incarceration and policing. Gerald Thomas was depressed. It was early March 2022 and he’d been incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail for almost a year on a probation violation. Just a few weeks earlier, his family thought he was coming home after his attorney convinced the court that the March 2021 police search of his vehicle that produced a firearm was illegal. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Thomas, but Court of Common Pleas judge Anthony Mariani wanted Thomas sent to state prison and said, “I have to put you in the cage, lasso you, corral you, stuff you, because you won't quit.” In mid-February, Thomas was sent back to jail after the second hearing on his probation violation. On March 6, Thomas complained of a pain in his left leg that went untreated for about a week. That day, after he ended a video call with his girlfriend who had recently given birth to his fourth child, a daughter, Thomas collapsed near his cell on the upper tier of the jail. Several incarcerated people attempted to help Thomas after he fell down at around 12:20 p.m., according to witness interviews conducted by the Abolitionist Law Center, a Pittsburgh-based public interest law firm, and a recent National Commission on Correctional Health Care report. Jail staff sent them back to their cells and handcuffed Thomas. Someone yelled, “Medical emergency!” according to an incarcerated witness. Nurses and a medical provider rushed to his body. The medical provider slapped his face, thinking he was overdosing. Thomas was administered Narcan twice. One member of the jail staff called 911, and eventually paramedics arrived. They strapped a machine to Thomas’s chest that performed compressions. After being unconscious on the floor for over an hour, Thomas was loaded onto a gurney. Someone picked up Thomas’s prison-issued tablet and texted his girlfriend, “Idk what’s going on with GG but he fell out about an hour ago & he was unresponsive.” The person added, “Make sure u call down here to checc [sic] the status on him or they won’t say nun [nothing].” As his body was being taken to UPMC Mercy hospital at 1:37pm, the person texted again, “Please make sure u checc [sic] on him … I hope he’s ok.” By then, a blood clot dislodged from Thomas’s leg and was embedded in one of the arteries leading to his lungs, blocking the blood flow, causing a pulmonary embolism. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Thomas was pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m.. He was 26 years old. “Objectively unreasonable” It’s unclear if Thomas’s life could have been saved, but the Mayo Clinic says prompt treatment can dramatically increase the chances of survival following a pulmonary embolism. According to the Mayo Clinic, inactivity — especially during situations where a person is in a cramped position for a prolonged period of time — can be a principal cause of life-ending clots. According to the Allegheny County jail’s legally mandated solitary confinement reports, excluding two days in January 2022, the jail was in lockdown, when incarcerated people often spend 23 hours per day in their cells. The months before, during, and after Thomas’s death, it was the same. Including January, the jail was on lockdown for eight months in 2022. According to a Pittsburgh City Paper, Black Pittsburgh, and Garrison Project analysis of the jail’s reports, outside of the lockdowns, in the second half of 2021 alone there were over 37,000 episodes where a person was held in a cell for a minimum of 20 hours, which amounted to over 84,500 days in solitary. Since the 2021 Allegheny County voter referendum to end solitary confinement within the jail took effect on Jan. 1, 2022, there have been 688 episodes that totaled over 1786 days in solitary. In every instance, the jail invoked “safety” as the reason for the solitary confinement. In 2022, the jail attributed its solitary confinement decisions to “medical” causes in nearly every case and also almost always invoked the COVID-19 pandemic. Allegheny County Jail refers to solitary confinement as segregated housing, and sometimes locks two people in the same cell for over 20 hours a day for multiple days. Similar to the jail’s general population — where 66% of the people incarcerated are Black compared to a county population that’s around 13% Black — since July 1, 2021, roughly two thirds of the people held in solitary have been Black. “The supervising staff–whoever is reading this, I want you to lock yourself or imagine being locked in your bathroom for 23 hours,” wrote a respondent to a 2021 jail survey by the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Social Work. “I been locked in my cell with no running water for 36 hours. Having to use the restroom on top of another man's waste is humiliating,” wrote another respondent to a 2022 survey conducted by the Pennsylvania Prison Society. Experts say the continued use of solitary on individuals and on the entire jail through lockdowns contradict the will of the county's voters who overwhelmingly supported the 2021 measure to end solitary confinement. “Nobody's enforcing that law right now,” said Gregory Dober, a healthcare ethics advocate and advisor at Pitt’s Center for Bioethics & Health Law. In his experience, wardens often employ lockdowns and solitary confinement when they run into staffing trouble, because such actions lighten the workload of corrections officers. “How does he get away with it? Well, it's called the Jail Oversight Board. If the oversight board is not criticizing him or saying enough is enough, who else does anything?” Representatives from the jail declined to be interviewed and did not respond to the details presented in this story with a list of questions. Over the years, the jail’s use of solitary has been targeted in lawsuits against the county and warden Orlando Harper. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Warden Orlando Harper Jules Williams, a Black transgender woman, was arrested on Sept. 30, 2015 and taken to the Allegheny County Jail. She has been receiving hormone treatments since she was 18 years old, and, at the time, had undergone gender-affirming medical care. But the jail housed Williams with men because she had “both male and female parts,” according to a lawsuit Williams filed in 2017 with the ACLU-PA in the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas. She requested segregated housing for her protection. The jail granted her request, but placed her in a solitary confinement cell with Djamal Eleam, a convicted sex offender who had made headlines weeks earlier because the jail mistakenly released him. Eleam allegedly raped Williams repeatedly over the next four days before jail staff removed him from the cell. Even after Eleam was separated from Williams, she told her public defender that jail staff forced her to shower with men, some of whom would come to her cell at night and masturbate on her. In December 2016, five women filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the jail, Harper, and others because they were held in solitary confinement while they were pregnant. In November of that year, Jill Hendricks, who was eight months pregnant, was placed in solitary confinement for nine days, during which she was only let out of her cell once, for one hour, on Thanksgiving Day. In May 2016, Mersiha Tuzlic, who was two months pregnant, was placed in solitary confinement for 22 days. She filed a grievance with Harper on her 11th day of confinement, stating that she had a pregnancy classified as high-risk, and wanted at least one hour of recreation outside of her cell. She received a response weeks later. Her grievance was dismissed by someone who wrote over her statement, “If this is a problem don’t come to jail.” In October, she was sent to solitary again for another 11 days. In September 2020, five people with severe mental illness filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the jail, Harper, and others alleging they were placed in solitary confinement for long periods of time, tased, and strapped into restraint chairs. The pregnant women reached a settlement with the county, Harper, and other defendants in late 2017 for $90,000 and changes to the jail’s policy. Williams settled her case for $300,000 in 2022. The case with the plaintiffs who suffer from mental illness is still ongoing. Two of their experts reviewed defendant depositions, jail policies, case files for a representative sample of incarcerated people with mental illness, among other jail documents. The experts cited aggressive use of force by jail staff, a lack of appropriate health care and health staffing, and the repeated use of segregated housing despite the 2021 referendum. “The measures taken by Allegheny County to avoid solitary do no such thing,” wrote Bradford Hansen, a former warden with more than 42 years of corrections experience. “This violates all applicable correctional standards and is objectively unreasonable.” “Dysfunction, breakdown, and basic provision of care” According to data maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC), the Allegheny County Jail had the highest number of documented use of force incidents — 455 — out of all Pennsylvania county jails in 2021. Since 2020, medical staff vacancies have soared to 88 unfilled positions out of a budgeted 162. And even though some positions have been temporarily filled through staffing agencies, 23% still need to be filled. The jail’s chief medical director was also recently reassigned without a permanent replacement in place. In fall 2020, Janet Bunts, a health services administrator for the jail, quit her job after just three months. In December 2020, she told the Tribune-Review that her bosses were not providing proper medical care to incarcerated people. “Correctional medicine is not for everybody,” Bunts said. “It’s going to take effective leadership to change that place.” Last spring, the jail’s corrections officers’ union contemplated a no-confidence vote in Harper, and in the summer, the union’s president filed a complaint that he was being targeted for speaking out about the jail’s problems. A 2021 ACJ survey of 1,418 incarcerated people by the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Social Work found that two thirds were dissatisfied with the medical care they received, with some saying they did not receive proper care or treatment. In 2022, the Pennsylvania Prison Society used prison-issued tablets to collect 330 responses to a health care survey. More than half of the respondents who requested medical services said they had not received health care. “Neither a staff crisis nor the health crisis is an excuse that people's basic constitutional rights should not be respected and maintained,” Noah Barth, the Pennsylvania Prison Society’s prison monitoring director, said. “When you have a situation where over half of the respondents are saying they've requested medical care and have not received it, that points to dysfunction, breakdown, and basic provision of care. And that should be a deep concern to the warden and anybody else looking at the jail.” Unannounced visits conducted by two members of the Jail Oversight Board on Oct. 27 and Nov. 14, 2022 also found medical staff complaints and long waits for medical care. “Unfortunately, many people in the ACJ come from vulnerable populations, and many bring with them serious medical conditions that have not been properly treated for extended periods,”Harper wrote in a response to the 2022 Prison Society survey. In an op-ed published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in July 2022, Harper lamented that the public wasn’t hearing the jail’s success stories. “The only news that gets coverage at the jail is bad news,” he wrote. The same day Harper’s op-ed was published, an incarcerated person died in his jail. It was the fourth in-custody death that year. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Juana Saunders dresses in white Aug. 4 in protest of Common Pleas Judge Anthony Mariani's alleged misconduct. “It’s not fair to my family” While the average number of incarcerated people at the Allegheny County jail dropped by almost 1,000 at the outset of the pandemic, deaths have grown substantially. From 2020 to 2022, at least 17 incarcerated people died at the jail, compared to just 10 in the three years prior. According to a report by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care released last month that examined each of the incidents, the death rate for the jail since 2020 is nearly three times the average mortality for local jails across the United States. The six deaths at the jail in 2022 put its death rate above the much larger and infamous Rikers Island Jail Complex in New York City for last year. Staff surveyed in the report said medical training, and, especially, CPR training were major concerns, along with communication of critical medical incidents “specifically deaths and suicides, or follow up or corrective information.” The report also noted that “three of the findings had causes of death that were not explained by the documentation provided.” This included a man who died of a ruptured spleen, a man who died of blunt force trauma to the head, and another who died from asphyxiation where “the autopsy found the manner of this death undetermined.” In that case, the jail attributed the man’s death to him choking on food, although the corrections sergeant turned off his body camera before entering his cell, so the report’s team could not confirm the circumstances of the incident. On March 2, people gathered at the Allegheny County Courthouse for a monthly Jail Oversight Board meeting. Harper sat with his back to the public as each person spoke about conditions of confinement at his jail. Many mentioned the low quality health care. One speaker played audio of a man who said he was put in solitary weeks ago. “The hole? That’s the dog kennel,” said the man in the recording. “They’ll send you in there for anything.” Juana Saunders, Gerald Thomas’s mother, spoke towards the end of public comment. “We don’t know if my son’s life would have been spared or not. But what we do know is that he died in the Allegheny County Jail,” Saunders, who was dressed in all white, said from the podium. As she spoke her voice rose in anger and she jabbed her finger at the board to take action. Last month, Saunders said that she’ll sometimes cry for hours when she thinks of her son, and still has trouble visiting his grave. She spent over $8,000 burying her son near her father and niece, who both died during the past four years. On Feb. 25, Saunders, through an advocate with the Abolitionist Law Center, started a GoFundMe in the hopes of raising money to put a headstone on his plot. “Y’all need to get on your job and make this man do what he need to do,” she said during the Jail Oversight Board meeting, pointing at Harper, “because they are killing people inside that jail, and they’re pushing the bodies out the door. And it’s not fair to me, it’s not fair to my family, it’s not fair to all the other families of people who died in that jail.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags News, Allegheny County Jail, Gerald Thomas Related Content A consent order brings the Allegheny County Jail close to wide-reaching mental healthcare changes By James Paul Mar 19, 2024 A forgotten 1909 incident shows how Pittsburgh has — and hasn't — moved on from racialized violence By David S.

Now stewarded by the Pittsburgh-based National Opera House nonprofit, the structure at 7101 Apple St. in Homewood that once served as NNOC's headquarters has been stabilized but still needs significant repairs to reopen. “AARP listed us as the No. 1 site to see before it’s gone,” NOH executive director Jonnet Solomon told Pittsburgh City Paper. Solomon and her late friend Miriam White purchased the house in 2000. She said the most urgent matter for the nonprofit is replacing the house’s roof. The building had been previously named one of the “most endangered” historic sites nationwide. “Stabilization doesn't last forever. It gets stabilized and then immediately, with weather, it starts deteriorating,” Solomon said. “And so, with the event at the City-County building, we're saying this is a perfect time to get the building restored.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein 7101 Apple St. during stabilization in 2023 The restoration process has faced a variety of roadblocks. Following the “endangered” designation by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, confusion about the house’s history led Solomon to withdraw a state-reviewed application for National Register of Historic Places status. The application was pulled for revisions, including a better accounting of the house’s relationship to the locally famous Harris family, who owned the house and rented space to Dawson during the NNOC’s formative years. The withdrawal affected the NOH’s ability to receive different streams of grant funding and damaged some local relationships. Estimates to restore the house have also risen as the scope of the work becomes clear. Solomon acknowledges the setbacks but remains focused on completing the project, which she expects will cost about $10 million. “Yes, it took away millions of dollars in funding at the time,” Solomon says of the decision to pull the NRHP application, “but at the end of the day, when anyone looks in the archives of this project, every step of it will be done correctly.” click to enlarge CP Photo: David S. Rotenstein The interior of 7101 Apple St. during stabilization NOH has, in recent years, taken pains to connect with the Harris family and others familiar with the mansion’s history. With a clearer timeframe and renewed sense of purpose, the organization is now focused on making a case that the house is worth saving. “When you fuse the stories, the history, the impact, the memories, the love, the joy, all of the things that come with that building, it changes your perspective on a particular structure,” NOH board president Khalif Ali told the City-County Building crowd on Feb. 3. “So we’re very happy to be here to honor the memory, the legacy, all of the experiences and the impact of the National Negro Opera House.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Artifacts from NNOC on display inside the City-County Building on Feb. 3, 2025 By all indications, the city supports the efforts. Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, through acting communications director Cydney Cooper, honored the efforts of Solomon, Ali, and others by proclaiming Feb. 3, 2025 National Negro Opera Company and National Opera House Day. The event also featured a performance by a steel-pan jazz band led by drummer Roger Humphries and a performance by Pittsburgh Opera resident artist Lauryn Davis. “As we all know, February is Black History Month,” Cooper told the audience. “Mary [Cardwell Dawson] saw an opportunity. She saw the need to create opportunities for African American opera singers at a time when our talents and gifts weren't valued or recognized, and, at a time of discriminatory housing, the National Negro Opera Company provided a safe space for African American artists.” click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Jonnet Solomon (left) and Khalif Ali hold up Mayor Ed Gainey's proclamation of National Negro Opera Company and National Opera House Day Amid applause, WAMO DJ KiKi Brown, who emceed the event, reminded the audience not to view the City-County Building exhibit as a one-off. “The celebration gets a little louder today, starting today, but let's not allow the applause and the appreciation to go down to a whisper,” she said. “Let's continue to apply this amazing effort to continue to bring legacy and life to Pittsburgh. It started here. We need to keep it here.” Solomon is hopeful that the artifacts on display, which include framed programs from NNOC performances and photographs of concerts and the house, give locals a sense of urgency about restoring it to its glory when the Apple St. home teemed with activity and hosted the likes of Duke Ellington and Roberto Clemente. “I would like people to take away the importance of preservation,” she told CP. “That's the key thing and the importance of contributing — to make sure things are preserved in the right way so that history is told in a way that connects everyone.” “I want people to see [that], when you tell a full story and you connect all of us, then it allows all of us to see ourselves in the past.” David S.
