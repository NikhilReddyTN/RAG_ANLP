Humility and pride find a balance at PGH Print Ship as lifelong printmaker Josh Snider and partners Brittany Sipe and Brandon Hooven offer something large corporations cannot: printing with love. The trio share a thankfulness for every order and knowledge that each customer brings an opportunity that builds onto the next. Understanding that work ethic means the better they do, the better their customers do. The ability to turn down work when they can’t meet a deadline or scrap an order and start over if they see they can do better.If you're familiar with the industrious history of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, it should come as no surprise that the local community still celebrates hard work, done well. PGH Print Ship is no exception as they produce dozens of orders every day, are consistently improving on their online ordering system, and have innovative automation that allows for wholesale pricing.Celebrating over a decade in business, their attention to detail and thirst for perfection have earned them nearly ten thousand customers including internationally recognized museums, galleries, artists, and photographers. PGH Print Ship supports many local arts-based organizations like The New Pittsburgh Exposition Magazine and Redfishbowl.ILFORD, an iconic name in the photography industry has honored PGH Print Ship as a certified printer partner. PGH Print Ship is grateful to be recognized as a Certified Print Lab by Canson, another prestigious brand that traces back to 1557 in France. Renowned for its fine art paper, Canson has been favored by legendary artists such as Picasso, Degas, and Van Gogh. Hahnemühle, the inventor of Fine Art InkJet Paper honors PGH Print Ship with a Studio Gold membership in their Digital FineArt Printing Excellence Program. Moab and Red River have added PGH Print Ship as one of their trusted Print Service Providers.Although these paper companies are hundreds of years old, ten or fewer printing businesses in America have received these prestigious recognitions from all five; an honor that can only be earned by consistently delivering top-quality prints. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRINTING & PROCESSESFor fine art reproductions and photo prints, we use five Canon Pro-2100, Pro-4100, and Pro-6100 wide-format printers with capabilities of printing up to 60” wide. Printing simultaneously in RGB and CMYK color modes via our 12-color system. This advanced system produces rich and vivid colors up to 1000x more colors than machines that only print in CMYK mode. Because of this, our prints challenge any fine art or photography printer in the professional printing market. The range and depth of colors are sure to wow both the harshest critics and curators.Our copy center boasts two top-of-the-line commercial quality production copiers with attached booklet-makers for hole punching, stapling, and bookbinding. Both the Konica Minolta AccurioPress c2060 and Canon imagePRESS Lite C165 have top-notch quality and the resolution and colors are stunning. Regardless of the printing method, we aim to be forward-thinking about our materials, our equipment, and the effect they have on our environment. We use FSC-certified materials, recycled materials, or sustainably resourced materials whenever possible. Bulk offset printing is done with soy-based inks. Copier printing is done with either environmentally friendly wax-based toner in the Konica Minolta or the Canon which uses toner with a low melting point that helps minimize power requirements and reduces energy use during warm-up and while on standby. We recycle all of our paper scraps and misprints. All of our printers are ENERGY STAR® certified. Our Canon copier is rated EPEAT Gold and offers a low Typical Electricity Consumption (TEC) rating. Our fine art reproduction machines use aqueous water-based inks, you can rest assured each giclée print is archival and environmentally friendly.We’re able to have such a diverse product selection due to the combination of our team’s experience across an array of printing methods in addition to partnerships with local and national printers, binders, and mailing houses.Our in-house production machines allow us to print quickly, without any setup time or costs. Additionally, we have the necessary equipment to trim, bind, score, perforate, fold, laminate, hole punch, and number. We also collaborate with other local print shops that specialize in particular methods that may cater specifically to your needs. We partner with large nationwide trade-only print houses (these are volume-based printing businesses that do not sell to the public) that give us wholesale pricing because we provide them with continuous work. We carefully vet who we partner with for their standards in printing and workplace environment before we call their work our own. Because of these partnerships, we can offer pricing that is competitive with nearly any local printer or national website you can find."

You can now download your new Privacy PolicyFrequently Asked Questions What is a Privacy Policy?Privacy policies are important legal statements written to clearly communicate the means by which your platform collects, stores, shares, uses, and protects your users’ information. Any time you interact with personal data from users, no matter whether it is on an app, website, desktop program, or otherwise, you must provide a privacy policy document that details this interaction. The ultimate goal of any privacy policy is to ensure that the business issuing it adheres to electronic privacy laws in their state or country. Most privacy policies strive to be as thorough as possible, explaining how cookies and other trackers are implemented on websites and apps that may interact with or store users’ personal information. Your privacy policy should also detail the measures your business takes to adhere closely to both industry standards and ethical principles. Plus, your privacy policy can inform your users about their privacy rights and how they can change their specific preferences regarding the collection and usage of their data. What is Personal Information?Privacy policies revolve almost entirely around the collection and usage of the personal information of users on a specific platform. This personal information may include but is not limited to: Full Names Physical Addresses Email Addresses Social Media Handles Phone Numbers Government ID Numbers Online Browsing History (Cookie Data) User-Generated Content Other Personally-Identifying Information (Health, Political Beliefs, Economic Status, Etc.) This personal information can be collected in a number of ways. For instance, users may have the option to create accounts on your website, sign up for your newsletter, post comments, leave reviews, or make purchases. All of these interactions leave behind a data trail that can be used to personally identify the individual that performed them. Why do I need a Privacy Policy?Simply put, you need a privacy policy to avoid breaking the laws of many countries and regions around the world. No matter where your business is located on the planet, you will need to utilize a privacy policy to avoid violating privacy guidelines in specific regions from which your users access your site. However, governments and regulatory bodies aren’t the only parties that expect a privacy policy – these days, consumers also expect to see them on your website or app. In general, consumers have become more concerned about their private information and how it is used by the businesses and other online entities they interact with. Including a privacy policy demonstrates your legitimacy as a trustworthy business as well as your inclinations toward professionalism and honesty. Is Privacy Policy required?There are many laws created to require privacy policies around the world, including: GDPR: European Union General Data Protection Regulation CalOPPA: California Online Privacy Protection Act CCPA: California Consumer Privacy Act PIPEDA: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act No matter where your business is located, potential customers will be able to access your website from the majority of regions with Internet access. Even if your website is operated out of the European Union, many of your users may be located in the United States. If you collect data from those users, your privacy policy must also include clauses that meet the CalOPPA or CCPA requirements. What must be included in Privacy Policy?Generally, your privacy policy should cover the types of personal information you collect, the ways you collect that information, why you collect it, how it will be stored and used, and how users can opt out or alter the way their information is collected and used. If you are in a region with highly specific privacy laws, you must include every element required in your privacy policy for it to adhere to those laws and the guidelines they establish. The most thorough privacy policies will include the following: Website Information – Contact information (phone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses) as well as information about the purpose of the website. Data Collection and Processing Information – How your website collects user data, such as through forms, tags, cookies, third-party services, and more. This section should also make users aware of where and for how long their data will be stored. Data Protection and User Rights Information – Details about users’ rights, and how they can contact you to exercise those rights. You may inform users about the specific safety measures your business has taken to protect their data. Privacy Policy Updates or Changes – Any time you make changes or revisions to your privacy policy to reflect new services or features of your business or your website. You may include an effective date so users know when these changes went into effect. Can I copy Privacy Policy from another website?Websites should always generate their own privacy policies to avoid copyright disputes and providing inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information. Acting with caution concerning legal compliance and with respect to customers’ privacy should always be a priority for businesses and website operators. Since privacy policies are legal documents, they can protect you against lawsuits or accusations of violating privacy laws and guidelines. Your website or application’s privacy policy must take into account the specific ways you collect user information, the third-party services you work with, and the laws that apply to your business website in the regions where it can be accessed. Don’t break the law. Instead, create your own privacy policy from scratch or use CookieScript Privacy Policy Generator to simplify the process. Why use CookieScript Privacy Policy Generator?CookieScript Privacy Policy Generator offers a comprehensive set of features so your website or app can create a privacy policy that will ensure your compliance with privacy laws around the world. These features include: Unique Cookie Declaration (Cookie Policy) for Your Website: Declare the cookies that are active on your website to your users, what data they track, why they are active, and where the data they collect is stored and sent. Third-Party Services Selection: Choose from a list of third-party services that are active on your website to easily generate a privacy policy that accurately represents your website and its partnerships. Pre-Defined Third-Party Services and Options: Include more unique third-party services and options to better inform your customers of how your website operates. Intuitive Customization For All Lists: Customize every element of your privacy policy to ensure a detailed and comprehensive privacy policy, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Compatibility with Privacy Laws Like GDPR and CCPA: Adhere to both the EU and US online privacy laws with our options for customizing your privacy policy based on the regions you serve.
