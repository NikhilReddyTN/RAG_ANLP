Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like... MYTH: I'LL HAVE TO WEAR A TUXEDO OR A FANCY BALL GOWN Come as you are or glam it up! On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable! Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman) MYTH: BUT IT'S SOOOOO EXPENSIVE! Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn! There are even discounts for groups of 6+, students, 20-Something Tuesdays and more. MYTH: I WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word! MYTH: OPERA IS BORING! Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings? Operas have these in spades! That's why the term \"operatic\" has come to mean \"dramatic to the nth degree.\" These two will slice your notions of \"boring\" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman) MYTH: OPERAS ARE TOO LONG Operas come in all shapes and sizes! The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way. MYTH: ALL OPERA SOUNDS THE SAME Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too! While almost all operas make use of \"classical voice technique,\" which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop! We Shall Not Be Moved lays down fresh beats (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some playful 18th century coluratura from Semele (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations) A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations) MYTH: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PhD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie! Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to the Pre Opera Talk, Meet The Artists, or pick up a Study Guide at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening! MYTH: OPERAS ARE ALWAYS DEPRESSING Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too. While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones! Who doesn't love a happy ending?

During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to Bitz Opera Factory in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note. Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. Our Beginnings Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianist Virginia C. Byerly; contralto Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey; Priscilla W. Collins; Ruby N. Wickersham; and Marie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States. The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was The Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor, Richard Karp of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983, Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera. Mark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company’s assets threefold and cemented the Opera’s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region. Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and John Mauceri as Music Director in 2001. Our New Home In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company’s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011. In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its educational events annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Program is among the country’s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free community Song Shop Concerts to concert recitals by world-class opera singers. Pittsburgh Opera’s long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

We have long been committed to making opera accessible to a diverse audience, but we recognize that a more focused outlook is necessary to ensure that our organization reflects the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA), in our public offerings as well as internally. Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect - respect for all stories, voices, experiences, and contributions. We aim to reflect this culture both through our leadership structure, programming choices, and employment policies, as well as through our interactions with our audience and the larger community. We recognize and celebrate the rich cultural history of opera while also acknowledging that the classic repertoire is largely European and does not include the perspective or experience of many marginalized communities. Because of this history, it has been especially essential that Pittsburgh Opera recognizes these biases and continues to bring more diverse voices both to our stage and to our staff. For many years, Pittsburgh Opera has provided a platform for contemporary works on the main stage as well as part of our Second Stage Project. Through world premieres such as 2017’s The Summer King, about baseball legend Josh Gibson, and productions of As One and 27, we continue to showcase work by diverse composers and librettists, sung by diverse artists, and supported by a diverse artistic and administrative staff. In addition, Pittsburgh Opera embraces a continued commitment to growth and conversation, as outlined by the following principles: Inclusion: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to fostering an environment of mutual respect and a culture that values individual voices. Diversity: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to encouraging diversity, and to engaging the larger community in order to ensure that our organization reflects the population we serve. Equity: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to implementing policies of equity to ensure an even playing field for all. Accessibility: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to integrating accessibility principles at all levels, ensuring that those with visual, physical, sensory, or other accessibility needs can experience opera without barriers.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia.

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death.La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT.

In their Latin Quarter garret on Christmas Eve, the painter Marcello and poet Rodolfo try to keep warm by burning pages from Rodolfo's latest drama. They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina \"What a cold little hand\") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì \"Yes, they call me Mimì\"), embroidering flowers and waiting for spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla \"Oh lovely girl\"). ACT II. Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the elderly, wealthy Alcindoro. Trying to regain the painter's attention, she sings a waltz about her popularity (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns. ACT III. At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì walks by, searching for the place where the reunited Marcello and Musetta now live. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, she says. Rodolfo, who has been asleep in the tavern, is heard, and Mimì hides; Marcello thinks she has left. The poet tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). The painter and his mistress part in fury, but Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. ACT IV. Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra \"Old coat\"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? \"Have they gone?\"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name. -Courtesy of Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.

Written in the style of monastic plain song and laden with musical symbolism, this piece artfully melds theatrical simplicity with ecumenical grandeur.In keeping with these themes and this opera’s history, Curlew River will be staged at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside. Antony Walker conducts; Dana Kinney directs. PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: Calvary Episcopal Church, Shadyside When: Saturday, January 24, 2026 * 7:00 PM Tuesday, January 27, 2026 * 7:00 PM Friday, January 30, 2026 * 7:00 PM Sunday, February 1, 2026 * 4:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM The Ferryman: Erik Nordstrom* The Madwoman: Logan Wagner* The Abbot: Matthew Soibelman* The Traveler: Yazid Gray** Conductor: Antony Walker Stage Director: Dana Kinney* + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Alumnus SYNOPSIS The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant “Te lucis ante terminum.” The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God’s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman’s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy’s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost. She leads the lamentation, in which all join, her prayers mingling with images of birds and flight. A child’s voice is heard and the Spirit of the Child appears above the tomb. He blesses his mother with the promise that they will meet in Heaven. The Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller resume their monks’ habits and all recss chanting the “Te lucis.” – Hugh Macdonald, Mark Morris Dance Group DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Beloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he drunkenly schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. However, when these women uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget! The music matches the merriment and mischief of this madcap romp. See why Verdi’s buoyant comedy, based on Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor, is considered one of the best comedic operas of all time!Antony Walker conducts; Crystal Manich directs. These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

Dr. Caius bursts into Sir John Falstaff’s room in the Garter Inn, accusing him of unseemly behavior the previous night. He further accuses Falstaff’s two henchmen, Bardolph and Pistol, of having robbed him while he was drunk. Unable to obtain reparations, Dr. Caius leaves in a fury. Falstaff contemplates the large bill he has run up at the inn. He informs Bardolph and Pistol that in order to repair his finances he plans to seduce Alice Ford and Meg Page, both wives of prosperous Windsor citizens. When Bardolph and Pistol refuse to deliver the letters Falstaff has written to the two ladies, Falstaff instructs a page to do so instead. He then ridicules Bardolph and Pistol’s newly discovered sense of honor, before throwing them out of his room. The Garter Inn. Alice Ford and Meg Page laugh over the identical love letters they have received from Sir John Falstaff. They share their amusement with Alice’s daughter Nannetta, and with their friend Mistress Quickly. Ford arrives, followed by four men all proffering advice: Dr. Caius, whom Ford favors as Nannetta’s future husband; Bardolph and Pistol, who are now seeking advantageous employment from Ford; and Fenton, who is in love with Ford’s daughter Nannetta. When Ford learns of Falstaff’s plan to seduce his wife, he immediately becomes jealous. While Alice and Meg plan how to take revenge on their importunate suitor, Ford decides to disguise himself in order to pay a visit to Falstaff. Unnoticed in the midst of all the commotion, Nannetta and Fenton manage to steal a few precious moments together. ACT II The Garter Inn. Feigning penitence, Bardolph and Pistol rejoin Falstaff’s service. They show in Mistress Quickly, who informs Falstaff that both Alice and Meg are madly in love with him. She explains that it will be easier to seduce Alice, since her husband is out of the house every afternoon, between two and three. Falstaff joyously anticipates his seduction of Alice. Bardolph now announces that a “Mister Brook” (Ford in disguise) wishes to speak to Falstaff. To Falstaff’s surprise, “Brook” offers him wine and money if he will seduce Alice Ford, explaining that he has long been in love with the lady, but to no avail. If she were to be seduced by the more experienced Falstaff, she might then be more likely to fall a second time and accept “Brook.” Falstaff agrees to the plan, telling his surprised new friend that he already has a rendezvous with Alice that very afternoon. As Falstaff leaves to prepare himself, Ford gives way to jealous rage. When Falstaff returns, dressed in his best clothes, the two men exchange compliments before leaving together. Ford’s house. Mistress Quickly, Alice and Meg are preparing for Falstaff’s visit. Nannetta tearfully tells her mother that her father insists on her marrying Dr. Caius, but Alice tells her daughter not to worry. Falstaff arrives and begins his seduction of Alice, nostalgically boasting of his aristocratic youth as page to the Duke of Norfolk. As Falstaff becomes more amorous, Meg Page interrupts the tête-à-tête, as planned, to announce (in jest) that Ford is approaching. But just at that point Mistress Quickly suddenly returns in a panic to inform Alice that Ford really is on his way, and in a jealous temper. As Ford rushes in with a group of townsfolk, the terrified Falstaff seeks a hiding place, eventually ending up in a large laundry basket. Fenton and Nannetta also hide. Ford and the other men ransack the house. Hearing the sound of kissing, Ford is convinced that he has found his wife and her lover Falstaff together, but is furious to discover Nannetta and Fenton instead. While Ford argues with Fenton, Alice instructs her servants to empty the laundry basket out of the window. To general hilarity, Falstaff is thrown into the River Thames. ACT III Outside the Garter Inn. A wet and bruised Falstaff laments the wickedness of the world, but soon cheers up with a glass of mulled wine. Mistress Quickly persuades him that Alice was innocent of the unfortunate incident at Ford’s house. To prove that Alice still loves him, she proposes a new rendezvous that night in Windsor Great Park. In a letter that Quickly gives to Falstaff, Alice asks the knight to appear at midnight, disguised as the Black Huntsman. Ford, Nannetta, Meg, and Alice prepare the second part of their plot: Nannetta will be Queen of the Fairies and the others, also in disguise, will help to continue Falstaff’s punishment. Ford secretly promises Caius that he will marry Nannetta that evening. Mistress Quickly overhears them. Windsor Great Park. As Fenton and Nannetta are reunited, Alice explains her plan to trick Ford into marrying them. They all hide as Falstaff approaches. On the stroke of midnight, Alice appears. She declares her love for Falstaff, but suddenly runs away, saying that she hears spirits approaching. Nannetta, disguised as the Queen of the Fairies, summons her followers who attack the terrified Falstaff, pinching and poking him until he promises to give up his dissolute ways. In the midst of the assault Falstaff suddenly recognizes Bardolph, and realizes that he has been tricked. While Ford explains that he was “Brook,” Quickly scolds Falstaff for his attempts at seducing two younger, virtuous women. Falstaff accepts that he has been made a figure of fun, but points out that he remains the real source of wit in others. Dr. Caius now comes forward with a figure in white. They are to be married by Ford. Alice brings forward another couple, who also receive Ford’s blessing. When the brides remove their veils it is revealed that Ford has just married Fenton to Nannetta, and Dr. Caius to Bardolph. With everyone now laughing at his expense, Ford has no choice but to forgive the lovers and bless their marriage. Before sitting down to a wedding supper with Sir John Falstaff, the entire company agrees that the whole world may be nothing but a jest filled with jesters, but he who laughs last, laughs best. — Metropolitan Opera DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

SYNOPSIS ACT I Seville. Count Almaviva comes in disguise to the house of Doctor Bartolo and serenades Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps confined to the house. Figaro the barber, who knows all the town’s secrets and scandals, explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo’s ward, not his daughter, and that the doctor intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be quartered at Bartolo’s house so that he may gain access to Rosina. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash pay-off. Rosina reflects on the voice that has enchanted her and resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet the man it belongs to—as Almaviva has led her to believe, a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina’s music master, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen in Seville. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Basilio suggests slander as the most effective means of getting rid of Almaviva. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger’s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from billeting soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered in the street, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the house. The civil guard bursts in to arrest Almaviva, but when he secretly reveals his true identity to the captain he is instantly released. Everyone except Figaro is amazed by this turn of events. ACT II Bartolo suspects that the “soldier” was a spy planted by Almaviva. The count returns, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a music teacher and student of Don Basilio, to give Rosina her singing lesson in place of Basilio, who, he says, is ill at home. “Don Alonso” then tells Bartolo that when visiting Almaviva at his inn, he found a letter from Rosina. He offers to tell her that it was given to him by another woman, seemingly to prove that Lindoro is toying with Rosina on Almaviva’s behalf. This convinces Bartolo that “Don Alonso” is indeed a student of the scheming Basilio, and he allows him to give Rosina her lesson. With Bartolo dozing off, Almaviva and Rosina declare their love. Figaro arrives to give Bartolo his shave and manages to snatch the key that opens the doors to Rosina’s balcony. Suddenly Basilio shows up looking perfectly healthy. Almaviva, Rosina, and Figaro convince him with a quick bribe that he is in fact ill and must go home at once. While Bartolo gets his shave, Almaviva plots with Rosina to meet at her balcony that night so that they can elope. But the doctor overhears them and realizing he has been tricked again, flies into a rage. Everyone disperses. The maid Berta comments on the crazy household. Bartolo summons Basilio, telling him to bring a notary so Bartolo can marry Rosina that very night. Bartolo then shows Rosina her letter to Lindoro, as proof that he is in league with Almaviva. Heartbroken and convinced that she has been deceived, Rosina agrees to marry Bartolo. A thunderstorm passes. Figaro and the count climb a ladder to Rosina’s balcony and let themselves in with the key. Rosina appears and confronts Lindoro, who finally reveals his true identity as Almaviva. Basilio shows up with the notary. Bribed and threatened, he agrees to be a witness to the marriage of Rosina and Almaviva. Bartolo arrives with soldiers, but it is too late. He accepts that he has been beaten, and Figaro, Rosina, and the count celebrate their good fortune.

Every seven years a ghostly ship pulls into port captained by a man known simply as The Dutchman. Condemned to eternally roam the seven seas, only the pure heart of a faithful bride can free The Dutchman from a demonic curse. In a windswept fishing village, he finds Senta, a young woman obsessed with his dark legend. But can this match made in heaven truly save him from his hellish fate? Wagner’s thunderous score brings this haunting tale to life with all the power of a stormy and turbulent sea. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to present Wagner’s sweeping epic The Flying Dutchman for the first time in over 20 years. Sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

SYNOPSIS ACT I The Norwegian coast, 19th century. A storm has driven Daland’s ship several miles from his home. Sending his crew off to rest, he leaves the watch in charge of a young steersman, who falls asleep as he sings about his girl. A ghostly schooner drops anchor next to Daland’s ship. Its captain steps ashore and, with increasing despair, reflects on his fate: once every seven years he may leave his ship to find a wife. If she is faithful, she will redeem him from his deathless wandering. If not, he is condemned to sail the ocean until Judgment Day. Daland discovers the phantom ship, and the stranger, who introduces himself as “a Dutchman,” tells him of his plight. The Dutchman offers gold and jewels for a night’s lodging, and when he learns that Daland has a daughter, asks for her hand in marriage. Happy to have found a rich son-in-law, Daland agrees and sets sail for home. ACT II Daland’s daughter, Senta, is captivated by the portrait of a pale man in black—the Flying Dutchman. Her friends, working under the watchful eye of Mary, Senta’s nurse, tease Senta about her suitor, Erik, who is a hunter, not a sailor. When the superstitious Mary refuses to sing a ballad about the Dutchman, Senta sings it herself. The song reveals that the Dutchman’s curse was put on him for a blasphemous oath. To everyone’s horror, Senta suddenly declares that she will be the woman to save him. Erik enters with news of the sailors’ return. Alone with Senta, he reminds her of her father’s wish to find her a husband and asks her to plead his cause, but she remains distant. Realizing how much the Dutchman’s picture means to her, he tells her of a frightening dream in which he saw her embrace the Dutchman and sail away on his ship. Senta declares that this is what she must do, and Erik rushes off in despair. A moment later, the Dutchman enters. Senta stands transfixed. Daland follows and asks his daughter to welcome the stranger, whom he has brought to be her husband. Daland leaves, and the Dutchman, who is equally moved by the meeting, asks Senta if she will accept him. Unaware that she realizes who he is, he warns her of making a rash decision, but she vows to be faithful to him unto death. Daland is overjoyed to learn that his daughter has accepted the suitor. ACT III At the harbor, the villagers celebrate the sailors’ return. Baffled by the strange silence aboard the Dutchman’s ship, they call out to the crew, inviting them to join the festivities. Suddenly the ghostly sailors appear, mocking their captain’s quest in hollow chanting. The villagers flee in terror. Quiet returns and Senta appears, followed by the distressed Erik. He pleads with her not to marry the Dutchman since she has already pledged her love to him. The Dutchman, who has overheard them, lets go of all hope and boards his ship. When Senta tries to stop him, he explains she will escape damnation—the fate of those who betray him—only because she has not yet proclaimed her vows before God. He reveals his identity and Senta ecstatically replies that she knows who he is. As his ship pulls away, she throws herself into the sea, faithful unto death. - Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review: onStage Pittsburgh: Rare Taste of Wagner’s Early Success Staged by Pittsburgh Opera in Brilliant Performance Review: Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Soars with Great Talent Broadway World: Photos: Get a First Look at Pittsburgh Opera THE FLYING DUTCHMAN Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review onStage Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Beloved Favorites, Rare Gems, and Free Concerts this Fall Opera Wire: Kyle Albertson Leads Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: November 2023 Theater Guide onStage Pittsburgh: What’s On Stage Pittsburgh for the week of October 30th, 2023 to the end of December Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Pittsburgh Opera's ghostly 'Flying Dutchman' sails into the Benedum Saturday NEXTpittsburgh: 10 things to do this weekend Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Fun things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend onStage Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera Offers Exclusive Interview with Bryan Register 90.5 WESA: WESA Arts newsletter, Nov. 8 WQED-FM 'Voice of the Arts Podcast' interviews: Maestro Antony Walker Stage Director Sam Helfrich Kyle Albertson (The Dutchman) Marjorie Owens (Senta) Bryan Register (Erik) David Bennett (Supernumerary) WESA.fm: What to do in Pittsburgh this weekend: Nov. 10-12 On State News - Penn State's Student Blog: What To Do In Pittsburgh Over Thanksgiving Break KDKA-TV: Pittsburgh Today Live - Weekend Guide: November 16, 2023 Tribune Review: 5 things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend - Nov. 17-19 VIDEO EXCERPTS Enjoy these video excerpts of our production of The Flying Dutchman.

But as Fate would have it, her brother Oreste is the first to be shipwrecked on the peninsula and brought to the sacrificial altar. The priestess believes her brother to be dead and responsible for the death of their mother. Oreste in turn believes that Iphigénie had been sacrificed to the goddess Diana by their father Agamemnon in return for favorable winds. The siblings fail to recognize each other yet Iphigénie feels a strange kinship with the ill-fated stranger. She wishes to spare him, but Oreste—driven mad by grief and guilt over his family’s compounding tragedy—welcomes death. Will they discover the truth before it is too late? Showcasing the transition from baroque to classical opera, Christoph Gluck reimagines Euripides’ great Greek drama and reignites it in true operatic form.

SYNOPSIS ACT I A storm batters Diane’s temple at Tauride. Iphigénie and the other priestesses—all of them captives from Greece—ask the gods for safety and peace from the storms raging both outside and within their hearts. Iphigénie relates a dream: her home was destroyed; her father was killed by her mother, Clytemnestre, who gave her a dagger; her brother Oreste cried out to her for help, but she was forced to kill him. The priestesses grieve with Iphigénie and urge her not to lose hope that she will see Oreste again, but she prays to Diane to end her life (“Ô toi qui prolongeas mes jours”). The Scythian king, Thoas, comes to Iphigénie in despair, followed everywhere by omens and voices calling for his downfall. Oracles have ordered him to sacrifice every stranger to the country to end his torment. His soldiers come with news of new captives—two Greek men—and Thoas orders Iphigénie to kill them on the altar. The Greeks are brought in: one is half-mad, haunted by past crimes, the other defies Thoas. They are imprisoned as the Scythians call for blood. ACT II The strangers are Oreste and his lifelong friend Pylade. Oreste, who has killed his mother and is being pursued by the Furies, lives on the edge of madness; now he feels responsible for Pylade’s imminent death (“Dieux qui me poursuivez”). Pylade calms Oreste with the pledge that they will die together (“Unis dès la plus tendre enfance”). Pylade is taken away, and Oreste sinks gradually into sleep (“La calme rentre dans mon cœur”). But the Furies stalk him even in his dreams. He awakens from a nightmare to find Iphigénie standing before him. Without revealing her identity she questions him about the royal family in Mycène, and he tells her all: Clytemnestre murdered Agamemnon to avenge the death of Iphigénie, Oreste struck down Clytemnestre to avenge his father and then, he adds, Oreste killed himself. Iphigénie sends the stranger to be shackled to the altar, and—now without country, kindred or hope—mourns the loss of her family (“Ô malheureuse Iphigénie”). Intermission ACT III Iphigénie feels a strong kinship for the prisoner (“D’une image, hélas!”). She resolves to save at least one of the captives and to send the survivor to Mycène with a letter for her sister, Electre. Pylade, who has been tortured, is reunited with Oreste, and Iphigénie tells them Oreste must live and carry the sealed letter (Trio: “Je pourrais du tyran”). Pylade is happy to die for his friend’s life (“Ah! mon ami”). Oreste, determined that he himself should die, seizes the sacrificial knife and threatens to take his own life if Iphigénie will not spare Pylade. Iphigénie gives Pylade the letter and helps him escape. ACT IV Iphigénie tries repeatedly to perform the sacrifice, but she cannot bring herself to harm the stranger and cries out angrily against Diane (“Je t’implore et je tremble”). Oreste is brought in (“Que ces regrets touchant”). Touched by Iphigénie’s sadness and her concern for him, he tries to encourage her to do her duty, calling out in the final moment, “Iphigénie, beloved sister, thus also did you perish at Aulide.” Sister and brother realize the truth. Thoas bursts in: Iphigénie’s plot has been discovered. He orders the Greek killed immediately and is about to sacrifice Oreste himself when Pylade returns with Greek soldiers to save his friend. Thoas is killed in the fray, which is halted when Diane herself appears to pardon Oreste, set the Greek women free, and send prince and princess home to Mycène—and the first happiness they have known since before the Greeks set sail for Troy.

A family of Nebraskan homesteaders in the 1870s dreams of \"proving up.\" They endeavor to obtain the deed to the land they've settled by fulfilling the requirements of the Homestead Act: five years of harvest, a sod house dwelling, and perhaps the most elusive element—a glass window. With their eldest son incapacitated, Ma and Pa send their youngest living child Miles on a mission to share the valuable commodity with their distant neighbors who are expecting a visit from a government inspector. Miles’ journey brings him face to face with the remnants of a shattered past—the ghost of a neighboring farmer driven mad by the requirements of \"proving up.\" The willowy figure knows all too well the cost of the American Dream, and the coveted window soon becomes a broken mirror reflecting great tragedy. “A tense and creepy journey into the heart of Manifest Destiny's darkness” – The New York Times \"Harrowing...powerful... a true opera of our time\" - The Washington Post (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: The Bitz Opera Factory (Pittsburgh Opera's headquarters), 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh's Strip District When: Saturday, February 17, 2024 * 8:00 PM Tuesday, February 20, 2024 * 7:00 PM Friday, February 23, 2024 * 7:30 PM Sunday, February 25, 2024 * 2:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM Miles Zegner: Fran Daniel Laucerica* Mrs. Johannes “Ma” Zegner: Emily Richter* Mr. Johannes “Pa” Zegner: Brandon Bell* Taller Zegner Sister: Julia Swan Laird* Littler Zegner Sister: Jazmine Olwalia* The Sodbuster: Evan Lazdowski* Peter Zegner: Mason Dowd+ Conductor: James LesniakStage Director: Haley Stamats* Set Designer: Brett RochfordCostume Designer: Nancy JulianLighting Designer: Todd NonnStage Manager: Claire YoungAssistant Conductor: Glenn LewisDirector of Musical Studies: Mark Trawka + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist alumni DETAILS & RESOURCES Four performances at the Bitz Opera Factory, 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Only the love of the doting Alfredo can sweep her away from these sensual delights. But while she is a trophy to be won amongst the balls and frivolities of Paris, she is nothing but a scandalous “fallen woman” to genteel society. Violetta and Alfredo’s love threatens to bring shame to his family and ruin his sister's marriage prospects. In secret, Alfredo’s father presses Violetta to shun Alfredo and save the family’s reputation. Heartbroken and health failing, Violetta retreats to her old life of empty pleasures. As her illness worsens, will love slip away as well? Verdi’s exquisite tragedy juxtaposes rousing numbers like the joyous Brindisi with heart-wrenching arias to create a shattering emotional portrait like no other. These performances are sponsored in part by a generous gift from Robert and Christine Pietrandrea, and by The Gailliot Fund.

Made available courtesy of Utah Symphony | Utah Opera SYNOPSIS Violetta Valéry is hosting a lively party at her beautiful Paris apartment. Flora arrives late with a small group and everyone sits for dinner. Gastone introduces Violetta to Alfredo Germont, an admirer who has long adored her from afar. Alfredo flirts with her in a rousing drinking song, the famous Brindisi “Libiamo ne’lieti calici”. Alfredo confesses to Violetta that he has loved her for more than a year. Moved, Violetta attempts to warn him, saying that she “doesn’t know how to love” but he is undeterred. Later, Violetta seriously considers his proposal but then vows that she wants to remain \"sempre libera\" - always free. Alfredo eventually wins Violetta over, and they move to a house in the country. Alfredo sings about how happy he has been ever since Violetta told him “I want to live, faithful to you alone.” However, Alfredo’s father Giorgio Germont disapproves of Violetta’s relationship with Alfredo, which threatens his family’s reputation and his daughter’s engagement. He coerces Violetta into breaking up with Alfredo, then returns to console his son. But Alfredo discovers that Violetta has gone to Flora's masquerade and he returns to Paris to confront her there. At the party, Violetta soon appears on the arm of the Baron, to whom she has returned in an effort to break permanently with Alfredo. After winning a great deal of money, Alfredo confronts Violetta. She lies and says that she no longer loves him, but loves the Baron instead. Enraged, Alfredo calls everyone to witness as he throws the money at Violetta. Germont chastises his son and the Baron challenges Alfredo to a duel. Several months later, Violetta, now destitute and abandoned, is dying of tuberculosis. In a letter she learns that Germont has finally confessed his plot to Alfredo, who is returning to reconcile with her. Their joyful reunion is soon overshadowed by her illness. Violetta bids farewell “to happy dreams of by-gone days.” Alfredo's father also returns with the Doctor, but it is too late.

Based on a true story. • April 27, 30 & May 3,5, 2024Byham Theater Pittsburgh’s unsung heroine who taught America to sing In 1943, the National Negro Opera Company is set to perform on a floating barge to evade racially-segregated venues. But when bad weather threatens—pushing the performance to a segregated performance hall—visionary impressaria Mary Cardwell Dawson must find a way forward. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s dream to provide access for African Americans to perform on stages for all audiences changed the future of opera. Having founded the longest-running, all-Black opera company here in Pittsburgh and organizing opera guilds in the country’s biggest cities, Mary Cardwell Dawson would go on to train hundreds of African American youth to sing. Written by Mark Twain Award-winning playwright and librettist Sandra Seaton, The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson celebrates the remarkable founder of Pittsburgh’s historic and groundbreaking National Negro Opera Company. This play with music includes selections from Carmen as well as original music by award-winning Kennedy Center Composer-in-Residence Carlos Simon.Commissioned by The Glimmerglass Festival (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: Byham Theater, 101 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 When: Saturday, April 27, 2024 * 8:00 PM Tuesday, April 30, 2024 * 7:00 PM Friday, May 3, 2024 * 7:30 PM Sunday, May 5, 2024 * 3:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM Mary Cardwell Dawson: Alyson Cambridge+ Frank: Christian Mark Gibbs+ Phoebe: Jazmine Olwalia* Isabelle: Meroë Khalia Adeeb+ Music Director / Pianist: Marvin Mills+Stage Director: Kimille Howard+Set Designer: James F.

SYNOPSIS: CONTAINS SPOILERS Synopsis - contains spoilers! Summer 1943. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s rehearsal studio. The National Negro Opera Company is preparing to present two operas at the outdoor Watergate Concert Barge in Washington, D.C. For the company’s ambitious schedule, La traviata was performed on the first night with the great soprano Madame Lillian Evanti. However, the damp weather was unsuitable, and the attendance was disappointing. Madame Mary Cardwell Dawson meets with the singers who will perform the leads in a planned performance of Carmen: Frank (Don José), Isabelle (Micaëla), and Phoebe (Carmen). Fearing the rain will again keep the audience away, Madame Dawson inquires about renting a concert hall. While the hall manager agrees to rent to the NNOC, he informs Madame Dawson that the venue has a policy of segregated seating. The future of the company hangs in the balance: according to the Union agreement, the artists and other personnel must be paid, whether the concert takes place or not. An outdoor performance in the rain is sure to be a disappointment, but an indoor performance with segregated seating is unacceptable. The young singers, eager to make their mark, urge Madame Dawson to consider the hall. She initially will not hear it, but as rehearsals continue and the weather worsens, she has moments of doubt. The Union board, expecting a breach of contract, demands she leave rehearsal for an emergency meeting. When they insult her, she fights back and is taken to jail. After Madame Dawson is bailed out, Madame Dawson returns to rehearsal, bruised but undaunted. The young singers realize that Madame Dawson’s life—her determination and struggle—is the greatest lesson she has for them. They tell her they will sing in the rain if necessary. Just as they resolve to go forward, the rain stops. -Courtesy of The Glimmerglass Festival PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review: onStage Pittsburgh - Dramady with Operatic Interludes Opens at the Byham Review: Tribune-Review - Pittsburgh Opera's 'Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson' is a performance to remember Review: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Operatic snapshot of a famous Pittsburgh singer sizzles with humor, drama Pittsburgh Magazine - Famous Opera Company Gets Its Own Opera Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Theater Guide April 2024 Pittsburgh Magazine - Things to Do in Pittsburgh This April The POP: The Pittsburgh Opera Podcast - THE PASSION OF MARY CARDWELL DAWSON - Artistic Coordinator Matthew Hrdlicka interviews Alyson Cambridge (Mary) and stage director Kimille Howard Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera's final show this season spotlights a local legend onStage Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera’s “The Passion of Mary Cadwell Dawson” Will Wrap Season 2023/24 KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh - \"Intersections\" April 21, 2024 (cast visit to National Opera House, starts at 16:30 of video) WESA-FM 90.5 - Play honors Pittsburgh's Black opera pioneer Mary Cardwell Dawson onStage Pittsburgh - 9 things to do this weekend in Pittsburgh WQED-FM Voice of the Arts Podcast interviews: Kimille Howard, stage director Christian Mark Gibbs, \"Frank\" Alyson Cambridge, \"Mary Cardwell Dawson\" Meroë Khalia Adeeb, \"Isabelle\" COMMUNITY EVENTS Join us for a series of FREE community events inspired by the life and legacy of Mary Cardwell Dawson: March 26: Family Day Event April 5: Opera Meets Jazz April 11: Honoring our Past, Connecting to our Present April 14: Panel Discussion 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

While it has many similarities to both the familiar Disney® movie and the Hans Christian Andersen story, they are not exactly the same. First of all, her name is Rusalka, not Ariel. Secondly, Rusalka is not a mermaid per se, but a water sprite, also called a water nymph. However, like in The Little Mermaid, Rusalka falls in love with a human Prince. She has a witch turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Rusalka must win and keep the Prince’s love, or else there will be disastrous consequences for them both. Will a jealous Princess ruin Rusalka’s plan? Will Rusalka’s father be able to bail her out if things go awry? Will true love triumph? Rusalka premiered in 1901 and has become one of the most beloved lyric fairy tales of all time. We are proud to be producing Rusalka for the first time in our 82-year history. Music Director Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs. Scenery, properties, projections, and costumes for this production were constructed by Minnesota Opera Shops and are owned by Minnesota Opera and Boston Lyric Opera.

VIDEO EXCERPTS The Wood Sprites tease the Water Gnome ( Hao Jiang Tian) as they frolic in the forest. Rusalka (Sara Gartland, making her Pittsburgh Opera debut) asks the Moon to tell the Prince that she loves him. The Prince (Jonathan Burton) is astonished to see Rusalka (Sara Gartland) in the forest, and isn't sure if she's a woman or a fairy tale. The witch Ježibaba (Marianne Cornetti) shows the Wood Sprites the magic potion she is brewing for Rusalka. Vodník the Water Gnome (Hao Jiang Tian) laments that his daughter Rusalka the Water Sprite (Sara Gartland) has fallen in love with a human. The Foreign Princess (Leah Hawkins) works to ensnare the Prince (Jonathan Burton), much to the dismay of Rusalka (Sara Gartland). View our full collection of video excerpts on our Rusalka YouTube playlist. Videos by RLG Creations. SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS Warning - the following contains spoilers about the plot ACT 1 The water sprite Rusalka has fallen in love with a human—the Prince—when he came to swim in her lake. Now she wants to become human herself and live on land to be with him. Rusalka’s father, Vodník the water goblin, is horrified and tells her that humans are evil and full of sin. When Rusalka insists, claiming they are full of love, he says she will have to get help from the witch Ježibaba. Rusalka calls on the moon to tell the Prince of her love and then implores Ježibaba for help. She agrees to turn Rusalka into a human—but warns her that if she doesn’t find love she will be damned and the man she loves will die. Also, by becoming mortal, Rusalka will lose her power of speech. Convinced that her feelings for the Prince can overcome all spells, Rusalka agrees and Ježibaba gives her a potion to drink. As dawn breaks, the Prince appears with a hunting party and finds Rusalka by the lake. Even though she can't speak to him, he is captivated by her beauty and leads her away to his castle. From the lake, the voices of Vodník and the other water sprites are heard, mourning the loss of Rusalka. ACT 2 The Prince demands to know why Rusalka is so cold towards him, though he remains determined to win her. A Foreign Princess, who has come for the wedding, is intent on winning the Prince for herself. She mocks Rusalka’s silence and reproaches the Prince for ignoring his guests. The Prince demands Rusalka dress for the ball and escorts the Princess into the castle for the beginning of the festivities. Disconsolate, Rusalka falls into a disturbed sleep. Vodník appears and sings of his grief at losing Rusalka. When she begs her father to help, telling him that the Prince no longer loves her, Vodník has little to offer. The Prince enters with the Princess and confesses his love for her. When Rusalka intervenes, rushing into his arms, he rejects Rusalka. Vodník warns the Prince of the fate that awaits him, then disappears into the watery depths with Rusalka. The Prince asks the Princess for help but she ridicules him and tells him to follow his bride into hell. ACT 3 Rusalka waits by the lake once again, lamenting her fate. Ježibaba mocks her, then hands her a knife and explains that there is a way to save herself: she must kill the Prince. Rusalka refuses, throwing the weapon into the water and sinks into the lake in despair. The wood sprites enter, singing and dancing, but when Vodník explains to them what has happened to Rusalka, they fall silent and disappear. The Prince, desperate and half crazy with remorse, emerges from the forest, looking for Rusalka and calling out for her to return to him. She appears from the water, reproaching him for his infidelity, and explains that now a kiss from her would kill him. Accepting his destiny, he asks her to kiss him to give him peace. She does, and he dies in her arms. Rusalka asks for mercy on his soul and disappears into the water.

Disguises. Romantic Compromises. Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro is one of the most popular comic operas of all time. Filled with amusing cases of mistaken identity and romantic subterfuge, plus music by a Mozart at the height of his powers, The Marriage of Figaro has stood the test of time for centuries.The Marriage of Figaro is a sequel to The Barber of Seville. The story opens several years later, in Count Almaviva’s palace near Seville, Spain. Rosina is now the Countess, but her husband has lost much of his interest in her and is a would-be philanderer. Figaro is in love with the Countess’s servant Susanna, who he plans to wed that very day. However, their employer Count Almaviva has his eye on Susanna. In fact, the Count intends to invoke the hated feudal practice of droit de seigneur—the infamous right of the lord to sleep with a commoner’s bride on her wedding night. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess are understandably outraged at this possibility, and are determined not only to prevent it, but to teach the Count a lesson. Music Director Antony Walker conducts. The Marriage of Figaro is sponsored in part by a generous gift from Robert and Christine Pietrandrea.

While preparing for their wedding, Figaro learns from Susanna that their philandering employer, Count Almaviva, has designs on her. At this news, the servant vows to outwit his master. Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur—the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess are amazed to find her there. All seems well until the gardener, Antonio, storms in with crushed geraniums from a flower bed below the window. Figaro, who has run in to announce that the wedding is ready, pretends it was he who jumped from the window, faking a sprained ankle. Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio burst into the room waving a court summons for Figaro, which delights the Count, as this gives him an excuse to delay the wedding. ACT III. In an audience room where the wedding is to take place, Susanna leads the Count on with promises of a rendezvous in the garden. The Count, however, grows doubtful when he spies her conspiring with Figaro; the Count vows revenge. Marcellina is astonished but thrilled to discover that Figaro is in fact her long-lost natural son by Bartolo. Mother and son embrace, provoking Susanna's anger until she too learns the truth. Finding a quiet moment, the Countess recalls her past happiness, then joins Susanna in composing a letter that invites the Count to the garden that night. Later, during the marriage ceremony of Figaro and Susanna, the bride manages to slip the note, sealed with a hatpin, to the Count, who pricks his finger, dropping the pin, which Figaro retrieves. ACT IV. In the moonlit garden, Barbarina, after unsuccessfully trying to find the lost hatpin, tells Figaro and Marcellina about the coming assignation between the Count and Susanna. Basilio counsels that it is wise to play the fool. Figaro inveighs against women and leaves, missing Susanna and the Countess, ready for their masquerade. Alone, Susanna rhapsodizes on her love for Figaro, but he, overhearing, thinks she means the Count. Susanna hides in time to see Cherubino woo the Countess—now disguised in Susanna's dress—until Almaviva chases him away and sends his wife, who he thinks is Susanna, to an arbor, to which he follows. By now Figaro understands the joke and, joining the fun, makes exaggerated love to Susanna in her Countess disguise. The Count returns, seeing, or so he thinks, Figaro with his wife. Outraged, he calls everyone to witness his judgment, but now the real Countess appears and reveals the ruse. Grasping the truth at last, the Count begs her pardon. All are reunited, and so ends this \"mad day\" at the Almaviva court. ~Adapted from Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

These will be its first-ever Pittsburgh performances. Set in Medieval Scotland, Ariodante tells a tale of love, jealousy, deception, and redemption. Princess Ginevra, daughter of the King, loves and is betrothed to Prince Ariodante. Faithful to Ariodante, Ginevra rejects the advances of the vile Polinesso, Duke of Albany, who views Ginevra as a path to the throne. Dalinda, a lady of the court who has feelings for Polinesso, explains to Polinesso that Ginevra is marrying Ariodante. Polinesso cynically tricks Dalinda into making it appear that Ginevra has been unfaithful to Ariodante. Both Ariodante and the King fall for the ruse. Ariodante contemplates suicide, and the King not only condemns his daughter, but disowns her too. His trick proving successful, Polinesso orders his henchmen to kill the only witness to his plot—Dalinda. Ariodante, still grief-stricken at what he believes was Ginevra’s betrayal, runs off the henchmen and saves Dalinda. Dalinda, realizing that her love for Polinesso was a colossal mistake, explains to Ariodante that Ginevra was framed, and that Ginevra has been faithful to Ariodante all along. Dalinda and Ariodante must work together to clear Ginevra’s name, and the King must learn of Polinesso’s treachery, so that Ariodante and Ginevra can live happily ever after. Antony Walker conducts.

SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS Act I The mutual love of the Princess Ginevra and Prince Ariodante has the full approval of her father, the King. As the opera begins, she confides her feelings to Dalinda when Polinesso, a Duke who covets the throne, enters her room. He makes advances towards Ginevra, which she forcefully rejects. Dalinda tells him that Ginevra’s heart is already betrothed, but confides that she herself is not indifferent to him. A plot thereupon forms itself in Polinesso’s mind to make use of Dalinda to be revenged on Ginevra. In the royal gardens, Ariodante and Ginevra, exchanging vows, are given the blessing of the King, who intends to make Ariodante his successor. Polinesso persuades Dalinda to dress up as Ginevra that night: he promises to respect her honour and make her his wife. Dalinda is overjoyed. Ariodante’s brother Lurcanio declares his love for Dalinda, but she rejects him. Lurcanio reflects on his love for Dalinda. The act ends with Ginevra and Ariodante expressing their happiness and calling upon the nymphs to celebrate their joy in dance and song. Act II That night Ariodante, unable to sleep for excitement, walks in the royal gardens when he encounters Polinesso, who feigns surprise at the news of the forthcoming marriage - he claims to be enjoying Ginevra’s favours. When Ariodante becomes furious at these outrageous words, Polinesso promises to substantiate his charge: he tells him to hide and observe with his own eyes. Lurcanio conceals himself to watch the unfolding events. Dalinda, disguised as Ginevra, enters into an apartment with Polinesso. Ariodante is horrified at this apparent betrayal. Polinesso, swearing devotion to Dalinda, gloats over the success of his ruse. The following morning the King learns that Ariodante has thrown himself into the sea and is believed to be drowned. He breaks the news to Ginevra, who collapses in shock. His own grief is heightened when Lurcanio accuses Ginevra of unchaste behaviour that drove Ariodante to his death. He demands justice: he will fight anyone who offers to champion Ginevra's cause. The King disdainfully declares that Ginevra is no longer his daughter. Ginevra is bewildered at the charge and mourns her fate. Act III Ariodante, alive, wanders in a field. Dalinda is amazed to see him alive, and he is equally astonished to learn from her of the trickery of which he was the victim. They set out for the palace. The King refuses to see his daughter until a champion for her can be found. Polinesso, with an eye to succession to the throne, offers himself. Though Ginevra refuses his aid, her father insists on it. Polinesso meets Lurcanio in public combat and is killed by a mighty blow. Lurcanio, still burning to avenge Ariodante's supposed death, challenges any further champions of Ginevra. A knight whose face is hidden by a closed visor appears. Lurcanio tells the stranger to prepare for combat, but the knight raises his visor and, to general astonishment, reveals himself as Ariodante. He offers to explain all if the King will pardon Dalinda for her unwitting part in the deception. The King at once hastens to his daughter with the happy news while Dalinda gladly accepts Lurcanio’s courtship. Ginevra, in the apartment to which she has been confined, is giving way to despair when the King joyfully arrives to tell her she is vindicated. She reunites with Ariodante. The opera concludes with their wedding celebration.

Verdi’s Il Trovatore is an epic tale of love and sacrifice, deception and revenge. Manrico and the Count di Luna, on opposite sides of a civil war in 1400s Spain, don’t know they are actually brothers. Both are in love with Leonora; she loves Manrico and spurns the Count’s advances. Azucena is the tormented woman who raised Manrico. Years ago, the Count’s father killed Azucena’s mother. Azucena swore to avenge her mother’s death, and will do whatever it takes to punish the Count and his family. After the Count captures Azucena, Manrico attempts to rescue her. When Manrico himself is then captured, Leonora tells the Count she will give herself to him in exchange for Manrico’s freedom. But Leonora and Azucena each have deadly tricks up their sleeves, and are determined to have the last laughs. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to present Verdi’s sweeping, majestic opera Il Trovatore for the first time since 1999. Antony Walker conducts; Daniel Rigazzi directs.

SYNOPSIS ACT I Spain, late 15th century, during the War of the Castilian Succession. The commander of the Royalist Aragon troops, Count di Luna, is obsessed with Leonora, a young noblewoman in the queen’s service, who does not return his love. Outside the royal residence, his soldiers keep watch at night. They have heard an unknown troubadour serenading Leonora, and the jealous count is determined to capture and punish him. To keep his troops awake, the captain, Ferrando, recounts the terrible story of a Romani woman who was burned at the stake years ago for bewitching the count’s infant brother. The woman’s daughter then took revenge by kidnapping the boy and throwing him into the flames where her mother had died. The charred skeleton of a baby was discovered there, and di Luna’s father died of grief soon after. The daughter disappeared without a trace, but di Luna has sworn to find her. In the palace gardens, Leonora confides in her companion Ines that she is in love with a mysterious man she met before the outbreak of the war, and that he is the troubadour who serenades her each night. After they have left, Count di Luna appears, looking for Leonora. When she hears the troubadour’s song in the darkness, Leonora rushes out to greet her beloved but mistakenly embraces di Luna. The troubadour reveals his true identity: He is Manrico, leader of the partisan rebel forces. Furious, the count challenges him to fight to the death. ACT II During the duel, Manrico overpowered the count, but some instinct stopped him from killing his rival. The war has raged on, with the Royalist forces victorious in the most recent battle. Manrico was badly wounded, but his mother, the Romani woman Azucena, has nursed him back to health in a camp in the mountains. A band of Romani gathers at their mountain hideout. Azucena is the woman for whom di Luna has been searching. Her life is scarred by the memory of her mother’s death and the terrible revenge she exacted. Manrico, who has never heard the full story, is determined to finally know the truth. Azucena tells him how she stole the older count’s infant son but, in her manic rage, accidentally murdered her own child instead. When Manrico demands to know who he truly is, Azucena is evasive: All that matters is the mother’s love she has shown him all his life and that he does not fail to take revenge on the house of di Luna. A messenger arrives with news that Leonora, believing that Manrico has fallen in battle and hoping to escape di Luna’s grasp, is entering a convent. Azucena pleads with Manrico to stay, but he resolves to go to her immediately. Di Luna arrives at the convent with his troops to take Leonora by force, but his attempt to seize her is foiled when Manrico and his men attack. In the ensuing chaos, the lovers escape. ACT III Di Luna has laid siege to the fortress where Manrico has taken refuge with Leonora. Soon, soldiers bring in Azucena, whom Ferrando and his men have captured wandering nearby. When she hears di Luna’s name, her reaction arouses suspicion, and Ferrando recognizes her as the murderer of the count’s brother. Azucena cries out to Manrico to rescue her, and di Luna realizes that he now has his enemy in his hands. He orders a pyre built for Azucena before the walls of the fortress. Inside the castle, Manrico and Leonora are preparing to be married. She is frightened, but he assures her of his love even in the face of death. When news of Azucena’s capture arrives, Manrico summons his forces and prepares to attack. ACT IV Manrico’s army has been defeated, and he and Azucena are being held captive in di Luna’s castle. Leonora has escaped and now comes to the prison to pray for Manrico’s salvation. When di Luna orders the execution of Manrico and Azucena at sunrise, Leonora offers herself to the count in return for her lover’s life; however, she secretly takes a slow-acting poison, sealing her fate. In their cell, Manrico tries to comfort Azucena, who is terrified of the stake and the fire that await her. Leonora appears to tell Manrico that he is saved and urges him to escape. Understanding that she has promised herself to di Luna, he denounces her and refuses to flee. But the poison is already taking effect, and Leonora dies in his arms, just as di Luna arrives. He sends Manrico to his execution. Azucena cries out that her mother is avenged: di Luna has killed his own brother. -Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review - onStage Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera Brings Verdi’s ‘Il Trovatore’ Back to Life Review - Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Il Trovatore’: A Smashing Success, Let the Anvils Ring Review - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera's latest is a must-see, on par with cult classics Opera Wire - Jonathan Burton Headlines Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Il Trovatore’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh – March Theater Guide Accelerando podcast - Pittsburgh Opera’s Chorus Master Mark Trawka talks about the work the Pittsburgh Opera Chorus is doing in the weeks and months ahead of opening night onStage Pittsburgh - Canonsburg Native Alexandra Loutsion to Sing in ‘Il Trovatore’ NEXTpittsburgh - 16 things to do this week News Pub - Things to do this week onStage Pittsburgh - What’s On Stage Pittsburgh for the week of March 20th, 2023 Observer-Reporter - Chartiers-Houston grad performs in Pittsburgh Opera's 'Il Trovatore' Cranberry Eagle - Butler County native in Pittsburgh Opera role City Paper - A very large guide to spring events in Pittsburgh KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Today Live - Pittsburgh Opera bringing Verdi’s 'Il Trovatore' to the stage Tribune Review - Themes of romance, revenge drive Pittsburgh Opera's 'Il Trovatore' The Incline - Meet the local singing everywhere from PNC Park to Western Psych Owl Scribe Blog - Washington County , Pa.

They live-streamed their last hours onto internet sites, leaving behind a trail of devastating video footage: drinking and smoking, cuddling and crying, and preparing to die. Denis and Katya could have been your children, best friends, or classmates. Two teenagers who lived every moment—including their last—online. What led to their violent deaths? Why did they choose to broadcast their final moments on social media? And what does it say about the voyeuristic society that watched, liked, and objectified them in real-time, transforming two kids into clickbait? This visceral opera uses verbatim text to examine the vast public response to the events surrounding the tragedy of these two Russian runaways, exploring how stories are shaped and shared in our age of trolls, conspiracy theories, fake news, and 24/7 digital connection. The New York Times called Denis & Katya \"an intimate, haunting triumph\", and Musical America called it “ … the most brilliantly original operatic work I’ve seen in a decade.\" Production co-produced by Opera Philadelphia, Music Theatre Wales, and Opéra Orchestre National Montpellier. Denis & Katya is sponsored in part by a gift from an Anonymous Donor.

SYNOPSIS On November 14, 2016, two teenagers in the Russian village of Strugi Krasnye began broadcasting video of themselves through Periscope, a live-streaming website. The pair, named Denis and Katya, explained to their viewers that they had run away, had hidden in a cabin for three days, fought violently with Katya’s relatives when confronted, and were now barricaded in the cabin and under threat by local police and Special Forces. The Periscope audience grew throughout the day as they streamed more videos. Friends, relatives, classmates, and teachers from their hometown of Pskov joined the live-stream and wrote to them, as did strangers who happened upon it. By the next day, the story of Denis and Katya facing off against Special Forces had reached news outlets around the world. Thousands more watched their videos. Conspiracy theories bloomed. Fan sites appeared. Denis and Katya became a brief internet sensation. The opera’s six characters (Journalist, Friend, Teacher, Teenager, Neighbor, Medic) are all played by two singers. They re-tell Denis and Katya’s story from six very different viewpoints.

On the run after a series of tragic incidents, five North Philadelphia teens find refuge in an abandoned, condemned house in West Philadelphia at the exact location that served as headquarters of the MOVE organization, where a 1985 standoff with police infamously ended with a neighborhood destroyed and 11 people dead, including five children. This self-defined family is assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home and begin to see their squatting as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear.

SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS ACT I On the run after a series of tragic incidents, five North Philly teens ( John Henry, John Blue, John Little, John Mack, and Un/Sung) find refuge in an abandoned, condemned house in West Philadelphia. The home sits at the exact location of the headquarters of the MOVE organization before it was infamously burned to the ground in a 1985 police confrontation that left 11 people dead and no government officials indicted or meaningfully reprimanded. The teens are assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home (who we refer to as the OGs), and begin to see their squatting in the home as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear or precarious circumstance. Into this mix enters Glenda, a north Philly native turned West Philly cop who patrols this quiet stretch of Osage Avenue on her regular beat. Glenda observes that the young people have taken over the home and are “hanging out” there when they are supposed to be in school. She moves determinedly to sweep the kids out of the home, threatening them with arrest and ridiculing their intentions. But in a chaotic accident, she moves too far and mistakenly discharges her firearm, injuring one of the teens. In her temporary shock, Glenda is overrun by the other young people, who turn the tables on the situation by pointing Glenda’s own gun at her and subsequently handcuffing her to a chair in the center of the house. ACT II John Henry lays bleeding in a pool of sorrow, confronted at a desperately young age with his own mortality. All parties are now frightened, disoriented, and vulnerable, and the only sense of empowerment in this bleak moment comes from the OGs who infuse the home with a spirituality that is palpably felt by the young people in particular. Glenda challenges the validity of this ‘movement of holy ghosts,’ but cannot deny that whatever the origins, the young people, led by the sole female-identified teen, Un/Sung, are clearly operating from a place of conviction. Still suspicious and driven by her vulnerable position, Glenda probes this conviction, intimating that the teens are not motivated by principle alone. Finally the teens succumb to the reality of the moment: their brother has been wounded and is in need of help, and the most expedient way to help him is to leave the house. They decide to reveal to Glenda the circumstances that drove them to squat in the house on Osage. They think Glenda has something to hide (firing at an unarmed teen) and so do they, and if they come clean with their story, the combination of transparency and quid pro quo may grant them safe, unreported passage out of the house. However, in revealing the origins of their plight, they also realize that a young man who John Blue has killed is Glenda’s own brother, Manny. ACT III The family confers feverishly about the increasingly limited options for their next move, concluding that the best “survival” tactic is to “disappear” Glenda altogether. Un/Sung commits to completing the task, instructing her brothers to leave quickly for a predetermined location to avoid any further witnesses while she does “something awful.” A confrontation between the young girl and Glenda ensues, concluding with silence, complete darkness in the theater, and the assumption of injury. When the lights come all the way up, the family has vanished, and the house on Osage Avenue has burned to the ground. Glenda tells an interviewer the story of her waning moments with the family from a plane above the action, but we watch a different story unfolding at eye level. All the players are setting the house on “fire,” not with kerosene or grand flames, but with small, glass-framed candles. The image is not of arson, but of ritual. The Family is turning the home into an altar, perhaps an instrument of forgiving, of letting go, of release, and of renewal. As the lights come down for the final time, the last remaining image on stage is of the skeleton of a house, lit up like a shrine, while the OGs move around it in holy rites.

Click play below or download these excerpts for an offline treat! Act I Overture - performed by the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra \"The birdcatcher am I\" - sung by Craig Verm as the bird catcher Papageno “This image is enchantingly beautiful\" - sung by Sean Panikkar as Tamino \"Swift steps, ready courage\" - sung by Layla Claire as Pamina and Craig Verm as Papageno \"Long live Sarastro!\" sung by the Pittsburgh Opera Chorus Act II \"All feels the joys of love\"- sung by Daniel Curran as Monostatos “Hell's vengeance boils in my heart\" - sung by Audrey Luna as the Queen of the Night “Ah, I feel it, it is vanished\" - performed by Layla Claire as Pamina \"A girl or a woman\" - sung by Craig Verm as Papageno \"Pa... pa... pa...\" - sung by Craig Verm as Papageno and Meredith Lustig as Papagena Final Chorus - performed by the Pittsburgh Opera Chorus SYNOPSIS The story, in brief The Magic Flute takes place in a mythical land between the sun and the moon. ACT I Three ladies in the service of the Queen of the Night save Prince Tamino from a serpent. When they leave to tell the queen, the birdcatcher Papageno appears. He boasts to Tamino that it was he who killed the creature. The ladies return to give Tamino a portrait of the queen’s daughter, Pamina, who they say has been enslaved by the evil Sarastro. Tamino immediately falls in love with the girl’s picture. The queen, appearing in a burst of thunder, tells Tamino about the loss of her daughter and commands him to rescue her. The ladies give a magic flute to Tamino and silver bells to Papageno to ensure their safety on the journey and appoint three spirits to guide them. Sarastro’s slave Monostatos pursues Pamina but is frightened away by Papageno. The birdcatcher tells Pamina that Tamino loves her and is on his way to save her. Led by the three spirits to the temple of Sarastro, Tamino learns from a high priest that it is the Queen, not Sarastro, who is evil. Hearing that Pamina is safe, Tamino charms the wild animals with his flute, then rushes off to follow the sound of Papageno’s pipes. Monostatos and his men chase Papageno and Pamina but are left helpless when Papageno plays his magic bells. Sarastro enters in great ceremony. He punishes Monostatos and promises Pamina that he will eventually set her free. Pamina catches a glimpse of Tamino, who is led into the temple with Papageno. ACT II Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino will undergo initiation rites. Monostatos tries to kiss the sleeping Pamina but is surprised by the appearance of the Queen of the Night. The Queen gives her daughter a dagger and orders her to murder Sarastro. Sarastro finds the desperate Pamina and consoles her, explaining that he is not interested in vengeance. Tamino and Papageno are told by a priest that they must remain silent and are not allowed to eat, a vow that Papageno immediately breaks when he takes a glass of water from a flirtatious old lady. When he asks her name, the old lady vanishes. The three spirits appear to guide Tamino through the rest of his journey and to tell Papageno to be quiet. Tamino remains silent even when Pamina appears. Misunderstanding his vow for coldness, she is heartbroken. The priests inform Tamino that he has only two more trials to complete his initiation. Papageno, who has given up on entering the brotherhood, longs for a wife instead. He eventually settles for the old lady. When he promises to be faithful, she turns into a beautiful young Papagena, but immediately disappears. Pamina and Tamino are reunited and face the ordeals of water and fire together, protected by the magic flute. Papageno tries to poison himself but is saved by the three spirits, who remind him that if he uses his magic bells he will find true happiness. When he plays the bells, Papagena appears and the two start making family plans.The Queen of the Night, her three ladies, and Monostatos attack the temple but are defeated and banished. Sarastro blesses Pamina and Tamino as all join in hailing the triumph of courage, virtue, and wisdom. - Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Forever changed, the Elf resolves to give closure to the victim’s Beloved. Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, The Rose Elf takes you to a world where a tiny elf lives happily and contently in the protective petals of a beautiful rose. When the flower closes one night before the Elf returns home, the Elf seeks shelter in some nearby honeysuckle. There, the Elf overhears the Girl and her Beloved exchange tender goodbyes, as the Beloved prepares for a lengthy journey. After the Beloved embarks, the Elf watches in horror as the Brother brutally murders the Beloved and buries him beneath a linden tree.The Elf whispers the truth to the Girl while she sleeps, leaving her a leaf from the linden tree to convince her that their message was not a dream. When she awakens, the Girl pursues the terrible truth, even though it could destroy her. Join us for the Pittsburgh premiere of David Hertzberg’s hauntingly beautiful opera The Rose Elf. The New Yorker says its music “blooms with warmth and depth”, and OperaWire praises Hertzberg as “masterful at using a minimal number of instrumentalists to create gargantuan sound.” Developed through Opera Philadelphia’s Double Exposure program in 2016 and 2018, The Rose Elf premiered on June 6, 2018 in the catacombs of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, in a production by R.B. Schlather. These will be its second-ever performances. The Rose Elf is sponsored in part by a gift from an anonymous donor.

A garden in ripest bloom. Midday, the sun is shining.The elf, a strange, sensuous being who dwells within the roses, lies inside a blossom, caressing its petals, breathing its fragrance. They leave to frolic in the garden, tracing the paths in the veins of a linden leaf. When they return to rest at nightfall, the rose has closed in the cold. Seeking shelter, they happen on a bower, wherein two human lovers exchange mournful goodbyes. The girl gives her lover a rose, which opens from the warmth of her kiss, and the elf crawls inside. As the lover treks through the dark forest, he caresses and kisses the gifted rose, scorching and smothering the elf inside, when suddenly, he is murdered in cold blood, with the elf as witness. The elf then visits the girl in sleep and tells her the grisly tale: her brother has killed her lover. The girl wakes and exhumes her lover’s body from the forest. The elf returns to the garden and finds their rose has wilted.II. Winter. The girl’s room. Wan light.The girl has interred her beloved in a pot with jasmine sprigs. The elf watches from a potted rose on her windowsill as she waters the jasmine flowers with her tears. Her brother enters; the elf listens as he mocks her, asks her vainly why she cries over the pot. As the girl withers away, the elf is moved to console her; they crawl into her ear and whispers to her about the garden, the roses, and the elves that dwell within them. The girl passes peacefully, and the elf returns to a new rose in the garden. The brother returns and takes the pot from under her lifeless head, brings it to his room, and as the curtain falls slowly, the silhouettes of the jasmine flowers grow and blossom.

A violent encounter between a man, a woman, and a notorious brigand. Seven testimonies, each proposing a different perspective on the crime. Akutagawa’s classic short story “In a Grove,” which inspired the plot of Kurosawa’s renowned film Rashomon, offers a searing investigation into the impossibility and elusiveness of truth. Epic and intimate, timeless and devastatingly timely, the story’s structure lends itself powerfully to music’s ability to conjure—via repetition and variation—how human perception, memory, and desire are fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Join us for this unique world-premiere experience in a place where the ground shifts beneath your feet—a space of ambiguity and clarity, of beauty and menace, and of fragility and strength.

We, the audience, are the silent, unseen interlocutor, gathering testimony from seven witnesses—potential perpetrators of a crime. A woodcutter states that he found a body in the grove, on the mountain where he goes to cut wood. A priest testifies that he passed a man leading a woman on a horse along the Foundry Post Road. A policeman recounts his arrest of Luther Harlow, a local vigilante, who some say is responsible for the spate of women gone missing from the mountain. A woman describes her daughter, Leona, an aspiring botanist, whose new husband, Ambrose, a schoolteacher, appears to have been murdered. The mother pleads with the interlocutor to find the girl, who is missing. Luther Harlow confesses. Taken by the beauty of a young woman he encountered along the mountain road, he had tried to lure the girl and her husband into a nearby grove, promising treasure. As Luther tells his story, he relives the events: The girl resists Luther’s ruse, but her husband, eager to regale his new bride with pretty trinkets, follows Luther into the grove. Luther quickly disposes of the young man, and when Leona discovers her husband bound and gagged, she pulls a knife on Luther, who wrestles her to the ground, intending to assault the girl. But she slips from his grasp, pelting Luther with a rock, knocking him out just long enough for her to free her husband, arming him with her knife. Ambrose is hesitant at first, but Leona urges him to fight. Although the schoolteacher is no match for the vigilante, he somehow holds his own. Soon enough, however, Ambrose’s strength wanes. Leona intervenes by shooting Ambrose’s rifle into the air, and in the confusion, Luther stabs him, grabs the gun and flees, leaving him for dead. Leona reluctantly delivers her testimony: of having encountered a dubious man on the mountain road; of her husband Ambrose’s misguided desire to follow the stranger into the grove; of being left to wait alone in the gloam, calling on the relics of the ghost forest for protection. When the man returns without Ambrose, she follows, terrified of what has befallen her husband. In the grove, Luther attempts to assault her, but she eludes him, hurling a stone at him, freeing Ambrose so that he can defend them both. Ambrose hesitates, and she lashes out at him. Ambrose has no choice but to fight a losing battle. Leona again steps in, pointing Ambrose’s rifle to the sky and firing. In the tumult, the marauder disappears, and Leona discovers that her husband is bleeding. She gathers medicinal plants to staunch the wound. But as she tends to Ambrose, he jealously rebukes her, accusing her of having consorted with Luther. Thrown by his anger, she balks, and in that moment he expires. Believing she killed him, she tries, over and over again to take her own life, but fails. Leona confesses that she murdered her husband. A medium channels the dead man, who articulates the secret Ambrose was never able to tell his new bride—that his heart has always been weak, ever since suffering from rheumatic fever as a small child. The medium and Ambrose relive the incidents leading up to Ambrose’s death from his perspective, tormented by the fact that in his final moments, he allowed his wife to believe it was she who killed him, rather than his failing heart. CREATORS STATEMENTS IN A GROVE opens with a wash of white noise—a sonic representation of wildfire and smoke. As the opera progresses, rhythms, harmonies, motives, and eventually melodies emerge out of this aural fog, mirroring the way facts emerge, piece by piece, in this musical detective story. As our characters relate their tales, motives and melodies recur, but they also evolve, paralleling each narrator’s shifting perspective. A throwaway melody in Luther’s scene becomes the basis for Leona’s aria in hers; finally, this melody becomes the core of the final confession, a duet between a Medium and Ambrose. Throughout the work, the voices are transformed electronically. I tried to exemplify remembrance’s flawed roughness by distorting the voices using reverb, pitch-shifting, and, granulation—effects that suggest that our characters’ memories are flawed, foggy, or plain wrong. In setting out to compose IN A GROVE, I tried to take something unconventional—a story told over and over again from different perspectives—and marry it to something familiar: music, where themes, repetition, and variation help us navigate and understand this mysterious tale. —Christopher Cerrone What we discovered in the process of making IN A GROVE is that Leona is the heart of the story. And that truth is not just prismatic, elusive, and fallible, it is personal, emotional, razor-edged. The truths and untruths that we perceive, gloss over, embrace, refute or deny drive the trajectories of our lives. The uncanny weave of opacity and transparencies so aptly conjured in Akutagawa’s remarkable tale makes up the fabric of lived experience. The story’s form, that of seven testimonies, asks us to listen differently—to approach narrative, language, image and sound in new ways, and in so doing, perhaps, to see and hear anew. Obfuscation is pervasive, and yet the crystalline architecture of Chris’s music serves as a revelatory container for the ineffable. Mary’s exquisite staging plunges us into an ever-shifting grove sited within a ghost forest in the Pacific Northwest, a setting that mines a series of profoundly American truths. —Stephanie Fleischmann 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

Fiery free-spirit Carmen, who lives her life to the fullest, can have any man she wants. But when she seduces naïve Corporal Don José, she gets more than she bargains for. Carmen works in a cigarette factory. When a knife fight with another employee leads to her arrest, she charms Corporal Don José into letting her escape. Like a moth drawn to a flame, Don José forsakes his military career and the innocent peasant girl Micaëla for a life on the lam with Carmen and a band of smugglers. Never one to settle down, the passionate Carmen gets bored with Don José and becomes involved with the glamourous, testosterone-filled bullfighter Escamillo. Left with nothing, Don José decides that if he can’t have Carmen, no one can. Full of magnetic melodies, colorful costumes, and tragic twists, you’ll fall in love with George Bizet’s one-and-only Carmen. Antony Walker conducts; Garnett Bruce directs.

In Seville by a cigarette factory, soldiers comment on the townspeople. Among them is Micaëla, a peasant girl, who asks for a corporal named Don José. Moralès, another corporal, tells her he will return with the changing of the guard. The relief guard, headed by Lieutenant Zuniga, soon arrives, and José learns from Moralès that Micaëla has been looking for him. When the factory bell rings, the men of Seville gather to watch the female workers— especially their favorite, Carmen. She tells her admirers that love is free and obeys no rules (\"L’amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). Only one man pays no attention to her: Don José. Carmen throws a flower at him, and the girls go back to work. José picks up the flower and hides it when Micaëla returns. She brings a letter from José’s mother, who lives in a village in the countryside (\"Ma mere, je la vois\"). As he begins to read the letter, Micaëla leaves. José is about to throw away the flower when a fight erupts inside the factory between Carmen and another girl. Zuniga sends José to retrieve Carmen. She refuses to answer Zuniga’s questions, and José is ordered to take her to prison. Left alone with him, she entices Jose with suggestions of a rendezvous at Lillas Pastia’s tavern (\"Près des remparts de Séville\"). Mesmerized, he agrees to let her get away. As they leave for prison, Carmen escapes. Don José is arrested. ACT II. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès entertain the guests at the tavern (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\"). Zuniga tells Carmen that José has just been released. The bullfighter Escamillo enters, boasting about the pleasures of his profession (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\"), and flirts with Carmen, who tells him that she is involved with someone else. After the tavern guests have left with Escamillo, the smugglers Dancaïre and Remendado explain their latest scheme to the women (\"Nous avons en tête une affaire\"). Frasquita and Mercédès are willing to help, but Carmen refuses because she is in love. The smugglers withdraw as José approaches. Carmen arouses José's jealousy by telling him how she danced for Zuniga. She dances for him now, but when a bugle call is heard he says he must return to the barracks (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur\"). Carmen mocks him. To prove his love, José shows her the flower she threw at him and confesses how its scent made him not lose hope during the weeks in prison (\"La fleur que tu m’avais jetée\"). She is unimpressed: if he really loved her, he would desert the army and join her in a life of freedom in the mountains. José refuses, and Carmen tells him to leave. Zuniga bursts in, and in a jealous rage José fights him. The smugglers return and disarm Zuniga. José now has no choice but to join them. ACT III. Carmen and José quarrel in the smugglers’ mountain hideaway. She admits that her love is fading and advises him to return to live with his mother. When Frasquita and Mercédès turn the cards to tell their fortunes, they foresee love and riches for themselves, but Carmen’s cards spell death—for her and for José (\"Melons! Coupons!\"). Micaëla appears, frightened by the mountains and afraid to meet the woman who has turned José into a criminal (\"Je dis que rien ne m’épouvante\"). She hides when a shot rings out. José has fired at an intruder, who turns out to be Escamillo. He tells José that he has come to find Carmen, and the two men fight (\"Je suis Escamillo\"). The smugglers separate them, and Escamillo invites everyone, Carmen in particular, to his next bullfight. When he has left, Micaëla emerges and begs José to return home. He agrees when he learns that his mother is dying, but before he leaves he warns Carmen that they will meet again. ACT IV. Back in Seville, the crowd cheers the bullfighters on their way to the arena (\"A deux cuartos\"). Carmen arrives on Escamillo’s arm, and Frasquita and Mercédès warn her that Jose is nearby. Unafraid, she waits outside the entrance as the crowds enter the arena. Jose appears and begs Carmen to forget the past and start a new life with him (\"C’est toi! C’est moi!\"). She calmly tells him that their affair is over: she was born free and free she will die. The crowd is heard cheering Escamillo. José keeps trying to win Carmen back. She takes off his ring and throws it at his feet before heading for the arena. José stabs her to death. - Adapated from Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances! Here are some details and resources to help.

As the boy grows into a young man, he becomes a student artist and activist. His mother worries for his future, while his father tries to prepare him for the harsh realities of 21st-century America. The father also wrestles with his own identity as a police officer, a \"Black man in blue\", and the friction that causes within the family. When their deepest fears come true, the grieving parents must navigate the turbulent waters of loss at the hands of police, while seeking answers and support from their church and community. Tony Award®–winning composer Jeanine Tesori and NAACP Theatre Award–winning librettist Tazewell Thompson’s new opera is inspired by contemporary events and Black literature. Exploring race, violence, and reconciliation, Blue places timely issues at the forefront of modern opera and invites audiences to the emotional epicenter of their impact. Glenn Lewis conducts. Tazewell Thompson directs, with Cindy C. Oxberry as Associate Director. Blue was commissioned by The Glimmerglass Festival and premiered in July, 2019.The scenery and costumes were originally created for a co-production with The Glimmerglass Festival, Washington National Opera, and Lyric Opera of Chicago.

SYNOPSIS (CONTAINS SPOILERS) Synopsis - warning, contains spoilers The Mother calls her Girlfriends together to her apartment in Harlem to tell them she is expecting a child. Their joy turns to concern when she tells them she is carrying a boy; they warn her that her son will not be welcomed in this country. When her hope and love – for the child she carries and for The Father, a policeman – will not be shaken, her Girlfriends relent, blessing her and the child. The Father’s police officer buddies, on the other hand, are immediately joyful – and a bit jealous – when they learn their fellow officer has fathered a son. Sixteen years later, The Son, a student artist and activist, frequently finds himself at odds with the law for his involvement with non-violent political protests. The Father confronts The Son, who pushes back, accusing his police officer Father of upholding an oppressive system. Despite The Son’s bitter words, The Father tells him he will always love him and hold him close. After The Son is shot by a police officer at a protest, the heartbroken Father meets with The Reverend, who attempts to comfort him and encourages him to forgive. The Father, adopting the attitude of The Son, lashes out angrily. As the funeral for The Son approaches, The Girlfriends return to Harlem to support the grief-stricken Mother as she prepares to lay her son to rest. At the funeral, Father and Mother pray with the congregation, asking God to welcome their son to Heaven. The Father briefly becomes lost in a fog of emotion, guilt, regret and memory, then finds his way back to the community gathered around him in church. In an epilogue, we see The Father, The Mother and The Son, together, in a bittersweet moment around a kitchen table, sharing a meal, as The Son reconciles with his father and announces his plans for further artistic studies and one more peaceful protest. - from the Glimmerglass Festival FURTHER READING These materials were compiled by the Glimmerglass Festival Online Resources Campaign Zero advocates for policies – informed by data, research and human rights principles – to change the way police serve communities. Race Forward brings systemic analysis and an innovative approach to complex race issues to help people take effective action toward racial equity. Race Forward offers online resources as well as in-person trainings. The United Nations offers a variety of resources for combatting racism. The Center for Popular Democracy and Policy Link, two nonprofit advocacy organizations, partnered with various protesters and street-level organizers to identify concrete steps toward promoting justice and equity in law enforcement. Highlights from their report were published by mic.com as “15 Things Your City Can Do Right Now to End Police Brutality.” Articles and Essays to Read Online Letter to My Son First published in The Atlantic, this adapted excerpt from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ book Between the World and Me finds him explaining the construction of race and its inseparable ties with the idea of an American national identity. Interweaving history with personal anecdotes, Coates’ moving letter depicts the institutionalized racism that both forms and punishes black bodies, instilling a fear that governs black lives. Letter from a Region in My Mind Writing for The New Yorker in 1962, James Baldwin recounts his life through navigating various faiths; in the process, he elucidates the religious underpinnings behind constructions of race in America and worldwide. The Long History of Black Officers Reforming Policing From Within Part of The Atlantic’s project “The Presence of Justice,” Taylor Hosking’s contribution documents the ongoing project of minimizing racial bias in police operations from the Reconstruction Era to today. As Hosking illustrates, not only are minority civilians consistently targeted and punished to greater extents than their White peers, but black officers continue to face racism both in the field and internally within their departments. Police Officers Tell of Strains Of Living as a “Black in Blue” Lena Williams’ 1988 report for the New York Times profiles black officers who feel a tension between their jobs and their racial identity. These officers express how this tension affects their job performance, their perception of their communities and how white officers perceive them. How to raise a black son in America In his brief TED Talk, poet Clint Smith remembers a night from his boyhood when he played with water guns in an empty parking lot with his white friends. He paints the scene of his father’s furious and fearful response. Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis In 2018, “Black infants in America [were] now more than twice as likely to die as white infants,” and “Black women [were] three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts.” Full of statistics and first-hand accounts, Linda Villarosa’s article for the New York Times claims that systemic racism causes adverse health effects in black women that can jeopardize pregnancy, and that racial bias and inequalities in health care put black mothers and black babies at risk. America’s Unfair Rules of the Road Corinne Ramey at Slate gives detailed accounts of how public transportation in many U.S. cities fails to provide quality access and service to neighborhoods of racial minorities and low income. Not only do recent transportation projects devalue and destroy minority neighborhoods, they also negatively impact the health and wellness of communities of color. Spike Lee on Gentrification When an audience member at the Pratt Institute in New York asks film director Spike Lee to consider the positive impacts of gentrification, Lee fires back with stories from his own lived experience to evidence the real harm faced by displaced black communities in Brooklyn. The Long, Painful History of Police Brutality in the U.S. Digging through the archives of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Katie Nodjimbadem finds that today’s concerns over police brutality date back to decades before the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Policing the Police: A Civil Rights Story Historian Sarah Brady Siff at the online journal Origins details how the problem of “policing the police” stretches back decades and is rooted in the structure of American politics itself. U.S. federalism has created a tension between rights guaranteed by the Constitution and police authority that resides at the state and local levels, and sorting out those tensions remains an unfinished part of the civil rights movement. Books for Further Exploration: Between the World and Me (Ta-Nehisi Coates) pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, offering a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race (edited by Jesmyn Ward) gathers some of today’s most original thinkers and writers in response to James Baldwin’s 1962 classic, The Fire Next Time. The collection is divided into three parts that shine a light on the darkest corners of our history, wrestle with our current predicament, and envision a better future. Savage Inequalities: Children in America’s Schools (Jonathan Kozal) reports on the author’s two-year tour of U.S. public schools, which revealed extreme divide in the quality of resources, facilities and staffing between the country’s richest and poorest schools, challenging the belief that our country provides all children with equal opportunities. White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son (Tim Wise) is personal examination of the way in which racial privilege shapes the daily lives of white Americans in every realm: employment, education, housing, criminal justice, and elsewhere. Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America (Michael Eric Dyson) argues that if we are to make real racial progress we must face difficult truths, including being honest about how black grievance has been ignored, dismissed, or discounted. The New Jim Crow (Michelle Alexander) is an account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status—denied the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights Movement. Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice (Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins and Ann Hazzard) follows two families – one white, one black – as they discuss a police shooting of a black man in their community. The story aims to answer children’s questions about such traumatic events, and to help children identify and counter racial injustice in their own lives. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CREATORS ‘THIS LIBRETTO WAS MY PERSONAL LETTER TO THE WORLD’ A conversation with composer Jeanine Tesori and librettist and director Tazewell Thompson about the opera Blue. Tazewell: “When Jeanine Tesori picked me as the librettist for a project about race in the US, I knew I was going to write a story that centred on the continuous, countless and unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by mostly white police officers. There isn’t a Black man in the US today who hasn’t had some sort of encounter or conflict with a police officer, whether it be minor or traumatic and violent.” Jeanine: “After several conversations with Tazewell, who also drew on his own personal experiences, we decided to create an opera that would tell the story of a Black family living in Harlem. I knew Tazewell’s portrayal would be nuanced, without compromising the complexity of the characters or the story. This is why the father’s character was depicted as a police officer – or in keeping with Tazewell’s clever pun: a ‘Black man in blue’. The father’s identity as a ‘Black man in blue’ is complicated and fraught with tension. He puts his life on the line on a daily basis, but his family – especially his activist son – don’t consider him a hero when he comes home at the end of the day. We felt that was a story worth telling.” Tazewell: \"Blue is an intimate portrayal of a Black family living in Harlem, whose world is ripped apart when they become victims of a gross injustice. The opera exposes the systemic racism that seeps into everyday American life like poison, and reminds audiences that police brutality headlines come with a lot of pain and suffering that doesn’t just end when replaced with the latest breaking news. Blue is a story that needs to be told in the opera world. It is so important for all of us to see operas that don’t necessarily reflect our own personal experiences. In this way, we may surprise ourselves by detecting relatable elements – or if there are none, we can ask ourselves what we have learned from this story.” Jeanine: Our objective is to challenge audience assumptions by going against the grain. For instance, Blue opens with a very pared-down scene, in which an African American man stands in silence before the audience. It is important to me to challenge a viewer’s expectations, but it is equally imperative that I do so in a manner that lets the audience draw their own conclusions, without being told which direction to head in. This is true of music as well: most people observing a large choir of black singers in a church, will expect to hear gospel – but this was not Tazewell's experience. I therefore decided to compose hymn-like chorales and choral music, that generally do not rely on counterpoint, but are more about singing together collectively in harmony. We did not want to depict the church as a brick building, but rather as a warm and loving community that – when united in song – has a similar effect to a hug in that it gets you through hard times.” Tazewell: \"While Blue definitely tackles some heavy and painful subjects, it also offers hope. There are some wonderfully heartening moments in this opera, such as the cheerful scene in which the mother tells her friends she is expecting a baby; or the bar scene in which the novice father shares his good news with his boisterous colleagues and friends; or the clash between the father and his rebellious son, who fight like cat and dog to defend their emotional territory, but then clasp each other in a warm and compassionate embrace; or perhaps most moving of all: the church community and friends who reach out to and support the bereaved parents in their final goodbye to their son. Even though everyone’s hopes for the son’s future have been shattered, they all pray that one day everything will be different.” - Originally published by Dutch National Opera 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

SEEN hails it as “one of the best black-tie galas in town” and by the Tribune-Review as one of Pittsburgh’s top parties of the year. Each year, this event is a critical aspect of Pittsburgh Opera’s fundraising efforts to keep music alive in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. Annually, Maecenas galas celebrate a successful season for Pittsburgh Opera and recognize individuals who have contributed significantly to the performing arts in Pittsburgh or within their respective fields. Each year, a few worthy recipients receive Awards from Pittsburgh Opera.

The Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass costs $20 a month. Subscribers can add an Opus Pass Subscription Add On to their traditional seated subscription package for an extra $5 a month. For more information about the Opus Pass Subscription Add On, please see the 'FAQs - Opus Pass Subscription Add On' section below. How do I buy an Opus Pass? You can buy a Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass by calling 412-281-0912 ext. 3, or you can order online. How long does my Opus Pass last? Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are valid for one year from its date of issue. Your Opus Pass will automatically renew unless you take action to make changes or cancel. When does my Opus Pass 'start'? If you purchase your Opus Pass between June-September 2024, it will activate as of October 1st, in time for the first opera of our 2024-25 season. Your billing cycle will begin in early October. If you purchase your Opus Pass on or after October 1, 2024, it is valid for one year from the date of purchase. What if I buy an Opus Pass after the season is already underway? Since your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes is valid for one year from its date of issue, you will be able to use your Pass for any Pittsburgh Opera performances in the following season that fall within one year of purchase. For example, if you purchase a Pass in December 2024, you will be able to use it for all our remaining 2024-25 Season performances, as well as our October and November 2024 performances, even though they are part of our 2025-26 season. How do you bill me? Your credit card will be charged once each calendar month. Patrons who buy an Opus Pass will be charged monthly from date of purchase. Can I pay for the whole year upfront? Yes. If you choose our one-time payment option, you will save $20, i.e. you will get one month free. My credit card's expiration date is before my Opus Pass expires. What should I do? Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 with your updated credit card information prior to your card expiring. Is it possible to cancel my Opus Pass before it expires? If you need to cancel your Opus Pass before it expires, you can choose to receive a refund for the difference in value between what you've paid so far for your Pass and the normal single ticket face value price of any tickets you redeemed. For example, if you had been a Passholder for six months and paid $120 for your Pass so far, and you'd redeemed your Pass for one ticket which had a regular price of $110, you would be eligible for a $10 refund. If you have redeemed your Pass for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever do that of course! All future ticket reservations will be forfeited upon cancellation of membership. There are no refunds retroactively after your Pass expires. FAQS - TICKET REDEMPTION How do I redeem my Pass for a ticket to a specific performance? Simply email us, fill out your Opus Pass Ticket Redemption Form, or call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 as early as five days or as late as 3 hours prior to the performance. How far in advance can I redeem my Pass for a specific performance? Ticket redemption opens five days before each performance and is available up to three hours before showtime. Where will you seat me? For performances at the Benedum Center and Byham Theater, you will be given the best available seats, excluding Zone A. Specific seat assignments are not guaranteed. Can I request a specific seating location? Yes. You can specify whether you prefer to sit on the Orchestra Level (i.e. the main floor) or the Balcony Level, whether you prefer to be on House Left, House Right, on or close to an aisle vs. in the middle of a row, etc. You can also request to be seated next to other specific Opus Passholders or ticketholders, e.g. 'Please seat me next to my friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'. If you need an accessible seat, e.g. for a wheelchair, please let us know. Pittsburgh Opera will do our best to honor specific seating requests. But please know that specific seat assignments are not guaranteed, and are subject to availability. Where do I pick up my tickets? At Will Call. Please remember to bring photo ID. What if a performance is already sold out? If a performance is already sold out when a Passholder tries to redeem their Pass for a ticket, they will have the option of being placed on the Wait List, and will be eligible to use tickets released by other patrons. What if I end up not being able to attend a performance I redeemed my Pass for? We understand that unexpected circumstances may prevent you from attending a performance which you've redeemed your Pass for. If that happens, please let us know at least one hour prior to the performance so that we can release your ticket. Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera. FAQS - GENERAL QUESTIONS Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it? No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together? It depends. If you and your partner always attend the opera together, i.e. you always buy two seats together, and you plan on attending at least three performances this coming season together, then you should buy two Opus Passes - one for you and one for your partner. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. If your \"+1\" guest changes from show to show - sometimes your significant other comes with you, but other times you bring a neighbor, friend, or work colleague - you should not buy two Opus Passes, because each Pass is issued in a specific person's name. Instead, when you redeem your Pass for a specific performance, mention that you need to add on a second ticket. You can purchase additional tickets at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance? Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together. I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I? Yes! Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you. Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them? No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund. Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events? Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately. FAQS - OPUS PASS SUBSCRIPTION ADD ON I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass? Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. Subscribers who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price. Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription? If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly? Subscribers who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments. Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway? Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost. If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On? If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

You can read their Safety & Security statement, which includes an updated list of prohibited items, and read their Bag Policy, on their website. Beware of Ticket Resellers Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is opera.culturaldistrict.org, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site trustarts.org. If you do not see culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org in the webpage's URL, you are not using our official ticketing website and are likely on a reseller website. The risks of buying from a reseller include: You may pay more than face value. Your tickets may not be real. Your tickets may not be able to be replaced when lost or stolen. Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us. Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information. Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value. Resellers go to great lengths to come up first in Google search results, and often use official-sounding names such as \"Ticket Network\", \"Box Office Ticket Sales\", \"Ticket Smarter\", \"Ticket City\", and so on.

Photo credit: David Bachman Striving for accessibility throughout the organization Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances. Inclusion at Pittsburgh Opera Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company. CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage (unless otherwise noted). These are sometimes referred to as \"OpTrans\". AUDIO COMMENTARY Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory. Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the \"pre-show\". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the \"play-by-play\". Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby. ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid. The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Infrared: Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is audio amplification only. Channel 2 on the Infrared Hearing Devices includes music and Audio Commentary Inductive Loop: If a patron's hearing aid has a Telecoil or Phone Position setting, the hearing aid can be worn and a special headset with an inductive loop system can be used (and worn around the neck). Infrared hearing devices cannot be used in the ears with a hearing aid. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume. SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter. To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600. Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do. Video by Abbie Whitehurst BRAILLE AND LARGE PRINT PROGRAMS Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby. Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list. SENSORY WORKSHOPS Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department.

Photo credit: David Bachman Here are some questions people ask us all the time. Have a question that’s not asked or answered here? Feel free to give us a call at 412-281-0912 during office hours. How much do tickets cost? Click here to explore season ticket options. How long will the opera be? You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" What's a good show for opera newbies this season? Typically first-timers like to start with classics like Madama Butterfly (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love. You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage. Is it OK to bring kids to the opera? Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form. Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative! Is there any special etiquette I should know about? A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too. If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer! Is Pittsburgh Opera still performing at the Benedum Center? Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage. Can I park near the theater? Here's information about parking near each of our performance venues. Parking near the Benedum CenterThe are several parking garages within a few blocks of the Benedum Center. The big blue Theater Square Garage (entrance on 7th St. between Penn Ave and Ft. Duquesne Blvd) - As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are $20, but Pittsburgh Opera subscribers can buy parking vouchers for $15 each. Besides saving money, these come in handy when there’s a lot going on downtown because you're guaranteed a spot. To buy vouchers, call 412-281-0912. The Smithfield & Liberty garage, 629 Smithfield Street. As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are just $6. The 6th & Penn garage on Penn Ave between 6th & 5th, has $15 night/weekend rates as of October 2019. You can get real-time parking availability at ParkPGH. Parking near CAPA TheaterSince the demolition of the old parking garage at 9th and Penn, the closest sizable lots are: Smithfield & Liberty garage, 629 Smithfield Street. As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are just $6. Convention Center garage, 1000 Fort Duquesne Blvd, enter on 10th Street. As of October 2019, their night rate is $5 and \"Event Rate\" $13. Parking near Bitz Opera FactoryStreet parking is generally available on Penn Avenue, and there is a surface lot at 24th and Penn, right beside Harp & Fiddle. What time should I arrive for the show? We typically suggest you arrive 30 - 45 minutes before the start time in order to find parking, find your seat, and settle in. How can I learn more about the productions? We’ve got lots of ways to get you tuned in. Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances. You'll hear the story of the opera, some background about the composer, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories. Meet the Artists is after each Tuesday performance. Enjoy great coversation as the singers, conductor and General Director Christopher Hahn talk about the production and their experiences. You may be surprised to see how funny and down-to-earth these artists really are. Can’t wait until showtime? Then tune in to 89.3 FM or visit the WQED-FM website for WQED’s Pittsburgh Opera Preview Show. Gotta have the information right now? Check out the show page for the opera you’re interested in, and explore! You’ll find the story, music and video, cast biographies, and other features. If that’s still not enough, give us a call during office hours: 412-281-0912, ext. 3. Do you have services for people with visual impairments? Yes! Audio Description is available for people with visual impairments during the second Tuesday performance during the 2020-21 season. Using hearing devices, you can hear the supertitles read along with descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. We also have Braille and large-print program summaries available.

The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers for Armida and/or Madama Butterfly add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. HOW TO ADD A RIDESHARE VOUCHER TO YOUR TICKET PURCHASE: 1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box: (See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:) 2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page: 3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for: 4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu: You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance. You can then check Check Out as usual. HOW DOES IT WORK? Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records. At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this: Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them. Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you. FAQS When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can. Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine. What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages. What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free. Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use. I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage, or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber. Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food. I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases. What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient. I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal? As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. FAQS Where is the childcare provided? The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service. What are the age limits? The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Do I need to buy a ticket for my child who will be using the childcare service? Yes, but it's free. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Please use the process shown in the \"How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase\" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done? Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the \"Liability Waiver\" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. When do I drop off and pick up my child? The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS. After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts? No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance. Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use? Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. Will there be food provided? Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication? No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.

When using the App during a performance: Please silence all phone alerts and ringtones prior to the performance Audio content will only be delivered if you have headphones plugged into your phone or are using a Bluetooth headset Please refrain from using your phone for anything other than the app - no texting, social media, emailing, etc. Please be respectful of other patrons when using the app. Hold your phone in your lap - do not hold it up to eye level where it could distract the people sitting next to or behind you Download from Google PlayDownload in the Apple App Store Funding for the Pittsburgh Opera Mobile App is generously provided by an OPERA America Innovation Grant from the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, and by the Hillman Foundation. APP BACKGROUND Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events. The app is powered by Instant Encore, the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe. In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note®. Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center, LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e.g. text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances. Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel. Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences. Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®. We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined, and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season. Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons. After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users. With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season. We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

MADAMA BUTTERFLY CHILD SUPERNUMERARY Download the full casting call here. Pittsburgh Opera is seeking a child to play the role of “Trouble” in our production of Madama Butterfly, to be performed at the Benedum Center in March 2025. This part is a simple but crucial role in the narrative of this wrenching story. Seeking an Asian, Pacific Islander identifying child, no gender preference (however, please note, they will be costumed as a male/boy-presenting character). Though the story specifies a boy three years old, we expect to cast a child of five (5) or six (6) years, ideally small in stature. We are looking to cast two children. Specific performances TBD, but you must be available for all rehearsals and performances. We may choose one child, with a second one as an alternate in case of illness. If auditioning, you must be available for all scheduled calls (rehearsals and performances). The child appears in the latter half of the opera and is on stage at the very end. As such, some rehearsals and performances will end as late as 11pm. The tentative schedule is subject to change. We will also have additional times needed for costume fittings; typically, one to two sessions lasting 30-60 minutes. Auditions will be held on Wednesday, February 12 starting at 4:00pm and may involve basic theater games, following basic instructions and working with adult actors. There is no singing or speaking requirement. Sign up for an audition here! SUPERNUMERARY OPPORTUNITIES Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Opportunities Have you ever wanted to dance with Carmen, serve at the Café Momus, or simply be onstage at the Benedum Center? Apply to become a supernumerary! What is a Supernumerary? A Supernumerary—or “super”— is a non-singing, non-speaking role, much like an extra in film and television. Supers may perform as townspeople, guards, servants, and much more, providing silent but essential support to Pittsburgh Opera’s productions. Supers will share the stage with internationally renowned artists, work with celebrated directors and conductors, and experience the magic of opera from the Benedum Center stage. Stage experience is helpful but not required, and all super positions are filled on a voluntary basis. Individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities are welcome and encouraged to apply. Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary General Information Our larger productions will be presented at the Benedum Center in Downtown Pittsburgh. Staging rehearsals will take place at Pittsburgh Opera’s Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip District. Pittsburgh Opera’s Supernumeraries are enthusiastic and dependable. Supers are required to attend approximately 10-15 rehearsals, generally nights and weekends, as well as all performances. The occasional daytime rehearsal may be scheduled. Supers are paid a small honorarium of $100 and receive two (2) complimentary tickets, subject to availability. We are not able to offer housing or union credit for these roles.

We look forward to hearing from you! VOICE TEACHER AMBASSADOR Pittsburgh Opera knows that the opera stars we love to see on stage would never be able to share the beauty and thrill of the operatic voice without the teachers that helped them along the way. We want to share our love for all voice teachers out there and connect with those who love opera singers as much as we do. Pittsburgh Opera’s Voice Teacher Ambassador program is a new initiative designed for teachers both locally and beyond to enjoy exclusive benefits, share their perspective, and help continue to spread the operatic joy that Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to bringing to the public. Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of. Whether you are a seasoned professor working in a university or run a dedicated private vocal studio, if you are enthusiastic about developing the voices of the world’s opera divas then we’d love to work with you. Voice Teacher Ambassadors will be asked to share Pittsburgh Opera’s digital season of free operatic performances with their students and, as we return to in-person live theater, encourage their students to visit our stages and experience our productions first hand (special student priced tickets are always available). Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your students. Please contact us via email to discuss. We look forward to hearing from you!

In April 2008, Pittsburgh Opera moved into its new home at 2425 Liberty Avenue in the Strip District. The building not only has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869 – but gives Pittsburgh Opera a bright future. In 2021, in grateful recognition of Francois Bitz's exceptional generosity and long affiliation with the company, Pittsburgh Opera was proud to re-name its headquarters in the Strip District, the Bitz Opera Factory. At 45,000 square feet, the $8 million project features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes.Pittsburgh Opera’s building was designed by IKM. A new wrap-around metal, neon, and LEED sign was designed by Bill Kolano. Contractor is Massaro Corporation. The Bitz Opera Factory is the original home of the George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory. The air brake revolutionized railroad transportation. Guests enter the Bitz Opera Factory through this casual, welcoming lobby. The \"Garage\" Conference room has corrugated siding and a clear glass garage door entry. The George R. White Opera Studio is the home of many of our community events, including Brown Bag concerts. Our Five Founders are honored with a memorial plaque in our most-used public space.

Vendor drop offs are allowed the day prior to your event within the hours of 9:30am-1:30pm. Lessee will be charged an additional hourly fee for a ceremony rehearsal or drop off and set up of personal items, décor, etc. on the day prior to the event.

Rented items may be left and picked up on the next business day between 9:30am-1:30pm, with approval from Pittsburgh Opera. Additional Security The staffing fee for each event covers one (1) security guard, hired by PO, for the duration of your Event Time and one (1) PO staff member. Upper Level of GRW Access Guests may NOT access the upper level of the GRW. We will allow individuals up to the second level to put up and take down decorations. We will also allow photographer or videographer limited access the upper level.

Use of electronic cigarettes is also prohibited. Smoking shall only be permitted at designated areas outside of the garage area as defined by Pittsburgh Opera. In accordance with Pennsylvania State law, Lessee shall not permit the use of any illegal drugs in or about the Premises at any time. Guest Arrival There are two large Pittsburgh Opera signs on Liberty Avenue and two A-frame signs are placed at the entrance and exit of the parking garage. We do recommend that volunteers stand at the entrance and exit to the garage for your guests’ ease of mind. These volunteers can answer questions about parking or the event in general. VENDORS Preferred Vendors Pittsburgh Opera has no requirements about vendors, so you can feel free to use any caterer, DJ, photographer, etc. that best suits your budget and taste. A list of preferred Pittsburgh Opera vendors can be provided upon request. Kitchen Access Pittsburgh Opera has a small kitchen that the caterer may use for prep work. Because of poor ventilation, however, this is a warming kitchen and cannot accommodate cooking. If your menu requires on-site cooking, most caterers will set up a kitchen in the parking garage, where ventilation is not a factor. Alcohol Policy You are responsible for bringing in your own alcohol for the event, if desired. Many caterers will provide alcohol and bartenders for your event, at your request. Our only stipulation with the bar is that, due to PA liquor laws, you cannot sell alcohol on site, so the bar must be an open bar. Announcements & Music Pittsburgh Opera will not provide A/V equipment for your event. If you wish to have music or announcements made, it is recommended to hire a DJ. AMENITIES Ice Machine/Ice Storage Unfortunately, we do not have an ice machine. We do, however, have an ice chest located in the kitchen that can hold approximately 4-5 bags of ice. You will need to provide the ice. If you bring coolers with extra ice, they must be kept in the garage. Guest Parking Events have use of our parking garage on a first-come, first-served basis. While we will strive to ensure that at least some of your guests have use of this convenience, full use of the garage is not guaranteed. If our garage is full, other options include street parking (which is metered below 25th Street), the $10 lot at the corner of Penn Avenue and 24th Street (1 block from the Opera), and the $6 garage at the corner of Smallman Street and 24th Street (2 blocks from the Opera). The lot across from the Opera on Liberty Avenue is a private lot and not available for rental. Many rental groups arrange for a shuttle service for their guests, though this is by no means required. Two of our preferred vendors – D & P Valet and The Hub – can also provide parking services. D & P Valet can be onsite to valet guests’ cars. The Hub will set up an account with the Lessee to allow guest’s parking fees to be billed to the Lessee directly. Pittsburgh Opera Tables and Chairs Providing our equipment isn’t being used for another event in the building, the Opera has the following: 11025651025350 72” round table (seats up to 10 people)60” round tables (seats up to 8 people)30” low round tables (seats up to 4 people)26” high round tables8’ x 24” rectangle tables6’ x 24” rectangular utility tables5’ bar unitsblack leather chairs banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim)banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim) Piano Use Pittsburgh Opera usually keeps a grand piano in each room but they are removed if not being used. If your group is interested in using a piano, a small piano tuning fee will be added to your final invoice. Pittsburgh Opera does NOT supply a pianist, so you will be required to hire one of your own. ADMINISTRATIVE Administrative Fees $150 insurance fee covers general liability for insurance for the space. If you wish to purchase more coverage or are looking for additional, generic event insurance, then you may purchase additional plans. $450 staffing fee covers a Pittsburgh Opera staff member to be on-site for the entirety of your rental from set-up to clean-up and a third-party security guard hired by Pittsburgh Opera.

Mr. Hahn made the announcement during yesterday's Board of Directors meeting. Mr. Hahn has been Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director since 2008, and has served as its Artistic Director since 2000. A native of South Africa, Mr. Hahn began his career in opera in 1983 as Rehearsal Administrator at San Francisco Opera. He then managed the San Francisco Opera Center, including the world-renowned Merola Opera Program. Following his 13-year tenure in San Francisco, he served as Artistic Administrator at Los Angeles Opera. Under his leadership, Pittsburgh Opera has significantly expanded its repertoire, introducing Baroque and contemporary operas. Pittsburgh Opera has produced its first three world premieres (The Summer King – the Josh Gibson Story in 2017; Savage Winter in 2018; In a Grove in 2022), with two more in the queue – Woman With Eyes Closed in April 2025, and Time to Act in February 2026. Mr. Hahn has built Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist training program into one of the nation’s best. The program routinely receives over 800 applications for just a handful of open slots each year. Its alums regularly win prestigious national and international awards, and go on to stellar careers in opera. Some notable artists who came through the program during Mr. Hahn’s tenure include Sean Panikkar, Audrey Luna, Eric Ferring, Alexandra Loutsion, Taylor Raven, Benjamin Taylor, Stephanie Havey, Daniel O’Hearn, and Emily Richter. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Hahn’s steady hand and stout spirit navigated uncharted waters. Pittsburgh Opera was the first opera company, and one of few performing arts organizations in the country, to be able to have live indoor performances for in-person audiences during the height of the pandemic. “No single person is more responsible for Pittsburgh Opera’s many successes these past two and a half decades than Christopher Hahn,” says Pittsburgh Opera Board Chair Michele Fabrizi. “His vision and dedication are truly second to none.” Pittsburgh Opera had retained the services of Margaret Genovese of Genovese Vanderhoof & Associates to conduct a comprehensive search for Mr. Hahn’s replacement. It is anticipated that his successor will be identified and announced in early 2026. Fittingly, the final opera Pittsburgh Opera will produce during Mr. Hahn’s tenure will be Falstaff, which famously was composer Giuseppe Verdi’s final opera. Pittsburgh Opera’s season-ending Maecenas Gala, May 16, 2026 at the Carnegie Music Hall, will feature special tributes to Mr. Hahn and the impact he’s had on opera both in Pittsburgh and worldwide. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

Overview: All’s fair in love and war To prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, The Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both? Containing some of Haydn’s most inspired music, not only is Armida Haydn’s most highly regarded opera, but the composer himself referred to it as his best work. Performance Schedule: Saturday, Jan. 25, 2025 * 8:00 PM Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025 * 7:00 PM Friday, Jan. 31, 2025 * 7:30 PM Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025 * 2:00 PM Fun Facts: Multiple composers and librettists have created Armidas over the centuries. All tell variations of Torquato Tasso's poem Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered). Joseph Haydn’s Armida premiered in 1784. Its libretto was taken from Antonio Tozzi's 1775 opera Rinaldo, as amended by Nunziato Porta. A version with music by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini premiered in 1817. Yet another version, composed by Antonín Dvořák, premiered in 1904. Pittsburgh Opera is mounting a new production of Armida. Armida is sung in Italian, with English supertitles projected above the stage.

Pittsburgh Opera is offering free childcare to children ages 2-12 at the Sunday March 24th matinee performance of La Traviata, at 2:00PM at the Benedum Center. The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, the parent/guardian will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when they buy their own ticket to the opera. Their order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes the parent/guardian’s seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. Full details are available at pittsburghopera.org/childcare. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. “For families with young children, finding and paying for a reliable babysitter can be a real barrier to attending arts and entertainment events,” says Pittsburgh Opera’s Director of Marketing & Communications Chris Cox. “This new program allows parents to enjoy the performance with peace of mind knowing that their young kids are being cared for right down the hall by trained, certified professionals. We hope to offer this again at future performances later this year, and that our childcare program inspires copy-cat offerings from other arts organizations once they see how successful it can be.” Like Pittsburgh Opera’s Rideshare program launched earlier this month, this program is generously funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

The program is generously funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation. The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. All performances of Pittsburgh Opera’s remaining four 2024 operas in downtown Pittsburgh are eligible: La Traviata – March 16-24, Benedum Center The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson – April 27 – May 5, Byham Theater Pittsburgh Opera’s two fall 2024 operas at the Benedum Center – operas/dates to be announced soon A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. “Going to the opera is a fun experience that includes more than just seeing the performance. We want patrons to be able to go out to dinner before the show, or grab a drink afterwards, and still be able to use their rideshare voucher,” says Pittsburgh Opera’s Director of Marketing & Communications Chris Cox. “So we’ve built in a time cushion on either end of the performance, as well as the flexibility to be dropped off or picked up at restaurants or other locations near the theater.” Full details are available at pittsburghopera.org/uber. “We believe this is the first program of its kind, both within in the region and within the wider opera world,” says Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn. “We could not afford to do this without the Richard King Mellon Foundation’s generosity, and we are profoundly grateful to them.” “Short term, giving people free rides is great. Longer term, we believe this program will demonstrate to potential ticket buyers that ridesharing is a simple way to get to and from the theater”, Cox explains. “If you don’t want to have to drive yourself, or find parking, or if you don’t live near convenient public transportation or close enough to walk, this is a viable alternative so that you can still enjoy attending our performances.” 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

The finals were Sunday, March 17th in Manhattan. Ms. Richter, a second year Resident Artist, received The Birgit Nilsson Award. The Award carries a $20,000 cash prize in addition to several career-based opportunities and exposure. The competition, per the Metropolitan Opera, is “designed to discover promising young opera singers and assist in the development of their careers. Some of today’s greatest singers got their start in the auditions, including Renée Fleming, Susan Graham, Stephanie Blythe, Eric Owens, Lawrence Brownlee, Lisette Oropesa, Jamie Barton, Michael Fabiano, Anthony Roth Costanzo, Ryan Speedo Green, and Nadine Sierra.” Ms. Richter advanced from the Pittsburgh District competition, to the Great Lakes Regionals, and to the national semi-finals before reaching the finals. Ms. Richter becomes the fourth recent Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist to advance to at least the semi-finals. She joins Brian Vu (a Grand Finalist in 2016), Angel Romero (a Semi-Finalist in 2021), and Daniel O’Hearn (a Grand Finalist in 2022). Ms. Richter is the first to be named a National Grand Finals Winner. Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist program is one of the country's leading training programs for young singers. Every year, exceptional singers from around the world are selected by audition from more than 500 applicants. After completing advanced education, Resident Artists advance their careers under the guidance of the opera world's leaders and innovators. While developing their vocal skills and expanding their repertoire, they study languages, diction, movement, and acting. In addition to performing principal roles in two fully-staged productions, Resident Artists cover principal roles and perform comprimario roles in Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage productions each season. Ms. Richter has shone in key on-stage roles such as the title role in Iphigénie en Tauride, Ma Zegner in Proving Up, and Ginevra in Ariodante. Ms. Richter’s Residency is generously sponsored by John and Virginia DiPucci and Alice Victoria Gelormino. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

While it has many similarities to both the familiar Disney® movie and the Hans Christian Andersen story, they are not exactly the same. First of all, her name is Rusalka, not Ariel. Secondly, Rusalka is not a mermaid per se, but a water sprite, also called a water nymph. However, like in The Little Mermaid, Rusalka falls in love with a human Prince. She has a witch turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Rusalka must win and keep the Prince’s love, or else there will be disastrous consequences for them both. Will a jealous Princess ruin Rusalka’s plan? Will Rusalka’s father be able to bail her out if things go awry? Will true love triumph? Rusalka premiered in 1901 and has become one of the most beloved lyric fairy tales of all time. We are proud to be producing Rusalka for the first time in our 82-year history. Music Director Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs. Scenery, properties, projections, and costumes for this production were constructed by Minnesota Opera Shops and are owned by Minnesota Opera and Boston Lyric Opera.

VIDEO EXCERPTS The Wood Sprites tease the Water Gnome ( Hao Jiang Tian) as they frolic in the forest. Rusalka (Sara Gartland, making her Pittsburgh Opera debut) asks the Moon to tell the Prince that she loves him. The Prince (Jonathan Burton) is astonished to see Rusalka (Sara Gartland) in the forest, and isn't sure if she's a woman or a fairy tale. The witch Ježibaba (Marianne Cornetti) shows the Wood Sprites the magic potion she is brewing for Rusalka. Vodník the Water Gnome (Hao Jiang Tian) laments that his daughter Rusalka the Water Sprite (Sara Gartland) has fallen in love with a human. The Foreign Princess (Leah Hawkins) works to ensnare the Prince (Jonathan Burton), much to the dismay of Rusalka (Sara Gartland). View our full collection of video excerpts on our Rusalka YouTube playlist. Videos by RLG Creations. SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS Warning - the following contains spoilers about the plot ACT 1 The water sprite Rusalka has fallen in love with a human—the Prince—when he came to swim in her lake. Now she wants to become human herself and live on land to be with him. Rusalka’s father, Vodník the water goblin, is horrified and tells her that humans are evil and full of sin. When Rusalka insists, claiming they are full of love, he says she will have to get help from the witch Ježibaba. Rusalka calls on the moon to tell the Prince of her love and then implores Ježibaba for help. She agrees to turn Rusalka into a human—but warns her that if she doesn’t find love she will be damned and the man she loves will die. Also, by becoming mortal, Rusalka will lose her power of speech. Convinced that her feelings for the Prince can overcome all spells, Rusalka agrees and Ježibaba gives her a potion to drink. As dawn breaks, the Prince appears with a hunting party and finds Rusalka by the lake. Even though she can't speak to him, he is captivated by her beauty and leads her away to his castle. From the lake, the voices of Vodník and the other water sprites are heard, mourning the loss of Rusalka. ACT 2 The Prince demands to know why Rusalka is so cold towards him, though he remains determined to win her. A Foreign Princess, who has come for the wedding, is intent on winning the Prince for herself. She mocks Rusalka’s silence and reproaches the Prince for ignoring his guests. The Prince demands Rusalka dress for the ball and escorts the Princess into the castle for the beginning of the festivities. Disconsolate, Rusalka falls into a disturbed sleep. Vodník appears and sings of his grief at losing Rusalka. When she begs her father to help, telling him that the Prince no longer loves her, Vodník has little to offer. The Prince enters with the Princess and confesses his love for her. When Rusalka intervenes, rushing into his arms, he rejects Rusalka. Vodník warns the Prince of the fate that awaits him, then disappears into the watery depths with Rusalka. The Prince asks the Princess for help but she ridicules him and tells him to follow his bride into hell. ACT 3 Rusalka waits by the lake once again, lamenting her fate. Ježibaba mocks her, then hands her a knife and explains that there is a way to save herself: she must kill the Prince. Rusalka refuses, throwing the weapon into the water and sinks into the lake in despair. The wood sprites enter, singing and dancing, but when Vodník explains to them what has happened to Rusalka, they fall silent and disappear. The Prince, desperate and half crazy with remorse, emerges from the forest, looking for Rusalka and calling out for her to return to him. She appears from the water, reproaching him for his infidelity, and explains that now a kiss from her would kill him. Accepting his destiny, he asks her to kiss him to give him peace. She does, and he dies in her arms. Rusalka asks for mercy on his soul and disappears into the water.

The story opens several years later, in Count Almaviva’s palace near Seville, Spain. Rosina is now the Countess, but her husband has lost much of his interest in her and is a would-be philanderer. Figaro is in love with the Countess’s servant Susanna, who he plans to wed that very day. However, their employer Count Almaviva has his eye on Susanna. In fact, the Count intends to invoke the hated feudal practice of droit de seigneur—the infamous right of the lord to sleep with a commoner’s bride on her wedding night. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess are understandably outraged at this possibility, and are determined not only to prevent it, but to teach the Count a lesson. Music Director Antony Walker conducts. The Marriage of Figaro is sponsored in part by a generous gift from Robert and Christine Pietrandrea.

While preparing for their wedding, Figaro learns from Susanna that their philandering employer, Count Almaviva, has designs on her. At this news, the servant vows to outwit his master. Before long the scheming Bartolo enters the servants' quarters with his housekeeper, Marcellina, who wants Figaro to marry her to cancel a debt he cannot pay. After Marcellina and Susanna trade insults, the amorous page Cherubino arrives, reveling in his infatuation with all women. He hides when the Count shows up, furious because he caught Cherubino flirting with Barbarina, the gardener's daughter. The Count pursues Susanna but conceals himself when the gossiping music master Don Basilio approaches. The Count steps forward, however, when Basilio suggests that Cherubino has a crush on the Countess. Almaviva is enraged further when he discovers Cherubino in the room. Figaro returns with fellow servants, who praise the Count's progressive reform in abolishing the droit de seigneur—the right of a noble to take a manservant's place on his wedding night. Almaviva assigns Cherubino to his regiment in Seville and leaves Figaro to cheer up the unhappy adolescent. ACT II. In her boudoir, the Countess laments her husband's waning love but plots to chasten him, encouraged by Figaro and Susanna. They will send Cherubino, disguised as Susanna, to a romantic assignation with the Count. Cherubino, smitten with the Countess, appears, and the two women begin to dress the page for his farcical rendezvous. While Susanna goes out to find a ribbon, the Count knocks at the door, furious to find it locked. Cherubino quickly hides in a closet, and the Countess admits her husband, who, when he hears a noise, is skeptical of her story that Susanna is inside the wardrobe. He takes his wife to fetch some tools with which to force the closet door. Meanwhile, Susanna, having observed everything from behind a screen, helps Cherubino out a window, then takes his place in the closet. Both Count and Countess are amazed to find her there. All seems well until the gardener, Antonio, storms in with crushed geraniums from a flower bed below the window. Figaro, who has run in to announce that the wedding is ready, pretends it was he who jumped from the window, faking a sprained ankle. Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio burst into the room waving a court summons for Figaro, which delights the Count, as this gives him an excuse to delay the wedding. ACT III. In an audience room where the wedding is to take place, Susanna leads the Count on with promises of a rendezvous in the garden. The Count, however, grows doubtful when he spies her conspiring with Figaro; the Count vows revenge. Marcellina is astonished but thrilled to discover that Figaro is in fact her long-lost natural son by Bartolo. Mother and son embrace, provoking Susanna's anger until she too learns the truth. Finding a quiet moment, the Countess recalls her past happiness, then joins Susanna in composing a letter that invites the Count to the garden that night. Later, during the marriage ceremony of Figaro and Susanna, the bride manages to slip the note, sealed with a hatpin, to the Count, who pricks his finger, dropping the pin, which Figaro retrieves. ACT IV. In the moonlit garden, Barbarina, after unsuccessfully trying to find the lost hatpin, tells Figaro and Marcellina about the coming assignation between the Count and Susanna. Basilio counsels that it is wise to play the fool. Figaro inveighs against women and leaves, missing Susanna and the Countess, ready for their masquerade. Alone, Susanna rhapsodizes on her love for Figaro, but he, overhearing, thinks she means the Count. Susanna hides in time to see Cherubino woo the Countess—now disguised in Susanna's dress—until Almaviva chases him away and sends his wife, who he thinks is Susanna, to an arbor, to which he follows. By now Figaro understands the joke and, joining the fun, makes exaggerated love to Susanna in her Countess disguise. The Count returns, seeing, or so he thinks, Figaro with his wife. Outraged, he calls everyone to witness his judgment, but now the real Countess appears and reveals the ruse. Grasping the truth at last, the Count begs her pardon. All are reunited, and so ends this \"mad day\" at the Almaviva court. ~Adapted from Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

These will be its first-ever Pittsburgh performances. Set in Medieval Scotland, Ariodante tells a tale of love, jealousy, deception, and redemption. Princess Ginevra, daughter of the King, loves and is betrothed to Prince Ariodante. Faithful to Ariodante, Ginevra rejects the advances of the vile Polinesso, Duke of Albany, who views Ginevra as a path to the throne. Dalinda, a lady of the court who has feelings for Polinesso, explains to Polinesso that Ginevra is marrying Ariodante. Polinesso cynically tricks Dalinda into making it appear that Ginevra has been unfaithful to Ariodante. Both Ariodante and the King fall for the ruse. Ariodante contemplates suicide, and the King not only condemns his daughter, but disowns her too. His trick proving successful, Polinesso orders his henchmen to kill the only witness to his plot—Dalinda. Ariodante, still grief-stricken at what he believes was Ginevra’s betrayal, runs off the henchmen and saves Dalinda. Dalinda, realizing that her love for Polinesso was a colossal mistake, explains to Ariodante that Ginevra was framed, and that Ginevra has been faithful to Ariodante all along. Dalinda and Ariodante must work together to clear Ginevra’s name, and the King must learn of Polinesso’s treachery, so that Ariodante and Ginevra can live happily ever after. Antony Walker conducts.

SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS Act I The mutual love of the Princess Ginevra and Prince Ariodante has the full approval of her father, the King. As the opera begins, she confides her feelings to Dalinda when Polinesso, a Duke who covets the throne, enters her room. He makes advances towards Ginevra, which she forcefully rejects. Dalinda tells him that Ginevra’s heart is already betrothed, but confides that she herself is not indifferent to him. A plot thereupon forms itself in Polinesso’s mind to make use of Dalinda to be revenged on Ginevra. In the royal gardens, Ariodante and Ginevra, exchanging vows, are given the blessing of the King, who intends to make Ariodante his successor. Polinesso persuades Dalinda to dress up as Ginevra that night: he promises to respect her honour and make her his wife. Dalinda is overjoyed. Ariodante’s brother Lurcanio declares his love for Dalinda, but she rejects him. Lurcanio reflects on his love for Dalinda. The act ends with Ginevra and Ariodante expressing their happiness and calling upon the nymphs to celebrate their joy in dance and song. Act II That night Ariodante, unable to sleep for excitement, walks in the royal gardens when he encounters Polinesso, who feigns surprise at the news of the forthcoming marriage - he claims to be enjoying Ginevra’s favours. When Ariodante becomes furious at these outrageous words, Polinesso promises to substantiate his charge: he tells him to hide and observe with his own eyes. Lurcanio conceals himself to watch the unfolding events. Dalinda, disguised as Ginevra, enters into an apartment with Polinesso. Ariodante is horrified at this apparent betrayal. Polinesso, swearing devotion to Dalinda, gloats over the success of his ruse. The following morning the King learns that Ariodante has thrown himself into the sea and is believed to be drowned. He breaks the news to Ginevra, who collapses in shock. His own grief is heightened when Lurcanio accuses Ginevra of unchaste behaviour that drove Ariodante to his death. He demands justice: he will fight anyone who offers to champion Ginevra's cause. The King disdainfully declares that Ginevra is no longer his daughter. Ginevra is bewildered at the charge and mourns her fate. Act III Ariodante, alive, wanders in a field. Dalinda is amazed to see him alive, and he is equally astonished to learn from her of the trickery of which he was the victim. They set out for the palace. The King refuses to see his daughter until a champion for her can be found. Polinesso, with an eye to succession to the throne, offers himself. Though Ginevra refuses his aid, her father insists on it. Polinesso meets Lurcanio in public combat and is killed by a mighty blow. Lurcanio, still burning to avenge Ariodante's supposed death, challenges any further champions of Ginevra. A knight whose face is hidden by a closed visor appears. Lurcanio tells the stranger to prepare for combat, but the knight raises his visor and, to general astonishment, reveals himself as Ariodante. He offers to explain all if the King will pardon Dalinda for her unwitting part in the deception. The King at once hastens to his daughter with the happy news while Dalinda gladly accepts Lurcanio’s courtship. Ginevra, in the apartment to which she has been confined, is giving way to despair when the King joyfully arrives to tell her she is vindicated. She reunites with Ariodante. The opera concludes with their wedding celebration.

Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all.Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”). ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death. -Adapted from Opera News DETAILS AND RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

This season, his roles include Cesare Angelotti in Tosca, and Ubaldo in Armida. Hailed for his “indelible” and “fine-honed baritone” (The Business Journals), Erik Nordstrom is emerging as an exciting and versatile singing actor to watch. In the 2023/24 season, he made his house debut with Kentucky Opera as Samuel in Pirates of Penzance, and performed Tarquinius in The Rape of Lucretia, and Forester in The Cunning Little Vixen at the University of Cincinnati’s College Conservatory of Music (CCM). This summer, Erik debuts with Wolf Trap Opera covering Guglielmo in Così fan tutte. Erik will join Pittsburgh Opera as a Resident Artist for the 24/25 season and will make his mainstage debut as Angelotti in Tosca. During the 2022/23 season, Nordstrom performed the roles of Marquis de la Force in Dialogues des Carmélites and Hawkins Fuller in Fellow Travelers at CCM. In the summer of 2023, he debuted at Des Moines Metro Opera where he covered Pantalon in Prokofiev’s Love for Three Oranges, and El Dancaïro in Carmen. Additionally, Nordstrom returned to Cincinnati Opera where he workshopped the role of Deacon 1 in Gregory Spears’ The Righteous, which will premiere at Santa Fe Opera in summer 2024. Erik made his professional debut in 2019 as a Studio Artist with Central City Opera (CCO) covering Second Mate in their production of Billy Budd. He then returned to CCO in 2021 to perform Marullo in Rigoletto. He debuted at Cincinnati Opera in 2022 where he workshopped the roles of Interrogator/Customs Officer in Scott Davenport Richards’ Robeson in Moscow, as well as appearing in the ensemble for their summer season. Possessing a rare sensitivity to style and poetry, Erik is regularly engaged by the Cincinnati Song Initiative, a rapidly growing art song organization led by CEO Samuel Martin. In 2019 he teamed with visual artist Jean Balestri and pianist Andrew Crooks to create a through-performed recital that incorporated Appalachian folk tunes, Mahler lieder, Ravel mélodie, and English art song. The performance, titled Me and My Shadow, included projections by Balestri which interacted with the piano, vocal line, and texts of each of the pieces to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Erik received a 2019 Encouragement Award and was named a 2023 District Winner in the Metropolitan Opera Eric and Dominique Laffont Competition, as well as receiving the Ralph Corbett Award in the CCM 2022 Corbett Competition. Nordstrom earned his Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance at Lawrence University where he studied with Steven Spears, and his Master of Music in Opera Performance from CCM where he studied with renowned voice teachers Bill McGraw, and Tom Baresel. He also recently received his Artist Diploma from CCM, under the tutelage of Quinn Ankrum. Mr. Nordstrom's residency is generously sponsored by Hilda Fu, and Mike and Kumiko Lancet.

Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death. -Adapted from Opera News DETAILS AND RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

SYNOPSIS ACT I Seville. Count Almaviva comes in disguise to the house of Doctor Bartolo and serenades Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps confined to the house. Figaro the barber, who knows all the town’s secrets and scandals, explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo’s ward, not his daughter, and that the doctor intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be quartered at Bartolo’s house so that he may gain access to Rosina. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash pay-off. Rosina reflects on the voice that has enchanted her and resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet the man it belongs to—as Almaviva has led her to believe, a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina’s music master, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen in Seville. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Basilio suggests slander as the most effective means of getting rid of Almaviva. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger’s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from billeting soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered in the street, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the house. The civil guard bursts in to arrest Almaviva, but when he secretly reveals his true identity to the captain he is instantly released. Everyone except Figaro is amazed by this turn of events. ACT II Bartolo suspects that the “soldier” was a spy planted by Almaviva. The count returns, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a music teacher and student of Don Basilio, to give Rosina her singing lesson in place of Basilio, who, he says, is ill at home. “Don Alonso” then tells Bartolo that when visiting Almaviva at his inn, he found a letter from Rosina. He offers to tell her that it was given to him by another woman, seemingly to prove that Lindoro is toying with Rosina on Almaviva’s behalf. This convinces Bartolo that “Don Alonso” is indeed a student of the scheming Basilio, and he allows him to give Rosina her lesson. With Bartolo dozing off, Almaviva and Rosina declare their love. Figaro arrives to give Bartolo his shave and manages to snatch the key that opens the doors to Rosina’s balcony. Suddenly Basilio shows up looking perfectly healthy. Almaviva, Rosina, and Figaro convince him with a quick bribe that he is in fact ill and must go home at once. While Bartolo gets his shave, Almaviva plots with Rosina to meet at her balcony that night so that they can elope. But the doctor overhears them and realizing he has been tricked again, flies into a rage. Everyone disperses. The maid Berta comments on the crazy household. Bartolo summons Basilio, telling him to bring a notary so Bartolo can marry Rosina that very night. Bartolo then shows Rosina her letter to Lindoro, as proof that he is in league with Almaviva. Heartbroken and convinced that she has been deceived, Rosina agrees to marry Bartolo. A thunderstorm passes. Figaro and the count climb a ladder to Rosina’s balcony and let themselves in with the key. Rosina appears and confronts Lindoro, who finally reveals his true identity as Almaviva. Basilio shows up with the notary. Bribed and threatened, he agrees to be a witness to the marriage of Rosina and Almaviva. Bartolo arrives with soldiers, but it is too late. He accepts that he has been beaten, and Figaro, Rosina, and the count celebrate their good fortune.

They live-streamed their last hours onto internet sites, leaving behind a trail of devastating video footage: drinking and smoking, cuddling and crying, and preparing to die. Denis and Katya could have been your children, best friends, or classmates. Two teenagers who lived every moment—including their last—online. What led to their violent deaths? Why did they choose to broadcast their final moments on social media? And what does it say about the voyeuristic society that watched, liked, and objectified them in real-time, transforming two kids into clickbait? This visceral opera uses verbatim text to examine the vast public response to the events surrounding the tragedy of these two Russian runaways, exploring how stories are shaped and shared in our age of trolls, conspiracy theories, fake news, and 24/7 digital connection. The New York Times called Denis & Katya \"an intimate, haunting triumph\", and Musical America called it “ … the most brilliantly original operatic work I’ve seen in a decade.\" Production co-produced by Opera Philadelphia, Music Theatre Wales, and Opéra Orchestre National Montpellier. Denis & Katya is sponsored in part by a gift from an Anonymous Donor.

SYNOPSIS On November 14, 2016, two teenagers in the Russian village of Strugi Krasnye began broadcasting video of themselves through Periscope, a live-streaming website. The pair, named Denis and Katya, explained to their viewers that they had run away, had hidden in a cabin for three days, fought violently with Katya’s relatives when confronted, and were now barricaded in the cabin and under threat by local police and Special Forces. The Periscope audience grew throughout the day as they streamed more videos. Friends, relatives, classmates, and teachers from their hometown of Pskov joined the live-stream and wrote to them, as did strangers who happened upon it. By the next day, the story of Denis and Katya facing off against Special Forces had reached news outlets around the world. Thousands more watched their videos. Conspiracy theories bloomed. Fan sites appeared. Denis and Katya became a brief internet sensation. The opera’s six characters (Journalist, Friend, Teacher, Teenager, Neighbor, Medic) are all played by two singers. They re-tell Denis and Katya’s story from six very different viewpoints.

Photo credit: David Bachman Striving for accessibility throughout the organization Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances. Inclusion at Pittsburgh Opera Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company. CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage (unless otherwise noted). These are sometimes referred to as \"OpTrans\". AUDIO COMMENTARY Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory. Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the \"pre-show\". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the \"play-by-play\". Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby. ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid. The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Infrared: Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is audio amplification only. Channel 2 on the Infrared Hearing Devices includes music and Audio Commentary Inductive Loop: If a patron's hearing aid has a Telecoil or Phone Position setting, the hearing aid can be worn and a special headset with an inductive loop system can be used (and worn around the neck). Infrared hearing devices cannot be used in the ears with a hearing aid. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume. SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter. To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600. Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do. Video by Abbie Whitehurst BRAILLE AND LARGE PRINT PROGRAMS Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby. Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list. SENSORY WORKSHOPS Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera.

Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia.

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

At dawn on Easter Sunday, Turiddu sings in the distance of his love for Lola, wife of the carter Alfio. She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza. Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed. PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people. ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking. ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers for Armida and/or Madama Butterfly add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. HOW TO ADD A RIDESHARE VOUCHER TO YOUR TICKET PURCHASE: 1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box: (See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:) 2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page: 3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for: 4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu: You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance. You can then check Check Out as usual. HOW DOES IT WORK? Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records. At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this: Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them. Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you. FAQS When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can. Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine. What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages. What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free. Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use. I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage, or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber. Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food. I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases. What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient. I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal? As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. FAQS Where is the childcare provided? The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service. What are the age limits? The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Do I need to buy a ticket for my child who will be using the childcare service? Yes, but it's free. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Please use the process shown in the \"How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase\" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done? Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the \"Liability Waiver\" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. When do I drop off and pick up my child? The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS. After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts? No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance. Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use? Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. Will there be food provided? Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication? No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.

Photo credit: David Bachman Here are some questions people ask us all the time. Have a question that’s not asked or answered here? Feel free to give us a call at 412-281-0912 during office hours. How much do tickets cost? Click here to explore season ticket options. How long will the opera be? You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" What's a good show for opera newbies this season? Typically first-timers like to start with classics like Madama Butterfly (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love. You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage. Is it OK to bring kids to the opera? Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form. Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative! Is there any special etiquette I should know about? A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too. If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer! Is Pittsburgh Opera still performing at the Benedum Center? Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage. Can I park near the theater? Here's information about parking near each of our performance venues. Parking near the Benedum CenterThe are several parking garages within a few blocks of the Benedum Center.

We typically suggest you arrive 30 - 45 minutes before the start time in order to find parking, find your seat, and settle in. How can I learn more about the productions? We’ve got lots of ways to get you tuned in. Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances. You'll hear the story of the opera, some background about the composer, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories. Meet the Artists is after each Tuesday performance. Enjoy great coversation as the singers, conductor and General Director Christopher Hahn talk about the production and their experiences. You may be surprised to see how funny and down-to-earth these artists really are. Can’t wait until showtime? Then tune in to 89.3 FM or visit the WQED-FM website for WQED’s Pittsburgh Opera Preview Show. Gotta have the information right now?

Only the love of the doting Alfredo can sweep her away from these sensual delights. But while she is a trophy to be won amongst the balls and frivolities of Paris, she is nothing but a scandalous “fallen woman” to genteel society. Violetta and Alfredo’s love threatens to bring shame to his family and ruin his sister's marriage prospects. In secret, Alfredo’s father presses Violetta to shun Alfredo and save the family’s reputation. Heartbroken and health failing, Violetta retreats to her old life of empty pleasures. As her illness worsens, will love slip away as well? Verdi’s exquisite tragedy juxtaposes rousing numbers like the joyous Brindisi with heart-wrenching arias to create a shattering emotional portrait like no other. These performances are sponsored in part by a generous gift from Robert and Christine Pietrandrea, and by The Gailliot Fund.

Made available courtesy of Utah Symphony | Utah Opera SYNOPSIS Violetta Valéry is hosting a lively party at her beautiful Paris apartment. Flora arrives late with a small group and everyone sits for dinner. Gastone introduces Violetta to Alfredo Germont, an admirer who has long adored her from afar. Alfredo flirts with her in a rousing drinking song, the famous Brindisi “Libiamo ne’lieti calici”. Alfredo confesses to Violetta that he has loved her for more than a year. Moved, Violetta attempts to warn him, saying that she “doesn’t know how to love” but he is undeterred. Later, Violetta seriously considers his proposal but then vows that she wants to remain \"sempre libera\" - always free. Alfredo eventually wins Violetta over, and they move to a house in the country. Alfredo sings about how happy he has been ever since Violetta told him “I want to live, faithful to you alone.” However, Alfredo’s father Giorgio Germont disapproves of Violetta’s relationship with Alfredo, which threatens his family’s reputation and his daughter’s engagement. He coerces Violetta into breaking up with Alfredo, then returns to console his son. But Alfredo discovers that Violetta has gone to Flora's masquerade and he returns to Paris to confront her there. At the party, Violetta soon appears on the arm of the Baron, to whom she has returned in an effort to break permanently with Alfredo. After winning a great deal of money, Alfredo confronts Violetta. She lies and says that she no longer loves him, but loves the Baron instead. Enraged, Alfredo calls everyone to witness as he throws the money at Violetta. Germont chastises his son and the Baron challenges Alfredo to a duel. Several months later, Violetta, now destitute and abandoned, is dying of tuberculosis. In a letter she learns that Germont has finally confessed his plot to Alfredo, who is returning to reconcile with her. Their joyful reunion is soon overshadowed by her illness. Violetta bids farewell “to happy dreams of by-gone days.” Alfredo's father also returns with the Doctor, but it is too late.

But as Fate would have it, her brother Oreste is the first to be shipwrecked on the peninsula and brought to the sacrificial altar. The priestess believes her brother to be dead and responsible for the death of their mother. Oreste in turn believes that Iphigénie had been sacrificed to the goddess Diana by their father Agamemnon in return for favorable winds. The siblings fail to recognize each other yet Iphigénie feels a strange kinship with the ill-fated stranger. She wishes to spare him, but Oreste—driven mad by grief and guilt over his family’s compounding tragedy—welcomes death. Will they discover the truth before it is too late? Showcasing the transition from baroque to classical opera, Christoph Gluck reimagines Euripides’ great Greek drama and reignites it in true operatic form.

SYNOPSIS ACT I A storm batters Diane’s temple at Tauride. Iphigénie and the other priestesses—all of them captives from Greece—ask the gods for safety and peace from the storms raging both outside and within their hearts. Iphigénie relates a dream: her home was destroyed; her father was killed by her mother, Clytemnestre, who gave her a dagger; her brother Oreste cried out to her for help, but she was forced to kill him. The priestesses grieve with Iphigénie and urge her not to lose hope that she will see Oreste again, but she prays to Diane to end her life (“Ô toi qui prolongeas mes jours”). The Scythian king, Thoas, comes to Iphigénie in despair, followed everywhere by omens and voices calling for his downfall. Oracles have ordered him to sacrifice every stranger to the country to end his torment. His soldiers come with news of new captives—two Greek men—and Thoas orders Iphigénie to kill them on the altar. The Greeks are brought in: one is half-mad, haunted by past crimes, the other defies Thoas. They are imprisoned as the Scythians call for blood. ACT II The strangers are Oreste and his lifelong friend Pylade. Oreste, who has killed his mother and is being pursued by the Furies, lives on the edge of madness; now he feels responsible for Pylade’s imminent death (“Dieux qui me poursuivez”). Pylade calms Oreste with the pledge that they will die together (“Unis dès la plus tendre enfance”). Pylade is taken away, and Oreste sinks gradually into sleep (“La calme rentre dans mon cœur”). But the Furies stalk him even in his dreams. He awakens from a nightmare to find Iphigénie standing before him. Without revealing her identity she questions him about the royal family in Mycène, and he tells her all: Clytemnestre murdered Agamemnon to avenge the death of Iphigénie, Oreste struck down Clytemnestre to avenge his father and then, he adds, Oreste killed himself. Iphigénie sends the stranger to be shackled to the altar, and—now without country, kindred or hope—mourns the loss of her family (“Ô malheureuse Iphigénie”). Intermission ACT III Iphigénie feels a strong kinship for the prisoner (“D’une image, hélas!”). She resolves to save at least one of the captives and to send the survivor to Mycène with a letter for her sister, Electre. Pylade, who has been tortured, is reunited with Oreste, and Iphigénie tells them Oreste must live and carry the sealed letter (Trio: “Je pourrais du tyran”). Pylade is happy to die for his friend’s life (“Ah! mon ami”). Oreste, determined that he himself should die, seizes the sacrificial knife and threatens to take his own life if Iphigénie will not spare Pylade. Iphigénie gives Pylade the letter and helps him escape. ACT IV Iphigénie tries repeatedly to perform the sacrifice, but she cannot bring herself to harm the stranger and cries out angrily against Diane (“Je t’implore et je tremble”). Oreste is brought in (“Que ces regrets touchant”). Touched by Iphigénie’s sadness and her concern for him, he tries to encourage her to do her duty, calling out in the final moment, “Iphigénie, beloved sister, thus also did you perish at Aulide.” Sister and brother realize the truth. Thoas bursts in: Iphigénie’s plot has been discovered. He orders the Greek killed immediately and is about to sacrifice Oreste himself when Pylade returns with Greek soldiers to save his friend. Thoas is killed in the fray, which is halted when Diane herself appears to pardon Oreste, set the Greek women free, and send prince and princess home to Mycène—and the first happiness they have known since before the Greeks set sail for Troy.

A family of Nebraskan homesteaders in the 1870s dreams of \"proving up.\" They endeavor to obtain the deed to the land they've settled by fulfilling the requirements of the Homestead Act: five years of harvest, a sod house dwelling, and perhaps the most elusive element—a glass window. With their eldest son incapacitated, Ma and Pa send their youngest living child Miles on a mission to share the valuable commodity with their distant neighbors who are expecting a visit from a government inspector. Miles’ journey brings him face to face with the remnants of a shattered past—the ghost of a neighboring farmer driven mad by the requirements of \"proving up.\" The willowy figure knows all too well the cost of the American Dream, and the coveted window soon becomes a broken mirror reflecting great tragedy. “A tense and creepy journey into the heart of Manifest Destiny's darkness” – The New York Times \"Harrowing...powerful... a true opera of our time\" - The Washington Post (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) (Photo credit: David Bachman) PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: The Bitz Opera Factory (Pittsburgh Opera's headquarters), 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh's Strip District When: Saturday, February 17, 2024 * 8:00 PM Tuesday, February 20, 2024 * 7:00 PM Friday, February 23, 2024 * 7:30 PM Sunday, February 25, 2024 * 2:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM Miles Zegner: Fran Daniel Laucerica* Mrs. Johannes “Ma” Zegner: Emily Richter* Mr. Johannes “Pa” Zegner: Brandon Bell* Taller Zegner Sister: Julia Swan Laird* Littler Zegner Sister: Jazmine Olwalia* The Sodbuster: Evan Lazdowski* Peter Zegner: Mason Dowd+ Conductor: James LesniakStage Director: Haley Stamats* Set Designer: Brett RochfordCostume Designer: Nancy JulianLighting Designer: Todd NonnStage Manager: Claire YoungAssistant Conductor: Glenn LewisDirector of Musical Studies: Mark Trawka + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist alumni DETAILS & RESOURCES Four performances at the Bitz Opera Factory, 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

In April 2008, Pittsburgh Opera moved into its new home at 2425 Liberty Avenue in the Strip District. The building not only has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869 – but gives Pittsburgh Opera a bright future. In 2021, in grateful recognition of Francois Bitz's exceptional generosity and long affiliation with the company, Pittsburgh Opera was proud to re-name its headquarters in the Strip District, the Bitz Opera Factory. At 45,000 square feet, the $8 million project features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes.Pittsburgh Opera’s building was designed by IKM. A new wrap-around metal, neon, and LEED sign was designed by Bill Kolano. Contractor is Massaro Corporation. The Bitz Opera Factory is the original home of the George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory. The air brake revolutionized railroad transportation. Guests enter the Bitz Opera Factory through this casual, welcoming lobby. The \"Garage\" Conference room has corrugated siding and a clear glass garage door entry. The George R. White Opera Studio is the home of many of our community events, including Brown Bag concerts. Our Five Founders are honored with a memorial plaque in our most-used public space. Our Wardrobe department stores everything from shoes to corsets to scarves to jewelry, and manufactures costumes when needed. The wig and makeup area, located within the Wardrobe department. The Library holds a treasure trove of books, scores, libretti, recordings, industry magazines, and more. Detail from the top of George Westinghouse's metal safe.

Guest Arrival There are two large Pittsburgh Opera signs on Liberty Avenue and two A-frame signs are placed at the entrance and exit of the parking garage. We do recommend that volunteers stand at the entrance and exit to the garage for your guests’ ease of mind. These volunteers can answer questions about parking or the event in general. VENDORS Preferred Vendors Pittsburgh Opera has no requirements about vendors, so you can feel free to use any caterer, DJ, photographer, etc. that best suits your budget and taste. A list of preferred Pittsburgh Opera vendors can be provided upon request. Kitchen Access Pittsburgh Opera has a small kitchen that the caterer may use for prep work. Because of poor ventilation, however, this is a warming kitchen and cannot accommodate cooking. If your menu requires on-site cooking, most caterers will set up a kitchen in the parking garage, where ventilation is not a factor. Alcohol Policy You are responsible for bringing in your own alcohol for the event, if desired. Many caterers will provide alcohol and bartenders for your event, at your request. Our only stipulation with the bar is that, due to PA liquor laws, you cannot sell alcohol on site, so the bar must be an open bar. Announcements & Music Pittsburgh Opera will not provide A/V equipment for your event. If you wish to have music or announcements made, it is recommended to hire a DJ. AMENITIES Ice Machine/Ice Storage Unfortunately, we do not have an ice machine. We do, however, have an ice chest located in the kitchen that can hold approximately 4-5 bags of ice. You will need to provide the ice. If you bring coolers with extra ice, they must be kept in the garage. Guest Parking Events have use of our parking garage on a first-come, first-served basis. While we will strive to ensure that at least some of your guests have use of this convenience, full use of the garage is not guaranteed. If our garage is full, other options include street parking (which is metered below 25th Street), the $10 lot at the corner of Penn Avenue and 24th Street (1 block from the Opera), and the $6 garage at the corner of Smallman Street and 24th Street (2 blocks from the Opera). The lot across from the Opera on Liberty Avenue is a private lot and not available for rental. Many rental groups arrange for a shuttle service for their guests, though this is by no means required. Two of our preferred vendors – D & P Valet and The Hub – can also provide parking services. D & P Valet can be onsite to valet guests’ cars. The Hub will set up an account with the Lessee to allow guest’s parking fees to be billed to the Lessee directly.

Verdi’s Il Trovatore is an epic tale of love and sacrifice, deception and revenge. Manrico and the Count di Luna, on opposite sides of a civil war in 1400s Spain, don’t know they are actually brothers. Both are in love with Leonora; she loves Manrico and spurns the Count’s advances. Azucena is the tormented woman who raised Manrico. Years ago, the Count’s father killed Azucena’s mother. Azucena swore to avenge her mother’s death, and will do whatever it takes to punish the Count and his family. After the Count captures Azucena, Manrico attempts to rescue her. When Manrico himself is then captured, Leonora tells the Count she will give herself to him in exchange for Manrico’s freedom.

SYNOPSIS ACT I Spain, late 15th century, during the War of the Castilian Succession. The commander of the Royalist Aragon troops, Count di Luna, is obsessed with Leonora, a young noblewoman in the queen’s service, who does not return his love. Outside the royal residence, his soldiers keep watch at night. They have heard an unknown troubadour serenading Leonora, and the jealous count is determined to capture and punish him. To keep his troops awake, the captain, Ferrando, recounts the terrible story of a Romani woman who was burned at the stake years ago for bewitching the count’s infant brother. The woman’s daughter then took revenge by kidnapping the boy and throwing him into the flames where her mother had died. The charred skeleton of a baby was discovered there, and di Luna’s father died of grief soon after. The daughter disappeared without a trace, but di Luna has sworn to find her. In the palace gardens, Leonora confides in her companion Ines that she is in love with a mysterious man she met before the outbreak of the war, and that he is the troubadour who serenades her each night. After they have left, Count di Luna appears, looking for Leonora. When she hears the troubadour’s song in the darkness, Leonora rushes out to greet her beloved but mistakenly embraces di Luna. The troubadour reveals his true identity: He is Manrico, leader of the partisan rebel forces. Furious, the count challenges him to fight to the death. ACT II During the duel, Manrico overpowered the count, but some instinct stopped him from killing his rival. The war has raged on, with the Royalist forces victorious in the most recent battle. Manrico was badly wounded, but his mother, the Romani woman Azucena, has nursed him back to health in a camp in the mountains. A band of Romani gathers at their mountain hideout. Azucena is the woman for whom di Luna has been searching. Her life is scarred by the memory of her mother’s death and the terrible revenge she exacted. Manrico, who has never heard the full story, is determined to finally know the truth. Azucena tells him how she stole the older count’s infant son but, in her manic rage, accidentally murdered her own child instead. When Manrico demands to know who he truly is, Azucena is evasive: All that matters is the mother’s love she has shown him all his life and that he does not fail to take revenge on the house of di Luna. A messenger arrives with news that Leonora, believing that Manrico has fallen in battle and hoping to escape di Luna’s grasp, is entering a convent. Azucena pleads with Manrico to stay, but he resolves to go to her immediately. Di Luna arrives at the convent with his troops to take Leonora by force, but his attempt to seize her is foiled when Manrico and his men attack. In the ensuing chaos, the lovers escape. ACT III Di Luna has laid siege to the fortress where Manrico has taken refuge with Leonora. Soon, soldiers bring in Azucena, whom Ferrando and his men have captured wandering nearby. When she hears di Luna’s name, her reaction arouses suspicion, and Ferrando recognizes her as the murderer of the count’s brother. Azucena cries out to Manrico to rescue her, and di Luna realizes that he now has his enemy in his hands. He orders a pyre built for Azucena before the walls of the fortress. Inside the castle, Manrico and Leonora are preparing to be married. She is frightened, but he assures her of his love even in the face of death. When news of Azucena’s capture arrives, Manrico summons his forces and prepares to attack. ACT IV Manrico’s army has been defeated, and he and Azucena are being held captive in di Luna’s castle. Leonora has escaped and now comes to the prison to pray for Manrico’s salvation. When di Luna orders the execution of Manrico and Azucena at sunrise, Leonora offers herself to the count in return for her lover’s life; however, she secretly takes a slow-acting poison, sealing her fate. In their cell, Manrico tries to comfort Azucena, who is terrified of the stake and the fire that await her. Leonora appears to tell Manrico that he is saved and urges him to escape. Understanding that she has promised herself to di Luna, he denounces her and refuses to flee. But the poison is already taking effect, and Leonora dies in his arms, just as di Luna arrives. He sends Manrico to his execution. Azucena cries out that her mother is avenged: di Luna has killed his own brother. -Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review - onStage Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera Brings Verdi’s ‘Il Trovatore’ Back to Life Review - Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Il Trovatore’: A Smashing Success, Let the Anvils Ring Review - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera's latest is a must-see, on par with cult classics Opera Wire - Jonathan Burton Headlines Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Il Trovatore’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh – March Theater Guide Accelerando podcast - Pittsburgh Opera’s Chorus Master Mark Trawka talks about the work the Pittsburgh Opera Chorus is doing in the weeks and months ahead of opening night onStage Pittsburgh - Canonsburg Native Alexandra Loutsion to Sing in ‘Il Trovatore’ NEXTpittsburgh - 16 things to do this week News Pub - Things to do this week onStage Pittsburgh - What’s On Stage Pittsburgh for the week of March 20th, 2023 Observer-Reporter - Chartiers-Houston grad performs in Pittsburgh Opera's 'Il Trovatore' Cranberry Eagle - Butler County native in Pittsburgh Opera role City Paper - A very large guide to spring events in Pittsburgh KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Today Live - Pittsburgh Opera bringing Verdi’s 'Il Trovatore' to the stage Tribune Review - Themes of romance, revenge drive Pittsburgh Opera's 'Il Trovatore' The Incline - Meet the local singing everywhere from PNC Park to Western Psych Owl Scribe Blog - Washington County , Pa.

SYNOPSIS ACT I Seville. Count Almaviva comes in disguise to the house of Doctor Bartolo and serenades Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps confined to the house. Figaro the barber, who knows all the town’s secrets and scandals, explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo’s ward, not his daughter, and that the doctor intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be quartered at Bartolo’s house so that he may gain access to Rosina. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash pay-off. Rosina reflects on the voice that has enchanted her and resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet the man it belongs to—as Almaviva has led her to believe, a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina’s music master, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen in Seville. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Basilio suggests slander as the most effective means of getting rid of Almaviva. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger’s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from billeting soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered in the street, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the house. The civil guard bursts in to arrest Almaviva, but when he secretly reveals his true identity to the captain he is instantly released. Everyone except Figaro is amazed by this turn of events. ACT II Bartolo suspects that the “soldier” was a spy planted by Almaviva. The count returns, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a music teacher and student of Don Basilio, to give Rosina her singing lesson in place of Basilio, who, he says, is ill at home. “Don Alonso” then tells Bartolo that when visiting Almaviva at his inn, he found a letter from Rosina. He offers to tell her that it was given to him by another woman, seemingly to prove that Lindoro is toying with Rosina on Almaviva’s behalf. This convinces Bartolo that “Don Alonso” is indeed a student of the scheming Basilio, and he allows him to give Rosina her lesson. With Bartolo dozing off, Almaviva and Rosina declare their love. Figaro arrives to give Bartolo his shave and manages to snatch the key that opens the doors to Rosina’s balcony. Suddenly Basilio shows up looking perfectly healthy. Almaviva, Rosina, and Figaro convince him with a quick bribe that he is in fact ill and must go home at once. While Bartolo gets his shave, Almaviva plots with Rosina to meet at her balcony that night so that they can elope. But the doctor overhears them and realizing he has been tricked again, flies into a rage. Everyone disperses. The maid Berta comments on the crazy household. Bartolo summons Basilio, telling him to bring a notary so Bartolo can marry Rosina that very night. Bartolo then shows Rosina her letter to Lindoro, as proof that he is in league with Almaviva. Heartbroken and convinced that she has been deceived, Rosina agrees to marry Bartolo. A thunderstorm passes. Figaro and the count climb a ladder to Rosina’s balcony and let themselves in with the key. Rosina appears and confronts Lindoro, who finally reveals his true identity as Almaviva. Basilio shows up with the notary. Bribed and threatened, he agrees to be a witness to the marriage of Rosina and Almaviva. Bartolo arrives with soldiers, but it is too late. He accepts that he has been beaten, and Figaro, Rosina, and the count celebrate their good fortune.

SYNOPSIS ACT I The Norwegian coast, 19th century. A storm has driven Daland’s ship several miles from his home. Sending his crew off to rest, he leaves the watch in charge of a young steersman, who falls asleep as he sings about his girl. A ghostly schooner drops anchor next to Daland’s ship. Its captain steps ashore and, with increasing despair, reflects on his fate: once every seven years he may leave his ship to find a wife. If she is faithful, she will redeem him from his deathless wandering. If not, he is condemned to sail the ocean until Judgment Day. Daland discovers the phantom ship, and the stranger, who introduces himself as “a Dutchman,” tells him of his plight. The Dutchman offers gold and jewels for a night’s lodging, and when he learns that Daland has a daughter, asks for her hand in marriage. Happy to have found a rich son-in-law, Daland agrees and sets sail for home. ACT II Daland’s daughter, Senta, is captivated by the portrait of a pale man in black—the Flying Dutchman. Her friends, working under the watchful eye of Mary, Senta’s nurse, tease Senta about her suitor, Erik, who is a hunter, not a sailor. When the superstitious Mary refuses to sing a ballad about the Dutchman, Senta sings it herself. The song reveals that the Dutchman’s curse was put on him for a blasphemous oath. To everyone’s horror, Senta suddenly declares that she will be the woman to save him. Erik enters with news of the sailors’ return. Alone with Senta, he reminds her of her father’s wish to find her a husband and asks her to plead his cause, but she remains distant. Realizing how much the Dutchman’s picture means to her, he tells her of a frightening dream in which he saw her embrace the Dutchman and sail away on his ship. Senta declares that this is what she must do, and Erik rushes off in despair. A moment later, the Dutchman enters. Senta stands transfixed. Daland follows and asks his daughter to welcome the stranger, whom he has brought to be her husband. Daland leaves, and the Dutchman, who is equally moved by the meeting, asks Senta if she will accept him. Unaware that she realizes who he is, he warns her of making a rash decision, but she vows to be faithful to him unto death. Daland is overjoyed to learn that his daughter has accepted the suitor. ACT III At the harbor, the villagers celebrate the sailors’ return. Baffled by the strange silence aboard the Dutchman’s ship, they call out to the crew, inviting them to join the festivities. Suddenly the ghostly sailors appear, mocking their captain’s quest in hollow chanting. The villagers flee in terror. Quiet returns and Senta appears, followed by the distressed Erik. He pleads with her not to marry the Dutchman since she has already pledged her love to him. The Dutchman, who has overheard them, lets go of all hope and boards his ship. When Senta tries to stop him, he explains she will escape damnation—the fate of those who betray him—only because she has not yet proclaimed her vows before God. He reveals his identity and Senta ecstatically replies that she knows who he is. As his ship pulls away, she throws herself into the sea, faithful unto death. - Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review: onStage Pittsburgh: Rare Taste of Wagner’s Early Success Staged by Pittsburgh Opera in Brilliant Performance Review: Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Soars with Great Talent Broadway World: Photos: Get a First Look at Pittsburgh Opera THE FLYING DUTCHMAN Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review onStage Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Beloved Favorites, Rare Gems, and Free Concerts this Fall Opera Wire: Kyle Albertson Leads Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: November 2023 Theater Guide onStage Pittsburgh: What’s On Stage Pittsburgh for the week of October 30th, 2023 to the end of December Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Pittsburgh Opera's ghostly 'Flying Dutchman' sails into the Benedum Saturday NEXTpittsburgh: 10 things to do this weekend Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Fun things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend onStage Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera Offers Exclusive Interview with Bryan Register 90.5 WESA: WESA Arts newsletter, Nov. 8 WQED-FM 'Voice of the Arts Podcast' interviews: Maestro Antony Walker Stage Director Sam Helfrich Kyle Albertson (The Dutchman) Marjorie Owens (Senta) Bryan Register (Erik) David Bennett (Supernumerary) WESA.fm: What to do in Pittsburgh this weekend: Nov. 10-12 On State News - Penn State's Student Blog: What To Do In Pittsburgh Over Thanksgiving Break KDKA-TV: Pittsburgh Today Live - Weekend Guide: November 16, 2023 Tribune Review: 5 things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend - Nov. 17-19 VIDEO EXCERPTS Enjoy these video excerpts of our production of The Flying Dutchman.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. Act 1Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed by news that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. He offers his kingdom and Armida’s hand in marriage to the Christian knight Rinaldo if he agrees to fight against his fellow Christians. Enchanted and obsessed with Armida, Rinaldo vows to betray his men and his faith. Meanwhile, Armida, tormented by her passionate love for Rinaldo, pleads with the gods for his safety. Scene 2: A mountainside. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarca plan to rescue Rinaldo from Armida’s enchantment. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians. However, upon encountering Clotarca, Zelmira falls in love with her, despite her better judgment, and offers to lead her to safety. Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of Idreno’s approaching forces. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo about Armida’s charms and chastises him for abandoning his Christian duty. Though remorseful, Rinaldo remains unable to break free from Armida’s enchantment. Act 2Scene 1: Back in the council chamber. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarca's demand that the Christian knight enchanted by Armida be freed. Though the spell is broken, Rinaldo reluctantly leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury. Scene 2: Back at the mountainside. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo back as he prepares to rejoin the crusaders in battle. Armida arrives, pleading for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo, torn but resolute, departs for battle with Ubaldo, leaving Armida betrayed and alone. Act 3 Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, aware that the myrtle tree holds the secret to Armida’s powers, enters the grove to destroy it. Zelmira and a group of nymphs appear, attempting to persuade him to return to Armida. As Rinaldo raises his weapon to strike the myrtle, a disheveled Armida emerges from the tree and confronts him. Unable to kill Rinaldo despite her fury, she watches as he strikes the tree, causing the magic wood to fall lifeless. As Rinaldo tries to escape, he declares to still love her. Armida, consumed by fury, turns into a monster of rage, destroying all in her path.

Based on a true story. • April 27, 30 & May 3,5, 2024Byham Theater Pittsburgh’s unsung heroine who taught America to sing In 1943, the National Negro Opera Company is set to perform on a floating barge to evade racially-segregated venues. But when bad weather threatens—pushing the performance to a segregated performance hall—visionary impressaria Mary Cardwell Dawson must find a way forward. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s dream to provide access for African Americans to perform on stages for all audiences changed the future of opera. Having founded the longest-running, all-Black opera company here in Pittsburgh and organizing opera guilds in the country’s biggest cities, Mary Cardwell Dawson would go on to train hundreds of African American youth to sing. Written by Mark Twain Award-winning playwright and librettist Sandra Seaton, The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson celebrates the remarkable founder of Pittsburgh’s historic and groundbreaking National Negro Opera Company. This play with music includes selections from Carmen as well as original music by award-winning Kennedy Center Composer-in-Residence Carlos Simon.Commissioned by The Glimmerglass Festival (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) (photo credit: David Bachman) PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: Byham Theater, 101 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 When: Saturday, April 27, 2024 * 8:00 PM Tuesday, April 30, 2024 * 7:00 PM Friday, May 3, 2024 * 7:30 PM Sunday, May 5, 2024 * 3:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM Mary Cardwell Dawson: Alyson Cambridge+ Frank: Christian Mark Gibbs+ Phoebe: Jazmine Olwalia* Isabelle: Meroë Khalia Adeeb+ Music Director / Pianist: Marvin Mills+Stage Director: Kimille Howard+Set Designer: James F.

SYNOPSIS: CONTAINS SPOILERS Synopsis - contains spoilers! Summer 1943. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s rehearsal studio. The National Negro Opera Company is preparing to present two operas at the outdoor Watergate Concert Barge in Washington, D.C. For the company’s ambitious schedule, La traviata was performed on the first night with the great soprano Madame Lillian Evanti. However, the damp weather was unsuitable, and the attendance was disappointing. Madame Mary Cardwell Dawson meets with the singers who will perform the leads in a planned performance of Carmen: Frank (Don José), Isabelle (Micaëla), and Phoebe (Carmen). Fearing the rain will again keep the audience away, Madame Dawson inquires about renting a concert hall. While the hall manager agrees to rent to the NNOC, he informs Madame Dawson that the venue has a policy of segregated seating. The future of the company hangs in the balance: according to the Union agreement, the artists and other personnel must be paid, whether the concert takes place or not. An outdoor performance in the rain is sure to be a disappointment, but an indoor performance with segregated seating is unacceptable. The young singers, eager to make their mark, urge Madame Dawson to consider the hall. She initially will not hear it, but as rehearsals continue and the weather worsens, she has moments of doubt. The Union board, expecting a breach of contract, demands she leave rehearsal for an emergency meeting. When they insult her, she fights back and is taken to jail. After Madame Dawson is bailed out, Madame Dawson returns to rehearsal, bruised but undaunted. The young singers realize that Madame Dawson’s life—her determination and struggle—is the greatest lesson she has for them. They tell her they will sing in the rain if necessary. Just as they resolve to go forward, the rain stops. -Courtesy of The Glimmerglass Festival PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Review: onStage Pittsburgh - Dramady with Operatic Interludes Opens at the Byham Review: Tribune-Review - Pittsburgh Opera's 'Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson' is a performance to remember Review: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Operatic snapshot of a famous Pittsburgh singer sizzles with humor, drama Pittsburgh Magazine - Famous Opera Company Gets Its Own Opera Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Theater Guide April 2024 Pittsburgh Magazine - Things to Do in Pittsburgh This April The POP: The Pittsburgh Opera Podcast - THE PASSION OF MARY CARDWELL DAWSON - Artistic Coordinator Matthew Hrdlicka interviews Alyson Cambridge (Mary) and stage director Kimille Howard Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera's final show this season spotlights a local legend onStage Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera’s “The Passion of Mary Cadwell Dawson” Will Wrap Season 2023/24 KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh - \"Intersections\" April 21, 2024 (cast visit to National Opera House, starts at 16:30 of video) WESA-FM 90.5 - Play honors Pittsburgh's Black opera pioneer Mary Cardwell Dawson onStage Pittsburgh - 9 things to do this weekend in Pittsburgh WQED-FM Voice of the Arts Podcast interviews: Kimille Howard, stage director Christian Mark Gibbs, \"Frank\" Alyson Cambridge, \"Mary Cardwell Dawson\" Meroë Khalia Adeeb, \"Isabelle\" COMMUNITY EVENTS Join us for a series of FREE community events inspired by the life and legacy of Mary Cardwell Dawson: March 26: Family Day Event April 5: Opera Meets Jazz April 11: Honoring our Past, Connecting to our Present April 14: Panel Discussion 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

At dawn on Easter Sunday, Turiddu sings in the distance of his love for Lola, wife of the carter Alfio. She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza. Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed. PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people. ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking. ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. Act 1Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed by news that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. He offers his kingdom and Armida’s hand in marriage to the Christian knight Rinaldo if he agrees to fight against his fellow Christians. Enchanted and obsessed with Armida, Rinaldo vows to betray his men and his faith. Meanwhile, Armida, tormented by her passionate love for Rinaldo, pleads with the gods for his safety. Scene 2: A mountainside. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarca plan to rescue Rinaldo from Armida’s enchantment. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the Sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians. However, upon encountering Clotarca, Zelmira falls in love with her, despite her better judgment, and offers to lead her to safety. Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of Idreno’s approaching forces. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo about Armida’s charms and chastises him for abandoning his Christian duty. Though remorseful, Rinaldo remains unable to break free from Armida’s enchantment. Act 2Scene 1: Back in the council chamber. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarca's demand that the Christian knight enchanted by Armida be freed. Though the spell is broken, Rinaldo reluctantly leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury. Scene 2: Back at the mountainside. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo back as he prepares to rejoin the crusaders in battle. Armida arrives, pleading for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo, torn but resolute, departs for battle with Ubaldo, leaving Armida betrayed and alone. Act 3 Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, aware that the myrtle tree holds the secret to Armida’s powers, enters the grove to destroy it. Zelmira and a group of nymphs appear, attempting to persuade him to return to Armida. As Rinaldo raises his weapon to strike the myrtle, a disheveled Armida emerges from the tree and confronts him. Unable to kill Rinaldo despite her fury, she watches as he strikes the tree, causing the magic wood to fall lifeless. As Rinaldo tries to escape, he declares to still love her. Armida, consumed by fury, turns into a monster of rage, destroying all in her path.

These COVID protocols are subject to change, so we encourage you to check this webpage before every event you attend. This page is always up to date with our latest information. Pittsburgh Opera’s 2023-24 season performances and events are mask-friendly, meaning that anyone who would like to wear a mask is free to do so. We ask that all guests be respectful of one another's choices. Neither masks nor proof of vaccination are currently required for patrons attending any Pittsburgh Opera performances and events.

For example: The Barber of Seville (October 2023), The Flying Dutchman (November 2023), and La Traviata (March 2024) all take place at the Benedum Center, which is owned and operated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson (April-May 2024) takes place at the Byham, which is also a Cultural Trust venue. The Cultural Trust has a webpage devoted to its COVID policies. Iphigénie en Tauride (January 2024) will be performed at the Pittsburgh CAPA School Theater, which is part of the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS). PPS has its own policies which are separate from Pittsburgh Opera’s, and which all patrons and Pittsburgh Opera personnel must adhere to. Currently PPS requires masks if Allegheny County is considered to be in a High COVID transmission level, and recommends them in Medium transmission levels.

SEEN hails it as “one of the best black-tie galas in town” and by the Tribune-Review as one of Pittsburgh’s top parties of the year. Each year, this event is a critical aspect of Pittsburgh Opera’s fundraising efforts to keep music alive in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. Annually, Maecenas galas celebrate a successful season for Pittsburgh Opera and recognize individuals who have contributed significantly to the performing arts in Pittsburgh or within their respective fields. Each year, a few worthy recipients receive Awards from Pittsburgh Opera.

Audio Commentary Service Pittsburgh Opera offers an Audio Commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the Tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified). Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling 412-281-0912, extension 213. An all-volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices.

Bob and Chris are long-standing supporters of Pittsburgh Opera, and of the arts in general. Chris recalls falling in love with opera at a young age. “Opera was always on the radio when we would visit my grandparents.” They have earmarked their gift towards some of their favorite operas. One is The Barber of Seville, which will be performed at downtown Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center this October. “I grew up on Looney Tunes”, said Bob, “and loved the Bugs Bunny ‘Long Haired Hare’ episode, which uses music from The Barber of Seville. Most people know that music, even if they don’t realize what it’s originally from.” Another opera benefitting from their gift is Verdi’s La Traviata, which will be performed at the Benedum Center in March, 2024. “The music moves you,” says Chris. “Being able to see and hear it performed live on stage right in front of you is very special. We want to help ensure that others can have that experience.” “Pittsburgh Opera is extremely grateful to Bob and Chris for their stalwart support,” said General Director Christopher Hahn. “Their gift helps us expose new members of the community to our art form.” The Pietrandreas have already converted some skeptics. They invited some first-time opera-goers to a recent performance of Pittsburgh Opera’s The Marriage of Figaro which they sponsored. “Our friends were surprised to find that they really enjoyed it”, said Bob. Both Bob and Chris strongly believe that the arts enrich everyone’s lives, and that there is real value in being exposed to opera. “Beauty enriches us all,” said Chris. “People who can support the arts have a responsibility to do so, to help benefit the entire community.” For information on sponsoring any of Pittsburgh Operas productions, please contact Rachel Kisic, Assistant Director of Development for Individual Giving, at 412.281.0912 x 226, or via email. Contributions to Pittsburgh Opera are tax-deductible.

Only the love of the doting Alfredo can sweep her away from these sensual delights. But while she is a trophy to be won amongst the balls and frivolities of Paris, she is nothing but a scandalous “fallen woman” to genteel society. Violetta and Alfredo’s love threatens to bring shame to his family and ruin his sister's marriage prospects. In secret, Alfredo’s father presses Violetta to shun Alfredo and save the family’s reputation. Heartbroken and health failing, Violetta retreats to her old life of empty pleasures. As her illness worsens, will love slip away as well? Verdi’s exquisite tragedy juxtaposes rousing numbers like the joyous Brindisi with heart-wrenching arias to create a shattering emotional portrait like no other. These performances are sponsored in part by a generous gift from Robert and Christine Pietrandrea, and by The Gailliot Fund.

Made available courtesy of Utah Symphony | Utah Opera SYNOPSIS Violetta Valéry is hosting a lively party at her beautiful Paris apartment. Flora arrives late with a small group and everyone sits for dinner. Gastone introduces Violetta to Alfredo Germont, an admirer who has long adored her from afar. Alfredo flirts with her in a rousing drinking song, the famous Brindisi “Libiamo ne’lieti calici”. Alfredo confesses to Violetta that he has loved her for more than a year. Moved, Violetta attempts to warn him, saying that she “doesn’t know how to love” but he is undeterred. Later, Violetta seriously considers his proposal but then vows that she wants to remain \"sempre libera\" - always free. Alfredo eventually wins Violetta over, and they move to a house in the country. Alfredo sings about how happy he has been ever since Violetta told him “I want to live, faithful to you alone.” However, Alfredo’s father Giorgio Germont disapproves of Violetta’s relationship with Alfredo, which threatens his family’s reputation and his daughter’s engagement. He coerces Violetta into breaking up with Alfredo, then returns to console his son. But Alfredo discovers that Violetta has gone to Flora's masquerade and he returns to Paris to confront her there. At the party, Violetta soon appears on the arm of the Baron, to whom she has returned in an effort to break permanently with Alfredo. After winning a great deal of money, Alfredo confronts Violetta. She lies and says that she no longer loves him, but loves the Baron instead. Enraged, Alfredo calls everyone to witness as he throws the money at Violetta. Germont chastises his son and the Baron challenges Alfredo to a duel. Several months later, Violetta, now destitute and abandoned, is dying of tuberculosis. In a letter she learns that Germont has finally confessed his plot to Alfredo, who is returning to reconcile with her. Their joyful reunion is soon overshadowed by her illness. Violetta bids farewell “to happy dreams of by-gone days.” Alfredo's father also returns with the Doctor, but it is too late.

The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. FAQS Where is the childcare provided? The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service. What are the age limits? The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Do I need to buy a ticket for my child who will be using the childcare service? Yes, but it's free. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Please use the process shown in the \"How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase\" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done? Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the \"Liability Waiver\" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. When do I drop off and pick up my child? The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS. After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts? No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance. Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use? Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. Will there be food provided? Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication? No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.

The Summer King tells the story of baseball legend Josh Gibson. Josh went from the sandlots of Pittsburgh’s North Side to the pinnacle of greatness in the Negro Leagues, before ultimately being enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. The opera begins with a father and son debating about great baseball players. When the father mentions Josh Gibson, the son thinks his father is living in the past. But as his father retorts, “Who’s got those numbers today?” The Summer King follows Josh at key points in his life, including his playing days in the Negro Leagues as well as in Mexico, where he was awarded the MVP award while playing for the Veracruz Azules. The robust supporting characters include his wife Helen, who dies in childbirth, his girlfriend Grace, sung by the legendary Denyce Graves in her Pittsburgh Opera debut, and teammates such as Sam Bankhead and Cool Papa Bell. Also featured in prominent roles are the gregarious Gus Greenlee, who owned not just the Pittsburgh Crawfords but also the legendary Crawford Grill in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, and Wendell Smith, an intrepid reporter for the celebrated African American newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier. Like all African Americans at the time, Josh was prohibited from playing in the Major Leagues by what was disingenuously referred to as a “gentlemen’s agreement” among the Major League clubs. Sadly, Josh died at the age of 35, felled by a stroke shortly before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Pittsburgh Opera is proud and privileged to premiere The Summer King, Josh Gibson’s story.

But he was overlooked by the mainstream white media because of the color of his skin. These Pittsburgh sports legends are appearing as supernumeraries in The Summer King. Their participation symbolizes that while Josh's athletic greatness may have gone unnoticed by much of the general public, Pittsburgh's sports heroes recognize him as one of their own.

Cuomo,Directed by Jonathan Moore • February 17, 20, 23 & 25, 2018 \"BREAKING BAD meets Samuel Beckett...a journey to a Dante-esque underworld.\" Pittsburgh Opera is proud to produce our second world premiere in two years. Savage Winter (formerly called Ashes & Snow), composed by Douglas J. Cuomo and directed by Jonathan Moore, is based on Wilhelm Müller’s 24 poem cycle used as the text for Franz Schubert’s famous Winterreise (“Winter Journey”). The 24 poems and songs of the Winterreise tell an anguished story of lost love, through what is essentially a single dramatic monologue, sung here by Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist tenor Eric Ferring. The protagonist (Eric Ferring) reminisces about a Linden Tree, a reminder of happier days. Savage Winter is set in the present day, and unfolds in a run-down motel room in the desert of the American West. The protagonist must confront his demons and face up to everything he has done, and all he has lost, in his life. He is searching for forgiveness, enlightenment and atonement. Mr. Ferring will be accompanied by three on-stage musicians, led from the piano by Pittsburgh Opera Director of Musical Studies Mark Trawka. Also included is a trumpet, an electric guitar played by the composer himself, and electronic sound effects. The musical style is ‘21st century art-song,’ infused with acid jazz and punk energy, to create a very raw and emotional experience. BREAKING BAD is a trademark of Sony Pictures Television Inc.

Along the way he experiences a turmoil of different emotions, mostly ranging from despair to greater despair.” - Jeanell Carrigan The following brief synopsis of each of the Winterreise’s 24 poems is adapted from Wikipedia. \"Good Night\": “A stranger I arrived; a stranger I depart.” In May, he won the love of a girl and hoped to marry her. But now the world is dreary, and he must leave, in winter, in the dead of night, finding his own way in the trackless snow. He writes “Good Night” on her gate as he passes to show he thought of her. \"The Weathervane\": The weathervane on her house creaks in the shifting winds, mocking him and showing the inconstant hearts inside. “What do they care about my suffering? Their child is a wealthy bride!” \"Frozen Tears\": He notices he has been crying and chides his tears for being only lukewarm so that they freeze. They come out of his heart hot enough to melt all the winter’s ice! \"Numbness\": He looks in vain for her footprints beneath the snow where she once walked with him through the green meadow; he wants to melt away the snow and ice with his tears. He has nothing to remember her by except his pain. She is frozen in his heart; if it thaws, her image will flow away. \"The Linden Tree\": The tree, a reminder of happier days, seems to call him, promising rest. But he turns away, into the cold wind. And now, miles away, he still hears it calling him: “Here you would find peace.” \"Flood Water\": The cold snow thirstily sucks up his tears; when the warm winds blow, the snow and ice will melt, and the brook will carry them through the town to where his sweetheart lives. \"On the River\": The gaily rushing river lies silent under a hard crust. In the ice, he carves a memorial to their love. The river is an image of his heart swelling up powerfully beneath the frozen surface. \"A Backwards Glance\": He recounts his headlong flight from the town and recalls his springtime arrival in the “city of inconstancy,” and two girlish eyes that captivated him. When he thinks of that time, he would like to go back and stand silently in front of her house. \"Will o’ the Wisp\": The false light of the will-o’-the-wisp has led him astray, but he’s used to that. Every path leads to the same goal. Our joys and sorrows are but a trick of the light. Every stream reaches the sea, every sorrow its grave. \"Rest\": Only now that he has stopped to rest does he realize how tired & sore he is. And in the quiet he feels for the first time the “worm” which stings him inwardly. \"Dream of Spring\": He dreams of springtime and love, but wakes to cold and darkness and the shrieking of ravens. He sees frost leaves painted on the window. When will they turn green? When will he again embrace his beloved? \"Solitude\": He wanders, like a sad and lonely cloud, through the bright and happy life around him. “Even when the storms were raging. I was not so miserable.” \"The Post\": He hears a postal horn. “Why does my heart leap up so? There’s no letter for you! But maybe there’s some news of her?” \"The Gray Head\": Frost has turned his hair gray and he rejoices at being an old man. But when it thaws, he is horrified to be a youth again: “How far it is still to the grave.” \"The Crow\": A crow has been following him. It has never left him, expecting to take his body as its prey. “It won’t be much longer now. Crow, show me constancy unto death!” \"Last Hope\": He gambles on a leaf quivering in the wind. If it falls from the tree, all his hopes are dashed. He falls to the ground himself and weeps over the “grave” of his hopes. \"In the Village\": Dogs bark, and all the people are asleep, dreaming of success and failure, finding on their pillows what eluded them in life. “I am done with all dreaming. Why should I linger among the sleepers?” \"The Stormy Morning\": The storm is an image of his heart, wild and cold like the winter. \"Illusion\": A dancing light wants to lead him astray, and he is glad to go along. “Behind ice and night and horror” it shows him a warm, bright house and a loving wife within. Illusion is all he has to go on. \"The Signpost\": “Why do I take secret ways and avoid the other travelers? I’ve committed no crime. What foolish desire drives me to seek the wastelands?” He journeys endlessly, seeking peace and finding none. A signpost points the way: “I must travel a road where no one has ever yet returned.” \"The Inn\": He comes to a graveyard and wants to enter. But all the rooms in this “inn” are taken; he resolves to go on his way with his faithful walking-stick. \"Courage\": He shakes the snow from his face and sings cheerfully to silence his heart’s stirrings, striding into the world, against wind and weather: “If there’s no God on earth, then we ourselves are gods!” \"The False Suns\": He sees three suns staring at him in the sky. “You are not my suns! Once I too had three, but the best two have now set. If only the third would follow, I’ll be happier in the darkness.” \"The Hurdy-Gurdy Man\": Back of the village stands a hurdy-gurdy man (organ grinder), cranking his instrument with frozen fingers. His begging bowl is always empty; no one listens, and the dogs growl at him. But his playing never stops. “Strange old man. Shall I come with you? Will you play your hurdy-gurdy to accompany my songs?” PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Here's what other people are saying about Savage Winter (previously called Ashes & Snow): Opera Wire: Ashes & Snow to World Premiere at Pittsburgh Opera Broadway World: Pittsburgh Opera Presents The World Premiere of Ashes & Snow Trib Live: Entertainment Planner: Feb 8-21 Pittsburgh Magazine: Top Ten Things to Do in Pittsburgh in February Pittsburgh Owl Scribe: Ashes and Snow - \"BREAKING BAD meets Samuel Beckett\" LOCAL Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Opera’s Second World Premiere Goes Intimate with Ashes & Snow Pittsburgh in the Round: Eric Ferring on Pittsburgh Opera’s Ashes & Snow Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Ashes and Snow is man's psychological journey to oblivion and redemption WQED: Voice of the Arts podcasts Stage Director Jonathan Moore Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn Composer Douglas Cuomo Tenor Eric Ferring WQXR 105.9 FM, New York City’s classical music radio station: Operavore - A World of New Operas Trib Live: Event Planner: Feb. 15 - 28 City Paper: Short List, Feb. 15-22 Burgh Vivant: video interview - ERIC FERRING – Tenor, ASHES & SNOW, Pittsburgh Opera Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh: Staff Picks - A Story of Lost Love Trib Live: Pittsburgh Opera presents world premiere of Ashes and Snow 90.5 WESA-FM, Pittsburgh's NPR News Station: Pittsburgh Opera Goes Electric With World-Premiere Of Ashes & Snow Pittsburgh in the Round: Review- Ashes & Snow Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Review: Pittsburgh Opera's 'Ashes & Snow' Broadway World: Photo Flash - Inside Pittsburgh Opera's ASHES & SNOW Radio 3, Rome, Italy: Momus il caffè dell'Opera - Douglas Cuomo OperaWire: Top 5 Operas to See This Weekend – North America (2/23-25) Classical Voice North America: Opera Inspired By Winterreise Makes Powerful Theater VIDEO EXCERPTS The Protagonist dreams of springtime and love, but wakes to cold and darkness and the shrieking of ravens.

SYNOPSIS As explained more fully in the libretto available for free download, As One tells the story and struggle of the transgender protagonist, Hannah, as she tries to reconcile the discord between herself and the outside world. As One traces Hannah’s experiences from her youth in a small town to her college years on the West Coast, and finally to Norway where she is surprised at what she learns about herself. From the libretto: Part I In “Paper route,” Hannah rides around her suburban neighborhood delivering newspapers and revels in her more feminine impulses. Her youthful challenges in conforming to gender norms are related in “Cursive,” “Sex ed,” “Entire of itself ” and “Perfect boy”—in such disparate subjects as handwriting, sex, a John Donne poem, and exemplary male behavior. However, in “To know,” she discovers that she is not alone in the world and seeks understanding about herself at a local library. Part II During her college years, Hannah struggles with her bifurcated existence in “Two cities,” but also encounters the joy of being perceived as she wishes in “Three words.” In “Close,” she has made the decision to undergo hormone therapy and briefly suffers its vertiginous effects before feeling at one with her own body. “Home for the holidays,” “A christmas story” and “Dear son” all occur around the Christmas season and relate Hannah’s growing distance to her family and her past, which is countered by an immediate connection with a stranger in a local café. In “Out of nowhere,” Hannah escapes a harrowing assault that prompts her to find a link to the larger trans community and end her self-imposed alienation. Reacting to the conflicting voices in her head, she finally resolves to escape in the fragment, “I go on to…” Part III “Norway.” In this extended aria, Hannah finds, in Nature, solitude, and self-reflection, the simple yet surprising equation that will help her achieve happiness.

A violent encounter between a man, a woman, and a notorious brigand. Seven testimonies, each proposing a different perspective on the crime. Akutagawa’s classic short story “In a Grove,” which inspired the plot of Kurosawa’s renowned film Rashomon, offers a searing investigation into the impossibility and elusiveness of truth. Epic and intimate, timeless and devastatingly timely, the story’s structure lends itself powerfully to music’s ability to conjure—via repetition and variation—how human perception, memory, and desire are fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Join us for this unique world-premiere experience in a place where the ground shifts beneath your feet—a space of ambiguity and clarity, of beauty and menace, and of fragility and strength.

We, the audience, are the silent, unseen interlocutor, gathering testimony from seven witnesses—potential perpetrators of a crime. A woodcutter states that he found a body in the grove, on the mountain where he goes to cut wood. A priest testifies that he passed a man leading a woman on a horse along the Foundry Post Road. A policeman recounts his arrest of Luther Harlow, a local vigilante, who some say is responsible for the spate of women gone missing from the mountain. A woman describes her daughter, Leona, an aspiring botanist, whose new husband, Ambrose, a schoolteacher, appears to have been murdered. The mother pleads with the interlocutor to find the girl, who is missing. Luther Harlow confesses. Taken by the beauty of a young woman he encountered along the mountain road, he had tried to lure the girl and her husband into a nearby grove, promising treasure. As Luther tells his story, he relives the events: The girl resists Luther’s ruse, but her husband, eager to regale his new bride with pretty trinkets, follows Luther into the grove. Luther quickly disposes of the young man, and when Leona discovers her husband bound and gagged, she pulls a knife on Luther, who wrestles her to the ground, intending to assault the girl. But she slips from his grasp, pelting Luther with a rock, knocking him out just long enough for her to free her husband, arming him with her knife. Ambrose is hesitant at first, but Leona urges him to fight. Although the schoolteacher is no match for the vigilante, he somehow holds his own. Soon enough, however, Ambrose’s strength wanes. Leona intervenes by shooting Ambrose’s rifle into the air, and in the confusion, Luther stabs him, grabs the gun and flees, leaving him for dead. Leona reluctantly delivers her testimony: of having encountered a dubious man on the mountain road; of her husband Ambrose’s misguided desire to follow the stranger into the grove; of being left to wait alone in the gloam, calling on the relics of the ghost forest for protection. When the man returns without Ambrose, she follows, terrified of what has befallen her husband. In the grove, Luther attempts to assault her, but she eludes him, hurling a stone at him, freeing Ambrose so that he can defend them both. Ambrose hesitates, and she lashes out at him. Ambrose has no choice but to fight a losing battle. Leona again steps in, pointing Ambrose’s rifle to the sky and firing. In the tumult, the marauder disappears, and Leona discovers that her husband is bleeding. She gathers medicinal plants to staunch the wound. But as she tends to Ambrose, he jealously rebukes her, accusing her of having consorted with Luther. Thrown by his anger, she balks, and in that moment he expires. Believing she killed him, she tries, over and over again to take her own life, but fails. Leona confesses that she murdered her husband. A medium channels the dead man, who articulates the secret Ambrose was never able to tell his new bride—that his heart has always been weak, ever since suffering from rheumatic fever as a small child. The medium and Ambrose relive the incidents leading up to Ambrose’s death from his perspective, tormented by the fact that in his final moments, he allowed his wife to believe it was she who killed him, rather than his failing heart. CREATORS STATEMENTS IN A GROVE opens with a wash of white noise—a sonic representation of wildfire and smoke. As the opera progresses, rhythms, harmonies, motives, and eventually melodies emerge out of this aural fog, mirroring the way facts emerge, piece by piece, in this musical detective story. As our characters relate their tales, motives and melodies recur, but they also evolve, paralleling each narrator’s shifting perspective. A throwaway melody in Luther’s scene becomes the basis for Leona’s aria in hers; finally, this melody becomes the core of the final confession, a duet between a Medium and Ambrose. Throughout the work, the voices are transformed electronically. I tried to exemplify remembrance’s flawed roughness by distorting the voices using reverb, pitch-shifting, and, granulation—effects that suggest that our characters’ memories are flawed, foggy, or plain wrong. In setting out to compose IN A GROVE, I tried to take something unconventional—a story told over and over again from different perspectives—and marry it to something familiar: music, where themes, repetition, and variation help us navigate and understand this mysterious tale. —Christopher Cerrone What we discovered in the process of making IN A GROVE is that Leona is the heart of the story. And that truth is not just prismatic, elusive, and fallible, it is personal, emotional, razor-edged. The truths and untruths that we perceive, gloss over, embrace, refute or deny drive the trajectories of our lives. The uncanny weave of opacity and transparencies so aptly conjured in Akutagawa’s remarkable tale makes up the fabric of lived experience. The story’s form, that of seven testimonies, asks us to listen differently—to approach narrative, language, image and sound in new ways, and in so doing, perhaps, to see and hear anew. Obfuscation is pervasive, and yet the crystalline architecture of Chris’s music serves as a revelatory container for the ineffable. Mary’s exquisite staging plunges us into an ever-shifting grove sited within a ghost forest in the Pacific Northwest, a setting that mines a series of profoundly American truths. —Stephanie Fleischmann 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

On the run after a series of tragic incidents, five North Philadelphia teens find refuge in an abandoned, condemned house in West Philadelphia at the exact location that served as headquarters of the MOVE organization, where a 1985 standoff with police infamously ended with a neighborhood destroyed and 11 people dead, including five children. This self-defined family is assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home and begin to see their squatting as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear. Combining spoken word, contemporary movement, video projection, classical, R&B, and jazz singing, and a brooding, often joyful score filled with place, purpose, and possibility, We Shall Not Be Moved is a timely exploration of past and present struggles that suggests an alternate future through the eyes of its young protagonists. Viswa Subbaraman conducts. Tony Award-winner and Kennedy Center Honoree Bill T. Jones directs and choreographs. Production co-produced by Opera Philadelphia, The Apollo Theater, and Hackney Empire. Developed in partnership with Art Sanctuary.Support for this production comes from the National Endowment for the Arts.

SYNOPSIS - CONTAINS SPOILERS ACT I On the run after a series of tragic incidents, five North Philly teens ( John Henry, John Blue, John Little, John Mack, and Un/Sung) find refuge in an abandoned, condemned house in West Philadelphia. The home sits at the exact location of the headquarters of the MOVE organization before it was infamously burned to the ground in a 1985 police confrontation that left 11 people dead and no government officials indicted or meaningfully reprimanded. The teens are assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home (who we refer to as the OGs), and begin to see their squatting in the home as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear or precarious circumstance. Into this mix enters Glenda, a north Philly native turned West Philly cop who patrols this quiet stretch of Osage Avenue on her regular beat. Glenda observes that the young people have taken over the home and are “hanging out” there when they are supposed to be in school. She moves determinedly to sweep the kids out of the home, threatening them with arrest and ridiculing their intentions. But in a chaotic accident, she moves too far and mistakenly discharges her firearm, injuring one of the teens. In her temporary shock, Glenda is overrun by the other young people, who turn the tables on the situation by pointing Glenda’s own gun at her and subsequently handcuffing her to a chair in the center of the house. ACT II John Henry lays bleeding in a pool of sorrow, confronted at a desperately young age with his own mortality. All parties are now frightened, disoriented, and vulnerable, and the only sense of empowerment in this bleak moment comes from the OGs who infuse the home with a spirituality that is palpably felt by the young people in particular. Glenda challenges the validity of this ‘movement of holy ghosts,’ but cannot deny that whatever the origins, the young people, led by the sole female-identified teen, Un/Sung, are clearly operating from a place of conviction. Still suspicious and driven by her vulnerable position, Glenda probes this conviction, intimating that the teens are not motivated by principle alone. Finally the teens succumb to the reality of the moment: their brother has been wounded and is in need of help, and the most expedient way to help him is to leave the house. They decide to reveal to Glenda the circumstances that drove them to squat in the house on Osage. They think Glenda has something to hide (firing at an unarmed teen) and so do they, and if they come clean with their story, the combination of transparency and quid pro quo may grant them safe, unreported passage out of the house. However, in revealing the origins of their plight, they also realize that a young man who John Blue has killed is Glenda’s own brother, Manny. ACT III The family confers feverishly about the increasingly limited options for their next move, concluding that the best “survival” tactic is to “disappear” Glenda altogether. Un/Sung commits to completing the task, instructing her brothers to leave quickly for a predetermined location to avoid any further witnesses while she does “something awful.” A confrontation between the young girl and Glenda ensues, concluding with silence, complete darkness in the theater, and the assumption of injury. When the lights come all the way up, the family has vanished, and the house on Osage Avenue has burned to the ground. Glenda tells an interviewer the story of her waning moments with the family from a plane above the action, but we watch a different story unfolding at eye level. All the players are setting the house on “fire,” not with kerosene or grand flames, but with small, glass-framed candles. The image is not of arson, but of ritual. The Family is turning the home into an altar, perhaps an instrument of forgiving, of letting go, of release, and of renewal. As the lights come down for the final time, the last remaining image on stage is of the skeleton of a house, lit up like a shrine, while the OGs move around it in holy rites.

ACT I Three ladies in the service of the Queen of the Night save Prince Tamino from a serpent. When they leave to tell the queen, the birdcatcher Papageno appears. He boasts to Tamino that it was he who killed the creature. The ladies return to give Tamino a portrait of the queen’s daughter, Pamina, who they say has been enslaved by the evil Sarastro. Tamino immediately falls in love with the girl’s picture. The queen, appearing in a burst of thunder, tells Tamino about the loss of her daughter and commands him to rescue her. The ladies give a magic flute to Tamino and silver bells to Papageno to ensure their safety on the journey and appoint three spirits to guide them. Sarastro’s slave Monostatos pursues Pamina but is frightened away by Papageno. The birdcatcher tells Pamina that Tamino loves her and is on his way to save her. Led by the three spirits to the temple of Sarastro, Tamino learns from a high priest that it is the Queen, not Sarastro, who is evil. Hearing that Pamina is safe, Tamino charms the wild animals with his flute, then rushes off to follow the sound of Papageno’s pipes. Monostatos and his men chase Papageno and Pamina but are left helpless when Papageno plays his magic bells. Sarastro enters in great ceremony. He punishes Monostatos and promises Pamina that he will eventually set her free. Pamina catches a glimpse of Tamino, who is led into the temple with Papageno. ACT II Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino will undergo initiation rites. Monostatos tries to kiss the sleeping Pamina but is surprised by the appearance of the Queen of the Night. The Queen gives her daughter a dagger and orders her to murder Sarastro. Sarastro finds the desperate Pamina and consoles her, explaining that he is not interested in vengeance. Tamino and Papageno are told by a priest that they must remain silent and are not allowed to eat, a vow that Papageno immediately breaks when he takes a glass of water from a flirtatious old lady. When he asks her name, the old lady vanishes. The three spirits appear to guide Tamino through the rest of his journey and to tell Papageno to be quiet. Tamino remains silent even when Pamina appears. Misunderstanding his vow for coldness, she is heartbroken. The priests inform Tamino that he has only two more trials to complete his initiation. Papageno, who has given up on entering the brotherhood, longs for a wife instead. He eventually settles for the old lady. When he promises to be faithful, she turns into a beautiful young Papagena, but immediately disappears. Pamina and Tamino are reunited and face the ordeals of water and fire together, protected by the magic flute. Papageno tries to poison himself but is saved by the three spirits, who remind him that if he uses his magic bells he will find true happiness. When he plays the bells, Papagena appears and the two start making family plans.The Queen of the Night, her three ladies, and Monostatos attack the temple but are defeated and banished. Sarastro blesses Pamina and Tamino as all join in hailing the triumph of courage, virtue, and wisdom. - Adapted from The Metropolitan Opera DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Forever changed, the Elf resolves to give closure to the victim’s Beloved. Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, The Rose Elf takes you to a world where a tiny elf lives happily and contently in the protective petals of a beautiful rose. When the flower closes one night before the Elf returns home, the Elf seeks shelter in some nearby honeysuckle. There, the Elf overhears the Girl and her Beloved exchange tender goodbyes, as the Beloved prepares for a lengthy journey. After the Beloved embarks, the Elf watches in horror as the Brother brutally murders the Beloved and buries him beneath a linden tree.The Elf whispers the truth to the Girl while she sleeps, leaving her a leaf from the linden tree to convince her that their message was not a dream. When she awakens, the Girl pursues the terrible truth, even though it could destroy her. Join us for the Pittsburgh premiere of David Hertzberg’s hauntingly beautiful opera The Rose Elf. The New Yorker says its music “blooms with warmth and depth”, and OperaWire praises Hertzberg as “masterful at using a minimal number of instrumentalists to create gargantuan sound.” Developed through Opera Philadelphia’s Double Exposure program in 2016 and 2018, The Rose Elf premiered on June 6, 2018 in the catacombs of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, in a production by R.B. Schlather. These will be its second-ever performances. The Rose Elf is sponsored in part by a gift from an anonymous donor.

A garden in ripest bloom. Midday, the sun is shining.The elf, a strange, sensuous being who dwells within the roses, lies inside a blossom, caressing its petals, breathing its fragrance. They leave to frolic in the garden, tracing the paths in the veins of a linden leaf. When they return to rest at nightfall, the rose has closed in the cold. Seeking shelter, they happen on a bower, wherein two human lovers exchange mournful goodbyes. The girl gives her lover a rose, which opens from the warmth of her kiss, and the elf crawls inside. As the lover treks through the dark forest, he caresses and kisses the gifted rose, scorching and smothering the elf inside, when suddenly, he is murdered in cold blood, with the elf as witness. The elf then visits the girl in sleep and tells her the grisly tale: her brother has killed her lover. The girl wakes and exhumes her lover’s body from the forest. The elf returns to the garden and finds their rose has wilted.II. Winter. The girl’s room. Wan light.The girl has interred her beloved in a pot with jasmine sprigs. The elf watches from a potted rose on her windowsill as she waters the jasmine flowers with her tears. Her brother enters; the elf listens as he mocks her, asks her vainly why she cries over the pot. As the girl withers away, the elf is moved to console her; they crawl into her ear and whispers to her about the garden, the roses, and the elves that dwell within them. The girl passes peacefully, and the elf returns to a new rose in the garden. The brother returns and takes the pot from under her lifeless head, brings it to his room, and as the curtain falls slowly, the silhouettes of the jasmine flowers grow and blossom.

Fiery free-spirit Carmen, who lives her life to the fullest, can have any man she wants. But when she seduces naïve Corporal Don José, she gets more than she bargains for. Carmen works in a cigarette factory. When a knife fight with another employee leads to her arrest, she charms Corporal Don José into letting her escape. Like a moth drawn to a flame, Don José forsakes his military career and the innocent peasant girl Micaëla for a life on the lam with Carmen and a band of smugglers. Never one to settle down, the passionate Carmen gets bored with Don José and becomes involved with the glamourous, testosterone-filled bullfighter Escamillo. Left with nothing, Don José decides that if he can’t have Carmen, no one can. Full of magnetic melodies, colorful costumes, and tragic twists, you’ll fall in love with George Bizet’s one-and-only Carmen. Antony Walker conducts; Garnett Bruce directs.

In Seville by a cigarette factory, soldiers comment on the townspeople. Among them is Micaëla, a peasant girl, who asks for a corporal named Don José. Moralès, another corporal, tells her he will return with the changing of the guard. The relief guard, headed by Lieutenant Zuniga, soon arrives, and José learns from Moralès that Micaëla has been looking for him. When the factory bell rings, the men of Seville gather to watch the female workers— especially their favorite, Carmen. She tells her admirers that love is free and obeys no rules (\"L’amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). Only one man pays no attention to her: Don José. Carmen throws a flower at him, and the girls go back to work. José picks up the flower and hides it when Micaëla returns. She brings a letter from José’s mother, who lives in a village in the countryside (\"Ma mere, je la vois\"). As he begins to read the letter, Micaëla leaves. José is about to throw away the flower when a fight erupts inside the factory between Carmen and another girl. Zuniga sends José to retrieve Carmen. She refuses to answer Zuniga’s questions, and José is ordered to take her to prison. Left alone with him, she entices Jose with suggestions of a rendezvous at Lillas Pastia’s tavern (\"Près des remparts de Séville\"). Mesmerized, he agrees to let her get away. As they leave for prison, Carmen escapes. Don José is arrested. ACT II. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès entertain the guests at the tavern (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\"). Zuniga tells Carmen that José has just been released. The bullfighter Escamillo enters, boasting about the pleasures of his profession (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\"), and flirts with Carmen, who tells him that she is involved with someone else. After the tavern guests have left with Escamillo, the smugglers Dancaïre and Remendado explain their latest scheme to the women (\"Nous avons en tête une affaire\"). Frasquita and Mercédès are willing to help, but Carmen refuses because she is in love. The smugglers withdraw as José approaches. Carmen arouses José's jealousy by telling him how she danced for Zuniga. She dances for him now, but when a bugle call is heard he says he must return to the barracks (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur\"). Carmen mocks him. To prove his love, José shows her the flower she threw at him and confesses how its scent made him not lose hope during the weeks in prison (\"La fleur que tu m’avais jetée\"). She is unimpressed: if he really loved her, he would desert the army and join her in a life of freedom in the mountains. José refuses, and Carmen tells him to leave. Zuniga bursts in, and in a jealous rage José fights him. The smugglers return and disarm Zuniga. José now has no choice but to join them. ACT III. Carmen and José quarrel in the smugglers’ mountain hideaway. She admits that her love is fading and advises him to return to live with his mother. When Frasquita and Mercédès turn the cards to tell their fortunes, they foresee love and riches for themselves, but Carmen’s cards spell death—for her and for José (\"Melons! Coupons!\"). Micaëla appears, frightened by the mountains and afraid to meet the woman who has turned José into a criminal (\"Je dis que rien ne m’épouvante\"). She hides when a shot rings out. José has fired at an intruder, who turns out to be Escamillo. He tells José that he has come to find Carmen, and the two men fight (\"Je suis Escamillo\"). The smugglers separate them, and Escamillo invites everyone, Carmen in particular, to his next bullfight. When he has left, Micaëla emerges and begs José to return home. He agrees when he learns that his mother is dying, but before he leaves he warns Carmen that they will meet again. ACT IV. Back in Seville, the crowd cheers the bullfighters on their way to the arena (\"A deux cuartos\"). Carmen arrives on Escamillo’s arm, and Frasquita and Mercédès warn her that Jose is nearby. Unafraid, she waits outside the entrance as the crowds enter the arena. Jose appears and begs Carmen to forget the past and start a new life with him (\"C’est toi! C’est moi!\"). She calmly tells him that their affair is over: she was born free and free she will die. The crowd is heard cheering Escamillo. José keeps trying to win Carmen back. She takes off his ring and throws it at his feet before heading for the arena. José stabs her to death. - Adapated from Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances! Here are some details and resources to help.

As the boy grows into a young man, he becomes a student artist and activist. His mother worries for his future, while his father tries to prepare him for the harsh realities of 21st-century America. The father also wrestles with his own identity as a police officer, a \"Black man in blue\", and the friction that causes within the family. When their deepest fears come true, the grieving parents must navigate the turbulent waters of loss at the hands of police, while seeking answers and support from their church and community. Tony Award®–winning composer Jeanine Tesori and NAACP Theatre Award–winning librettist Tazewell Thompson’s new opera is inspired by contemporary events and Black literature. Exploring race, violence, and reconciliation, Blue places timely issues at the forefront of modern opera and invites audiences to the emotional epicenter of their impact. Glenn Lewis conducts. Tazewell Thompson directs, with Cindy C. Oxberry as Associate Director. Blue was commissioned by The Glimmerglass Festival and premiered in July, 2019.The scenery and costumes were originally created for a co-production with The Glimmerglass Festival, Washington National Opera, and Lyric Opera of Chicago.

SYNOPSIS (CONTAINS SPOILERS) Synopsis - warning, contains spoilers The Mother calls her Girlfriends together to her apartment in Harlem to tell them she is expecting a child. Their joy turns to concern when she tells them she is carrying a boy; they warn her that her son will not be welcomed in this country. When her hope and love – for the child she carries and for The Father, a policeman – will not be shaken, her Girlfriends relent, blessing her and the child. The Father’s police officer buddies, on the other hand, are immediately joyful – and a bit jealous – when they learn their fellow officer has fathered a son. Sixteen years later, The Son, a student artist and activist, frequently finds himself at odds with the law for his involvement with non-violent political protests. The Father confronts The Son, who pushes back, accusing his police officer Father of upholding an oppressive system. Despite The Son’s bitter words, The Father tells him he will always love him and hold him close. After The Son is shot by a police officer at a protest, the heartbroken Father meets with The Reverend, who attempts to comfort him and encourages him to forgive. The Father, adopting the attitude of The Son, lashes out angrily. As the funeral for The Son approaches, The Girlfriends return to Harlem to support the grief-stricken Mother as she prepares to lay her son to rest. At the funeral, Father and Mother pray with the congregation, asking God to welcome their son to Heaven. The Father briefly becomes lost in a fog of emotion, guilt, regret and memory, then finds his way back to the community gathered around him in church. In an epilogue, we see The Father, The Mother and The Son, together, in a bittersweet moment around a kitchen table, sharing a meal, as The Son reconciles with his father and announces his plans for further artistic studies and one more peaceful protest. - from the Glimmerglass Festival FURTHER READING These materials were compiled by the Glimmerglass Festival Online Resources Campaign Zero advocates for policies – informed by data, research and human rights principles – to change the way police serve communities. Race Forward brings systemic analysis and an innovative approach to complex race issues to help people take effective action toward racial equity. Race Forward offers online resources as well as in-person trainings. The United Nations offers a variety of resources for combatting racism. The Center for Popular Democracy and Policy Link, two nonprofit advocacy organizations, partnered with various protesters and street-level organizers to identify concrete steps toward promoting justice and equity in law enforcement. Highlights from their report were published by mic.com as “15 Things Your City Can Do Right Now to End Police Brutality.” Articles and Essays to Read Online Letter to My Son First published in The Atlantic, this adapted excerpt from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ book Between the World and Me finds him explaining the construction of race and its inseparable ties with the idea of an American national identity. Interweaving history with personal anecdotes, Coates’ moving letter depicts the institutionalized racism that both forms and punishes black bodies, instilling a fear that governs black lives. Letter from a Region in My Mind Writing for The New Yorker in 1962, James Baldwin recounts his life through navigating various faiths; in the process, he elucidates the religious underpinnings behind constructions of race in America and worldwide. The Long History of Black Officers Reforming Policing From Within Part of The Atlantic’s project “The Presence of Justice,” Taylor Hosking’s contribution documents the ongoing project of minimizing racial bias in police operations from the Reconstruction Era to today. As Hosking illustrates, not only are minority civilians consistently targeted and punished to greater extents than their White peers, but black officers continue to face racism both in the field and internally within their departments. Police Officers Tell of Strains Of Living as a “Black in Blue” Lena Williams’ 1988 report for the New York Times profiles black officers who feel a tension between their jobs and their racial identity. These officers express how this tension affects their job performance, their perception of their communities and how white officers perceive them. How to raise a black son in America In his brief TED Talk, poet Clint Smith remembers a night from his boyhood when he played with water guns in an empty parking lot with his white friends. He paints the scene of his father’s furious and fearful response. Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis In 2018, “Black infants in America [were] now more than twice as likely to die as white infants,” and “Black women [were] three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts.” Full of statistics and first-hand accounts, Linda Villarosa’s article for the New York Times claims that systemic racism causes adverse health effects in black women that can jeopardize pregnancy, and that racial bias and inequalities in health care put black mothers and black babies at risk. America’s Unfair Rules of the Road Corinne Ramey at Slate gives detailed accounts of how public transportation in many U.S. cities fails to provide quality access and service to neighborhoods of racial minorities and low income. Not only do recent transportation projects devalue and destroy minority neighborhoods, they also negatively impact the health and wellness of communities of color. Spike Lee on Gentrification When an audience member at the Pratt Institute in New York asks film director Spike Lee to consider the positive impacts of gentrification, Lee fires back with stories from his own lived experience to evidence the real harm faced by displaced black communities in Brooklyn. The Long, Painful History of Police Brutality in the U.S. Digging through the archives of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Katie Nodjimbadem finds that today’s concerns over police brutality date back to decades before the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Policing the Police: A Civil Rights Story Historian Sarah Brady Siff at the online journal Origins details how the problem of “policing the police” stretches back decades and is rooted in the structure of American politics itself. U.S. federalism has created a tension between rights guaranteed by the Constitution and police authority that resides at the state and local levels, and sorting out those tensions remains an unfinished part of the civil rights movement. Books for Further Exploration: Between the World and Me (Ta-Nehisi Coates) pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, offering a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race (edited by Jesmyn Ward) gathers some of today’s most original thinkers and writers in response to James Baldwin’s 1962 classic, The Fire Next Time. The collection is divided into three parts that shine a light on the darkest corners of our history, wrestle with our current predicament, and envision a better future. Savage Inequalities: Children in America’s Schools (Jonathan Kozal) reports on the author’s two-year tour of U.S. public schools, which revealed extreme divide in the quality of resources, facilities and staffing between the country’s richest and poorest schools, challenging the belief that our country provides all children with equal opportunities. White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son (Tim Wise) is personal examination of the way in which racial privilege shapes the daily lives of white Americans in every realm: employment, education, housing, criminal justice, and elsewhere. Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America (Michael Eric Dyson) argues that if we are to make real racial progress we must face difficult truths, including being honest about how black grievance has been ignored, dismissed, or discounted. The New Jim Crow (Michelle Alexander) is an account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status—denied the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights Movement. Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice (Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins and Ann Hazzard) follows two families – one white, one black – as they discuss a police shooting of a black man in their community. The story aims to answer children’s questions about such traumatic events, and to help children identify and counter racial injustice in their own lives. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CREATORS ‘THIS LIBRETTO WAS MY PERSONAL LETTER TO THE WORLD’ A conversation with composer Jeanine Tesori and librettist and director Tazewell Thompson about the opera Blue. Tazewell: “When Jeanine Tesori picked me as the librettist for a project about race in the US, I knew I was going to write a story that centred on the continuous, countless and unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by mostly white police officers. There isn’t a Black man in the US today who hasn’t had some sort of encounter or conflict with a police officer, whether it be minor or traumatic and violent.” Jeanine: “After several conversations with Tazewell, who also drew on his own personal experiences, we decided to create an opera that would tell the story of a Black family living in Harlem. I knew Tazewell’s portrayal would be nuanced, without compromising the complexity of the characters or the story. This is why the father’s character was depicted as a police officer – or in keeping with Tazewell’s clever pun: a ‘Black man in blue’. The father’s identity as a ‘Black man in blue’ is complicated and fraught with tension. He puts his life on the line on a daily basis, but his family – especially his activist son – don’t consider him a hero when he comes home at the end of the day. We felt that was a story worth telling.” Tazewell: \"Blue is an intimate portrayal of a Black family living in Harlem, whose world is ripped apart when they become victims of a gross injustice. The opera exposes the systemic racism that seeps into everyday American life like poison, and reminds audiences that police brutality headlines come with a lot of pain and suffering that doesn’t just end when replaced with the latest breaking news. Blue is a story that needs to be told in the opera world. It is so important for all of us to see operas that don’t necessarily reflect our own personal experiences. In this way, we may surprise ourselves by detecting relatable elements – or if there are none, we can ask ourselves what we have learned from this story.” Jeanine: Our objective is to challenge audience assumptions by going against the grain. For instance, Blue opens with a very pared-down scene, in which an African American man stands in silence before the audience. It is important to me to challenge a viewer’s expectations, but it is equally imperative that I do so in a manner that lets the audience draw their own conclusions, without being told which direction to head in. This is true of music as well: most people observing a large choir of black singers in a church, will expect to hear gospel – but this was not Tazewell's experience. I therefore decided to compose hymn-like chorales and choral music, that generally do not rely on counterpoint, but are more about singing together collectively in harmony. We did not want to depict the church as a brick building, but rather as a warm and loving community that – when united in song – has a similar effect to a hug in that it gets you through hard times.” Tazewell: \"While Blue definitely tackles some heavy and painful subjects, it also offers hope. There are some wonderfully heartening moments in this opera, such as the cheerful scene in which the mother tells her friends she is expecting a baby; or the bar scene in which the novice father shares his good news with his boisterous colleagues and friends; or the clash between the father and his rebellious son, who fight like cat and dog to defend their emotional territory, but then clasp each other in a warm and compassionate embrace; or perhaps most moving of all: the church community and friends who reach out to and support the bereaved parents in their final goodbye to their son. Even though everyone’s hopes for the son’s future have been shattered, they all pray that one day everything will be different.” - Originally published by Dutch National Opera 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

It is timeless tale from Greek antiquity about the pitfalls of ambition, vanity, and making open-ended promises. Princess Semele wants to live her best life. To her, that doesn’t mean marrying Athamas, a mere human prince. She has her eyes on a bigger prize, none other than Jove (Jupiter), King of the Gods, who she thinks will fulfill her in ways no mortal ever could. Jove is a cad, who is all too happy to add Semele to his long list of human mistresses. His wife Juno is none too pleased, and hatches a sure-fire plan for revenge. Appearing as Semele’s sister Ino, Juno tricks Semele into making a fatal request. Jove, inflamed with passion, swears to give Semele whatever she desires. Semele insists that he appear to her in all his divine glory. Realizing this would kill her, since no human can withstand the awesome power of his thunderbolts, Jove tries in vain to change her mind. Undaunted, Semele insists. Being unable to rescind his oath to grant her request, Jove reluctantly complies, and the ensuing thunderbolts consume Semele in flames. Join us for Pittsburgh Opera’s first-ever performances of Handel’s Semele, with a stylish Roaring Twenties Art Deco production conducted by Music Director Antony Walker and directed by Kristine McIntyre. Pittsburgh Opera is pleased to partner with Chatham Baroque for Semele. Founded in 1990, Chatham Baroque continues to excite local, national, and international audiences with dazzling technique and lively interpretations of 17th- and 18th-century music played on authentic period instruments.

Signs from Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, indicate she approves of the match (Chorus: Lucky omens bless our rites.) However, the bride has been inventing one excuse after the other to put off the wedding and her father and would-be bridegroom urge her to hesitate no longer (Duet: Daughter, hear! Hear and obey!) To herself, Semele reflects on her dilemma – she does not wish to marry Athamas as she is in love with Jove himself, the King of the Gods, and calls on him to assist her (Accompanied recitative: Ah me! What refuge now is left me; arioso: O Jove! In pity teach me which to choose). Ino, Semele's sister, expresses her own state of distress as she is in love with Athamas (Quartet: Why dost thou thus untimely grieve?) Jove has heard Semele's prayer and his thunderbolts interrupt the proceedings and alarm the observers (Chorus: Cease, cease your vows), which all do except for Athamas, in despair at his wedding being cancelled, and Ino, hopelessly in love with him (Aria: Turn, hopeless lover). Athamas is astonished when she tells him bluntly that she loves him (Duet: You've undone me). Cadmus interrupts their confusion and describes the extraordinary event he has just witnessed: as they fled the temple Semele was suddenly carried off by an eagle (Accompanied recitative: Wing'd with our fears). As the act ends, Semele is seen enjoying her role as Jove’s new mistress (Aria: Endless pleasure, endless love). Act 2 Scene One Iris, Goddess of the Rainbow, arrives in a beautiful pastoral landscape and is soon joined by Juno, spurned wife of Jove and Queen of the Gods. Suspicious of her husband's conduct, Juno has sent Iris to find out what she can. Iris reports that Jove has installed Semele as his mistress in a palace atop a mountain (Recitative: Iris, impatient of thy stay) The outraged Juno swears to have revenge (Accompanied recitative: Awake, Saturnia, from thy lethargy!) and then decides that she and Iris will pay a visit to the god of sleep in his cave, in order to get magical assistance for her plan to win Jove back (Aria: Hence, Iris, hence away). Scene Two An apartment in the palace of Semele. Semele awakes and regrets that the dream she was having of being with her lover has ended (Aria: O sleep, why dost thou leave me?). When Jove enters, in the form of a young man, she tells him how difficult it is for her when he is absent. He explains that she is a mortal, unlike him, and needs to rest from their love-making from time to time. He attempts to assure her of his fidelity (Aria: Lay your doubts and fears aside). Semele, however, is beginning to be unhappy that her lover is a god and she a mere mortal. This sign of an ambition to immortality in Semele worries Jove who decides he must distract her from such thoughts (Aria: I must with speed amuse her). Jove has arranged for Semele's sister Ino to be magically transported to the palace, to keep her company, and promises that the gardens and environs will be paradise (Aria: Where'er you walk). He leaves, and Ino appears, describing the wondrous experience of being flown there by winged zephyrs (Aria: But hark! The heav’nly sphere turns round). The sisters sing of the joy they are experiencing, hearing the music of the spheres (Duet: Prepare then, ye immortal choir) and a celestial choir declares that this part of the earth has become a heaven (Chorus: Bless the glad earth). Act 3 Scene One The Cave of Sleep. Somnus, the God of Sleep, lying on his bed. Juno and Iris arrive and wake Somnus (Accompanied recitative: Somnus, awake), to his displeasure (Aria: Leave me, loathsome light). He only gets out of bed when he hears Juno mention the beautiful nymph Pasithea (Aria: More sweet is that name). Juno promises he will have the nymph if he will lend her his magical aid. She tells him to put to sleep the dragons that guard the palace where Semele is ensconced as her husband's mistress, and transform Juno herself into the likeness of Semele's sister Ino. Somnus agrees (Duet: Obey my will). Scene Two Semele's Apartment. Juno, now in the form of Ino, enters and feigns astonishment at Semele's increased beauty. She exclaims that Semele must have become a goddess herself and gives her a mirror (Recitative: Behold in this mirror). Semele is enraptured by her own beauty (Aria: Myself I shall adore). \"Ino\" advises Semele to insist that Jove appear to her in his real, godlike form, and that will make her immortal herself (Accompanied recitative: Conjure him by his oath). \"Ino\" leaves and Jove enters, eager to enjoy Semele (Aria: Come to my arms, my lovely fair) but she puts him off (Aria: I ever am granting). He swears to give her whatever she desires (Accompanied recitative: By that tremendous flood, I swear) and she makes him promise to appear to her in his godlike form (Accompanied recitative: Then cast off this human shape). He is alarmed and says that would harm her (Aria: Ah, take heed what you press), but she insists he keep his oath (Aria: No, no, I'll take no less) and leaves. Jove knows this will mean her destruction and mourns her impending doom (Accompanied recitative: Ah, whither is she gone!). Juno triumphs in the success of her scheme (Aria: Above measure is the pleasure). Scene Three Semele, granted her wish to see Jove in his true godlike form, is consumed by his thunderbolts, and as she dies she regrets her own foolishness and ambition (Accompanied recitative: Ah me! Too late I now repent). Watching this, her family express their amazement (Chorus: Oh, terror and astonishment!). Ino then reveals that she has been told by the gods that she should marry her beloved Athamus, who readily agrees to this proposition. All celebrate the fortunate outcome (Chorus: Happy, happy shall we be) PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Mt. Lebanon Magazine - Down in Front!

Harr was in rehearsals for his final production with the Maryland Opera Studio as the Badger/Priest/Harašta (The Cunning Little Vixen), when his season was uprooted by the Covid-19 epidemic and the production was cancelled. Additionally, Harr was scheduled to return to Wolf Trap Opera in Summer 2020 to perform Benoit/Alcindoro (La Boheme) and cover Gremin (Eugene Onegin), but the company was forced to cancel their productions. Wolf Trap Opera was able to invite their scheduled artists to a modified 2020 summer season, however, where Harr performed Benoit/Alcindoro in their concert, Love: Surrender, as well as several scenes in the Studio Spotlight concert. Both concerts were broadcast online. Harr’s 2018/19 season included performances as Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Angel 2 (The Road of Promise), Jimmy (Mahagonny Songspiel), and covering Frank Maurrant (Street Scene), with the Maryland Opera Studio. Additionally, Harr performed in the world premiere of Elisabeth Mehl Greene’s Hajar, also with the Maryland Opera Studio. In Summer 2019, Harr made his debuts with the Washington Opera Society as Ramfis (Aida), and with Wolf Trap Opera as a Studio Artist, performing Lackey (Ariadne auf Naxos) and Officer (Il barbiere di Siviglia), as well covering Death (Der Kaiser von Atlantis) and Basilio (Il barbiere di Siviglia). A graduate of Oberlin Conservatory, Harr performed extensively with the Oberlin Opera Theater, including Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Pandolfe (Cendrillon), Collatinus (The Rape of Lucretia), and Mamma Agathe in Donizetti’s Viva la mamma. Harr has also appeared with Opera Saratoga covering Mr. Kofner and Assan (The Consul), and the House Quartet Bass in the American premiere of Gareth Williams’s Rocking Horse Winner, Miami Classical Music Festival as Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro) and Superintendent Budd (Albert Herring), and Oberlin in Italy as Dulcamara (L’elisir d’amore) and Simone (Gianni Schicchi). For the 2019/20 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, Harr was named a winner in the Capitol District and 3rd place in the Middle-Atlantic Region. Harr completed his undergraduate studies at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and his graduate studies with the Maryland Opera Studio at the University of Maryland. He is a student of internationally renowned bass-baritone Kevin Short. Mr. Harr's Residency is generously sponsored by Robert J. and Sharon E.

Mozart, libretto Lorenzo DaPonte • Oct. 17, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 2020 Guglielmo and Ferrando, two dashing, handsome young soldiers, boast of their fiancées’ devotion and unshakable faithfulness. Their friend Don Alfonso, who’s been around the block, is skeptical. He believes all women have fickle, wandering eyes, and bets his friends that as long as they follow his instructions he can prove it. Thus begins Mozart and Da Ponte’s cunning collaboration Così fan tutte. Blissfully unaware of this scheme, the two ladies – Fiordiligi and Dorabella – chat about love with Despina. Despina, prodded by Don Alfonso, encourages the ladies to play the field. Guglielmo and Ferrando inform the ladies that they’re being sent off to war. After their alleged departure, Don Alfonso has them impersonate two love-starved strangers who woo each other’s fiancée with all their might. Will Fiordiligi and Dorabella remain faithful? Or will they succumb to the strangers’ charms? To what comic lengths will Don Alfonso go to win a bet? Will anyone live happily ever after? Così fan tutte is a delightful romantic comedy, full of surprises and Mozart’s magical melodies. We invite you to join us for this brand new production of a classic Mozart favorite, conducted by Music Director Antony Walker and directed by Crystal Manich. Sung in Italian with English supertitles. Learn more about our COVID-19 Safety Protocols!

Their older friend, the cynical Don Alfonso, declares that a woman’s constancy is like the phoenix—everyone talks about it but no one has ever seen it. He proposes a wager: if they’ll give him one day and do everything he asks, he will prove to them that the sisters are unfaithful, like all other women. Amused, the young men agree.Fiordiligi and Dorabella think of their lovers, imagining that they will soon be married. Alfonso’s plot begins when he arrives with terrible news: the young officers have been called away to their regiment. Ferrando and Guglielmo appear, apparently heartbroken, and the four make tearful farewells.The sisters’ maid Despina complains about how much work she has to do around the house. Dorabella vents her despair at her lover’s absence. Despina refuses to take her seriously: they should simply find new lovers, since men are unworthy of a woman’s fidelity. Fiordiligi and Dorabella are shocked. Alfonso bribes Despina to assist him, without revealing his plot. Ferrando and Guglielmo enter in disguise as foreigners, and declare their admiration for the ladies, each addressing the other’s girlfriend. The sisters reject their advances, Fiordiligi comparing her constancy to a rock in a storm. The men are confident of winning the bet. Ferrando expresses his love for Dorabella, and the two friends leave.As the sisters continue to lament the absence of their lovers, the “foreigners” return, pretending to have poisoned themselves in despair over their rejection. Despina and Alfonso go off to fetch help, leaving the two girls to care for the strangers. Despina reappears, disguised as a doctor, and pretends to treat the patients. When Ferrando and Guglielmo request kisses in order to fully recover, the sisters again reject them, but it is clear they’re beginning to show interest in the strangers.Act IIDespina lectures her mistresses on how to handle men and the sisters agree that there can be no harm in a little flirtation. They decide on their partners, each picking the other’s suitor. Guglielmo, flirting with Dorabella, succeeds, but Ferrando has less luck with Fiordiligi. When he leaves, though, she struggles with her emotions.Ferrando is certain that they have won the wager. Guglielmo is happy to hear that Fiordiligi has been faithful to him, but when he shows his friend the portrait that Dorabella gave him, Ferrando is furious. Guglielmo, adopting Alfonso’s philosophy, blames it on the women. He asks Alfonso to pay him his half of the winnings, but Alfonso reminds him that the day is not yet over.Fiordiligi reproaches her sister for her behavior, but Dorabella replies that love is a thief who rewards those who obey him. Alone, Fiordiligi decides to join Guglielmo at the front, when suddenly Ferrando appears. He tries one last time to seduce her and succeeds.Guglielmo is furious, but Alfonso again declares that this is the way women are. A man who has been deceived can blame only himself.The sisters have agreed to marry the “foreigners.” Everything is ready and Alfonso arrives with the notary—Despina in another disguise. As Fiordiligi and Dorabella sign the contract, military music announces the return of their former lovers. In panic, they hide their intended husbands, who return as their real selves, first pretending surprise at their reception, then, when they discover the marriage contract, blaming the girls and threatening revenge. Finally, the men reveal their disguised identities and Fiordiligi and Dorabella ask forgiveness. Alfonso bids the lovers learn their lesson.- Courtesy of Opera News, unabridged PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Cultural District Taking Financial Hit Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera to keep live performances — but in a smaller venue Trib Live - Pittsburgh Opera productions to have small, live audiences Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera Goes Live and In Person with ‘Così fan tutte’ NEXT pittsburgh - 12 Pittsburgh events not to miss in October Opera Wire - Pittsburgh Opera to Present Socially Distanced ‘Così fan tutte’ Trib Live - Pittsburgh Opera to host live, in-person audiences for ‘Cosi fan tutte’ Pittsburgh In The Round - Mozart 2020 Style – Pittsburgh Opera to Present “Così fan tutte” to Small, Protected Audiences Broadway World - Photo Flash: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Live Indoor Performances of COSI FAN TUTTE WQED: Voice of the Arts podcast for Così fan tutte ​Therese Carmack - Dorabella Angel Romero - Ferrando Crystal Manich - Stage Director Antony Walker - Music Director Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Pittsburgh Opera offers live 'Cosi Fan Tutte' — with masks OperaGene: PITTSBURGH OPERA’S COSÌ FAN TUTTE: OPERA IN THE TIME OF COVID-19 Seen & Heard International: Beating the odds – Pittsburgh Opera’s delightful, pandemic-wise Così fan tutte Pittsburgh In The Round: Mozart’s “Così fan tutte” a Season Opener for Pittsburgh Opera – and the History Kindles VIDEO EXCERPTS “If my feelings should ever change” “May the winds be gentle” “In men you expect to find fidelity?” “My heart will remain constant” “The Locket Duet” “My thankless heart” “Your constant deceit” “You’ve won me over” 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

Little • December 11, 2020 *Due to COVID-19 concerns, Soldier Songs was presented as a livestream only. We did not host in-person performances. We would have loved to have patrons in our theater again to see this opera in-person, but we recognized social gatherings were not practical given the significant spike in COVID-19 cases in the area. We welcomed all to join us on Friday, December 11th, 2020 for a free livestreamed performance of Soldier Songs, broadcast on our Facebook and YouTube channels.* Soldier Songs combines elements of theater, opera, rock-infused-concert music, and animation to explore the perceptions versus the realities of the Soldier, the loss and exploitation of innocence, and the difficulty of expressing the truth of war. The libretto by composer David T. Little was adapted from recorded interviews with veterans of five wars. Soldier Songs traces the shift in perception of war from the age of 6 to the age of 66. We follow the abstract character through the three phases of life: Youth (playing war games), Warrior (time served in the military), and Elder (aged, wise, reflective). Each of the eleven songs in the production explores a different aspect of the soldier’s experience, ranging from rage, to fear, to joy, to grief. Multi-media is employed as a critique of the media’s ability to both glamorize and falsify the truth of combat. Soldier Songs asks tough questions and tells tough stories through its poignant libretto, driving and devastating music, and surprising visual counterpoint. The tension between the visual and aural experience works to dispel any potential numbness felt by those lucky enough to only experience war through the comfort of their living rooms. Originally commissioned by the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, which premiered the work in 2006, Soldier Songs received its workshop premiere in New York on 2008 by Beth Morrison Projects, and directed by Yuval Sharon. The full world premiere production took place in 2011 at the International Festival of Arts & Ideas in New Haven, CT. Pittsburgh Opera’s performances are by arrangement with Hendon Music, Inc., a Boosey & Hawkes company, publisher and copyright owner. Learn more about our COVID-19 Safety Protocols!

Based on interviews with veterans, and the culmination of 9 years of work by composer David T. Little, Soldier Songs is constructed in three sections: Child, Warrior, and Elder, yet the movements flow seamlessly from start to finish.CHILDA boy first encounters war through toys and games, playing with action figures available with an arsenal of accessories. As he grows, video games replace these dolls. These games offer an immersive, combat-like experience in which the player kills countless \"enemies,\" and where the only consequence of the player’s death is a brief wait while the game reloads. As the boy becomes a young adult, the game becomes more real. He registers for the draft at age eighteen. Reflecting on the highly randomized selective service process from the Vietnam War, he counts each day with a passing dread at the thought of combat. Once deployed, he counts the days again, but differently: down from 365, hoping he makes it to one.WARRIORThe boy is now a modern-day soldier. As technology has changed the tools and language of war, it has also changed the experience of combat. The soldier creates his own soundtrack: piping heavy metal into ear buds, he recreates the feeling of the video game, shooting abstract enemies that appear as pixels on a screen. But the game becomes too real, and the brutality of war sets in. Images of death, destruction and killing that may have been exciting in action movies back home, now play out with horror before his eyes. He seeks refuge from incoming ordinance; an unbearable experience that he knows will stay with him for the rest of his life.ELDERThe stories diverge. Veterans reflect on their experiences in combat, or discuss the challenges of reintegration into civilian life. One man reflects on the futility of an endless war. Another confronts the bereavement team sent to notify him of his son’s death in combat. The opera concludes with recorded interviews—the composer’s family and friends: the soldiers who inspired this work—as our soldier opens his mouth to tell his story.—David T.

Wimberly • Apr. 10, 13, 16, 18, 20, 22, 2021 While the body of the legendary tormented saxophonist Charlie “Yardbird” Parker lies unidentified in a New York City morgue, his ghost travels back to Birdland, the famed New York City jazz club named after him. As he struggles to complete his final masterpiece, the great bebop innovator revisits the demons, inspirations, and women who have both fueled and hindered his creative genius. With the aid of his strong mother Addie, three of his four wives, and his partner in the bebop jazz revolution, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie will struggle to calm his demons and write his new masterpiece before his body is identified in the morgue and this gig is up forever. Can he do it, or will the demons of his past rear their ugly heads? Join us on a freeform expedition into the mind, heart, and personal purgatory of the man they called Yardbird.

Braille Programs available Large-Print Programs available SYNOPSIS As the opera begins, Charlie Parker's spirit finds itself at Birdland, the jazz club named after him. He has just died; his body is still at the segregated hotel suite of Nica de Koenigswarter. Panicking about the scandal that will ensue when his body is found in her rooms, Nica finds his spirit at Birdland. She wants Chan, Charlie's wife, to identify his body; but Charlie begs Nica not to tell Chan where he is, to keep his secret for a while, until he has time to compose a masterpiece. Looking for inspiration, Charlie remembers growing up in Kansas City. His neighbors complain about all the noise he makes, learning to play saxophone—particularly the tritone, \"the Devil's interval\"—while his mother, Addie, worries about his lifestyle in the age of Jim Crow laws. Rebecca, Charlie's first wife, joins Addie in a lament about the challenges of being a wife and mother to black males in the United States. Hoping to save his life, Addie tells Charlie he must leave Kansas City. He promises to make her proud one day, and asks her to take care of his wife and son. Charlie's third wife, Doris, tries to help him find peace; but there are still unanswered questions. Dizzy Gillespie, on the other hand, brings Charlie inspiration, and together the two musicians triumph as Bebop is born. Charlie then remembers how he met Chan and went off to conquer California with Dizzy, despite his heroin addiction. Meanwhile, Addie remembers her pride upon hearing Charlie play on the radio. In California, Charlie hears from Chan that their two-year old daughter, Pree, is dead. Charlie breaks down and ends up in Camarillo State Hospital. Music facilitates his recovery. By now Charlie's body has been discovered. Addie wants him buried in Kansas City, but Chan wants to bury him in New York. Doris and Rebecca join the argument over where Charlie is to be buried while the world sings, \"Bird lives!\" Charlie realizes that playing the saxophone was his life's work, his masterpiece. He makes peace with himself, frees his soul, and sings lines from Paul Laurence Dunbar's classic poem, \"Sympathy.\" Adapted from Opera Philadelphia and Wikipedia PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World - Pittsburgh Opera To Perform Charlie Parker's YARDBIRD For Live, Socially-Distant Audiences, April 10-22 Opera Wire - Pittsburgh Opera to Present ‘Charlie Parker’s Yardbird’ Trib Live - Things to do in Western PA - March, 2021 Observer Reporter - Pittsburgh Opera to present first-ever Pittsburgh performances of \"Charlie Parker's Yardbird\" Broadway World - Photos: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Charlie Parker's YARDBIRD Latrobe Bulletin - Events of Area Interest Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Preview: Charlie Parker focus of Pittsburgh Opera's latest live production WQED-FM - Voice of the Arts podcast interviews Stage Director Tomè Cousin Maestro Antony Walker Martin Bakari (Charlie Parker) Jasmine Muhammad Trib Live - Things to do in Western PA - April, 2021 Pittsburgh Magazine - Top Pick: From home or the Strip, hear “Charlie Parker’s Yardbird” from Pittsburgh Opera Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Charlie Parker’s Yardbird’ Examines the Talented and Troubled Musician’s Life KDKA-TV CBS Pittsburgh- Pittsburgh Today Live - PTL Weekend Guide Broadway World - Photos: First Look at YARDBIRD from Pittsburgh Opera Opera Wire - Top 10 Operas to Stream This Week Trib Live - Pittsburgh Opera offers free livestream of 'Charlie Parker's Yardbird' Downbeat - What to Stream, April 12–19 Pittsburgh City Paper - Seven Days in Pittsburgh: April 15-21 - This week’s must-see arts and cultural events NEXTpittsburgh - What to do this weekend, from the Carrie Carpool Cinema to Pittsburgh Opera’s Yardbird Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Review: ‘Charlie Parker’s Yardbird’ soars at Pittsburgh Opera Pittsburgh In The Round Review - “Charlie Parker’s Yardbird” Flies on the Wings of Song at Pittsburgh Opera Seen & Heard International - Review: Pittsburgh Opera again beats the odds with live performances of Charlie Parker’s Yardbird AUDIO PREVIEW EXCERPTS Listen to Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn give a brief synopsis of Charlie Parker's Yardbird featuring excerpts from Opera Philadelphia's 2016 Apollo Theater New York premiere recording.

He is hunkered down in a rural Toby jug museum in a rust belt Ohio town where Tink Enraught, a mannered curatrix, offers him tea and cookies. Milcom is a “Thirteenther” – a conspiracy theorist who believes an obscure, would-be Thirteenth amendment negates the authority of our government. He occupies the museum because it is the only place left in his failed town to receive federal funds – a grant for the upkeep of a rare 17th-century British pitcher known as “Sir Oswyn.” Although Milcom expects to be swarmed by military drones, attention is paid only by Agent Reyes, a young rookie FBI field specialist. Milcom explains that the town’s only major source of employment – a hammer manufacturer – has gone under, leaving the residents lost. He is armed with “the Last American Hammer” to roll off the plant’s line and intends to hold a proxy trial against the US government using Toby jugs as physical stand-ins for a court. With a bluegrass-infused score that brings American roots to the operatic stage, The Last American Hammer combines comedy with empathy in small town USA. The Last American Hammer will star current and former Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artists, and be performed in the intimate environs of Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters, 2425 Liberty Avenue. Limited capacity. Milcom Negley (Timothy Mix) expresses his frustrations and disillusionment over the closing of the hammer factory where he worked loyally for years, and vents about his current situation. The Last American Hammer was commissioned by UrbanArias with very generous support from Dan and Gloria Logan; and an anonymous admirer of UrbanArias in memory of Deborah Brewer. Pittsburgh Opera’s production is sponsored by the Alice M. Ditson Fund of Columbia University. Toby Jug Museum curator Tink Enraught (Caitlin Gotimer). All photos by David Bachman.

Act One opens on Milcom Negley, a conspiracy theorist, militia man and unemployed hammersmith. He has occupied The National Toby Jug Museum, a cozy gallery full of Toby Jugs, which are antique ceramic pitchers shaped like people. At Milcom’s request, the museum’s curator Tink Enraught has called the sheriff, who has alerted the Joint Terrorism Task Force. While the two wait for the authorities to arrive, they lament the hard times their town has fallen on. When law enforcement finally arrives, Milcom is dismayed to discover that his demands have not been taken seriously. Instead of SWAT teams with armored vehicles and helicopters, they’ve sent young rookie FBI Agent Dee Dee Reyes. Her partner has holed up in a local diner eating sauerkraut balls, leaving her to deal with this ‘unarmed, non-hostage situation’ by herself. Agent Reyes is also dismayed, realizing that what she thought could be her ‘big chance’ for an important assignment is essentially rookie hazing. Tink invites Agent Reyes to join her for tea and cookies as Milcom launches into his conspiracy theory on the Thirteenth Amendment, a would-be amendment that negates the authority of the federal government. In Milcom’s impassioned ranting, he expresses outrage over the fact that the little Toby Jug Museum is the only place left in his dilapidated and failed town to receive federal funding. The Museum receives a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for the upkeep of a rare 17-century British jug known as “Sir Oswyn,” which is the crown jewel in the Museum’s collection and the only jug of its kind still in existence. Milcom calls this an “insulting waste of taxman’s plunder” and a “federally funded heap of prissy elitist crap.” Deeply offended, Tink launches into a touching soliloquy where she defends her quaint museum and praises the intrinsic value of “delicate things.” Annoyed that Milcom and Tink are wasting her time, Agent Reyes starts to leave. Stopping her, Milcom reveals the content of the case he has been carrying – a steel hammer with a curved hickory handle. This is the last American hammer made at the now-closed factory where Milcom used to work, “a product of freedom and muscle and sweat…by an underpaid, and overlooked, and doomed American man.” Milcom then launches into a tirade against Agent Reyes, berating her for enforcing the rules of The Man, citing a long list of perceived governmental outrages against its citizens. In reply, Agent Reyes explains that she tries not to make assumptions about people and situations before having all the facts, and she wishes that Milcom would give her the same courtesy. Agent Reyes asks Tink how she managed to get wrapped up in all of this. Tink reveals that she was a political revolutionary in her younger years. She wants Milcom to share his grievances with authorities because she can empathize with his passion, even if she thinks he’s misguided. Meanwhile, Milcom has arranged a number of Toby Jugs in a mock courtroom scene. He intends to put the corrupt, dishonest US government on trial, and is using the jugs as jurors and court officers. He himself is the prosecutor. The precious Sir Oswyn jug is the defendant. Tink grows increasingly concerned for the jugs’ safety. Milcom makes Tink and Agent Reyes take the stand and answer his questions. Milcom presents an enraged closing argument for the prosecution, accusing America of abandoning its people and closing factories like his down, while spending money to fund trinkets like the Toby Jugs. Milcom then has Agent Reyes make a closing statement on behalf of the government, but it does nothing to change his mind. He announces that the jury has found the defendant guilty on charges of tyranny, illegitimate power and corruption of values. The sentence is destruction… “by thirty-two ounces of Bethlehem steel.” Milcom destroys the Sir Oswyn jug with his hammer, as Tink and Reyes watch in horror. Milcom drops the hammer. Tink removes the other jugs from the table. Agent Reyes places the hammer back in its case and announces the sheriff will be coming. She thanks Tink for the tea, takes one last cookie, and exits. Tink sadly sweeps up the shattered remains of the prized jug, while Milcom watches with guilt. - Courtesy of Pittsburgh Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS City Paper: Winter Guide: Stage Pittsburgh Magazine: Best of Culture This Month in Pittsburgh Broadway World: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Pittsburgh Debut Of THE LAST AMERICAN HAMMER Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: February Theater Guide Trib Live: Entertainment Planner Feb. 13-26 OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera to Present ‘The Last American Hammer’ Broadway World: Photo Flash - Pittsburgh Opera presents The Last American Hammer NEXT Pittsburgh: 16 things to do this weekend in Pittsburgh Trib-Live: Preview: ‘The Last American Hammer’ examines grand passions in small space Pittsburgh in the Round: Conductor Glenn Lewis on Pittsburgh Opera’s “The Last American Hammer” WQED-FM: Voice of the Arts podcast interviews Peter Hilliard & Matt Boresi - composer and librettist Glenn Lewis, conductor Timothy Mix (Milcom Negley) Caitlin Gotimer (Tink Enraught) Matthew Haney, Stage Director Ellwood City Ledger: Fun things to do: Lego land and a unique opera 90.5 WESA-FM Pittsburgh's NPR News Station: \"Hammer\" Time: Satiric Opera Explores Mistrust Of Government -- And Our Mistrust Of Each Other Broadway World: Photo Flash: Take a Look Inside Dress Rehearsal for THE LAST AMERICAN HAMMER at Pittsburgh Opera Natural Awakenings Magazine: The Last American Hammer Sensi Magazine: Pittsburgh Opera’s debut of The Last American Hammer will change your mind about opera Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review - An opera brings the hammer down Pittsburgh in the Round: Review - The Last American Hammer Moundsville: Review - New Political Opera ‘The Last American Hammer’ Nails Working-Class America’s Pain City Paper: Review - Satirical opera The Last American Hammer delivers absurdity, poignancy, Toby Jugs The Downtowner: Review - The Last American Hammer Is A Smash Hit The Wall Street Journal: Review - Standoff Satire AUDIO PREVIEW EXCERPTS Listen to Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn give a brief synopsis of The Last American Hammer featuring excerpts from the Urban Arias' premiere conducted by Robert Wood.

The title character, Alcina, is a malicious sorceress who lives on an enchanted island with her sister Morgana. Alcina uses her magic spells to trick men into falling in love with her. But once she tires of them, she turns them into animals or inanimate objects. Alcina’s current crush is Ruggiero, a chivalrous knight she has captured. Ruggiero’s fiancé Bradamante and her tutor Melisso arrive to bring Ruggiero home. But Alcina and Morgana have no intention of letting him leave, setting the stage for a climactic showdown. Will Ruggiero regain his senses in time? Will Alcina’s evil spell finally be broken? All performances will be in the cozy confines of Pittsburgh CAPA Theater, 111 9th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, which is ideally suited for Baroque performances. Pittsburgh Opera is pleased to partner with Chatham Baroque for Alcina. Founded in 1990, Chatham Baroque continues to excite local, national, and international audiences with dazzling technique and lively interpretations of 17th- and 18th-century music played on authentic period instruments.

They meet Morgana, Alcina's sister, who falls in love with the disguised Bradamante and promises to take them to the Queen. Alcina is revealed, surrounded by her court, including Ruggiero. Bradamante confronts Ruggiero, who recognizes her as Ricciardo but denies any interest in Ricciardo's sister—he is the faithful lover of Alcina. He runs off to find her. Oronte, rightly suspecting the constancy of Morgana, whom he loves, charges Bradamante with having stolen Morgana's love. Morgana defends Bradamante and insults Oronte. Bradamante tries to calm their mutual recriminations. Oronte, coming upon Ruggiero, who is sighing for the absent Alcina, decides to alleviate his own jealousy by making Ruggiero jealous too, and concocts a tale that Alcina now loves \"Ricciardo\" and will no doubt soon add Ruggiero to her collection of discarded and transformed lovers. Ruggiero believes him and heaps reproaches on the puzzled Alcina, who assures him that her feelings are unchanged. Bradamante accuses Ruggiero of disloyalty, but he retaliates with defiance, accusing her, as Ricciardo, of having stolen Alcina's love. Bradamante discloses her identity, but Melisso, worried that Ruggiero is not yet ready for this information, convinces him that she is not really Bradamante. Morgana warns Bradamante that Ruggiero has persuaded Alcina to change her into a wild beast, so Bradamante tells Morgana to assure Ruggiero that she does not love Alcina, but rather Morgana herself... Melisso, disguised as Ruggiero's tutor Atlante, reproaches him with having abandoned the path of glory and gives him a magic ring that brings him to his senses. Ruggiero regrets his faithlessness to Bradamante and wishes to send a message of defiance to Alcina, but Melisso advises him to pretend that he still loves her and make his escape on the pretext of going hunting. Bradamante again reveals her identity, only to have Ruggiero reject this revelation as another of Alcina's deceptions. Alcina is preparing to change Ricciardo into a wild beast to appease Ruggiero, while Morgana tries to dissuade her and Ruggiero assures her that he is no longer jealous, so drastic measures are no longer necessary. Alcina notices that Ruggiero is not in his usual spirits and he suggests a hunt as a restorative. She consents and he departs. Oronte brings the news that Ruggiero is planning to flee. The heartbroken Alcina prepares to foil this plan. Intermission Part TwoOronte tells Morgana that her new love is about to leave her, but she refuses to believe this and departs scornfully, leaving him to lament her power over him. Ruggiero is at last convinced that Bradamante is really herself. Morgana discovers them embracing, reproaches her for being a faithless guest and Ruggiero with betraying Alcina. Ruggiero looks forward to the ending of the enchantments. Alcina begins to make spells to bind Ruggiero to her, but realizes her powers have deserted her. Morgana tries to ingratiate herself with Oronte, who pretends indifference, but has to admit to himself that he still loves her. Alcina upbraids Ruggiero for trying to leave her. He tells her that his betrothed Bradamante now has his love. Alcina threatens vengeance, though unable to obliterate her tender feelings for him. Bradamante and Melisso join Ruggiero to plan their campaign. Melisso tells them that the island is surrounded by Alcina's enchanted monsters. Although worried at leaving his beloved, Ruggiero sets off, followed by Melisso and Bradamante, who vows to free those lying under enchantment. Oronte announces to Alcina the complete defeat of her forces and she laments her cruel fate.Ruggiero and Bradamante confront Alcina, each advising the other not to be taken in by her deceptions. She tries both pleading and threats in vain. Ruggiero smashes the orb which holds Alcina's secret power. All her spells are broken, and all are transformed. Ruggiero, Bradamante and Melisso leave the broken hearted Alcina alone with her grief.

She also hopes to find her long-lost lover Cristóbal, a butterfly hunter, who has disappeared into the Amazon jungle. Florencia journeys down the Amazon river by steamship with a cast of colorful characters including an intrepid female journalist and a couple looking to rekindle their love. As they penetrate deeper and deeper into the heart of the Amazon, the passengers and crew realize their voyage is not just a physical journey, but also a mystical one. Inspired by the magic realism of Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel García Márquez and his novels Love in the Time of Cholera and One Hundred Years of Solitude, Florencia en el Amazonas features lush, melodic music and ever-changing backdrops of mysterious beauty. Music Director Antony Walker conducts; Stephanie Havey directs a revival of Jose Maria Condemi's original production. These performances have received special funding from The Pittsburgh Foundation.

The El Dorado, a steamboat sailing down the Amazon from Leticia, Colombia, to Manaus in the early 1900s. On the riverbank, Riolobo, a mystical character who can assume many forms, excitedly announces that the El Dorado is bound for the opera house in Manaus. There, the legendary opera diva Florencia Grimaldi, who has not set foot in her native South America for twenty years, will give a concert to reopen the theater. From among the crowds lining the riverbank and selling their local wares, we glimpse the ship’s passengers coming aboard: a young journalist, Rosalba, who is working on a biography of Florencia Grimaldi; Paula and Alvaro, a middle-aged couple journeying to hear Grimaldi in hopes of rekindling their marriage; and the diva herself, traveling incognito. As the ship pulls away from the busy port, Florencia reflects on the emptiness of her life and her desire to rediscover herself and her long-lost lover, Cristóbal, a butterfly hunter in search of the rare Emerald Muse. Rosalba’s notebook is rescued from the river by the ship Capitán’s nephew, Arcadio, and they exchange confidences about their longings and desires. Alvaro and Paula attempt to dine on deck, but misunderstandings about the exotic menu lead only to bitter exchanges. Florencia, awakened by the sounds of the jungle, learns from the Capitán that the butterfly hunter has disappeared into the jungle without a trace. Later, a tempestuous game of cards contrasts the growing affection between Rosalba and Arcadio and the escalating tension between Paula and Alvaro. A violent storm quickly develops, and the ship is carried helplessly in the rushing currents in a downpour of pink rain. Alvaro saves the boat from being crushed by tree trunks but is knocked overboard. With the Capitán unconscious, Riolobo appears in the guise of a river-spirit and implores the mercy of the gods of the river. Arcadio ably takes the helm but is unable to stop the forces of nature as the ship runs aground. ACT II. In the quiet after the storm, Florencia wonders whether she is alive or dead. Arcadio and Rosalba rejoice to find they have survived the storm, but, frightened by the intensity of their feelings for each other, vow not to fall in love and risk disillusionment. Paula laments the loss of Alvaro, recognizing that the wall between them was pride—not a lack of love. Riolobo once again calls upon the mystical and transformative powers of the Amazon. Suddenly Alvaro is returned to the boat, explaining that Paula’s voice called him back from the brink of death. On behalf of all the passengers, Florencia thanks him for saving their lives, and they resume their journey to Manaus. Rosalba finds her ruined notebook, which contained all her notes for the biography of Florencia. Rosalba is distraught by the loss of two years’ work, but Florencia tells her she has lost nothing irreplaceable. The two women begin to argue about the source of Grimaldi’s talents, and when Florencia passionately declares that the diva’s gift sprang from her love for a man, Rosalba suddenly realizes the woman standing before her is the opera singer herself. With both pairs of lovers reconciled to their need for each other, the ship is about to reach Manaus when it is discovered that no one may disembark because of a cholera epidemic. In despair at being unable to fulfill her search Florencia’s spirit drifts toward Cristóbal in a mystical reunion. - Courtesy of Houston Grand Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World: Photo Flash: Get A First Look At The Company Of Pittsburgh Opera's FLORENCIA EN EL AMAZONAS Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: November Theater Guide Pittsburgh In The Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s Christopher Hahn on “Florencia en el Amazonas” Pittsburgh Current: Fall Stage and Performance Guide NEXT pittsburgh: 16 cool things to do this weekend in Pittsburgh OperaWire: Alexandra Loutsion & Nathan Gunn Lead Pittsburgh Opera Premiere Of ‘Florencia En El Amazonas’ Pittsburgh Magazine: Best of Culture in Pittsburgh in November Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: 10 things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend Trib-Live: Entertainment Planner Nov. 7-20 The Pittsburgh 100: The P100 Podcast - \"On sinkholes and sopranos\" (interview with Alexandra Loutsion ~ 16:15 into the episode) The Incline: What to do this week in Pittsburgh: Nov. 11-17, 2019 Trib-Live: Preview - Pittsburgh Opera journeys to the ‘magical realism’ of the Amazon WQED-FM: Voice of the Arts podcast interviews Alexandra Loutsion - Florencia Grimaldi Craig Verm - Riolobo Natasha Wilson - Rosalba Antony Walker - Conductor Broadway World: Photo Flash: First Look At Pittsburgh Opera's FLORENCIA EN EL AMAZONAS Pittsburgh In The Round: Review - Pittsburgh Opera’s “Florencia en el Amazonas” Premiere a Full-Steam-Ahead Success Opera Gene: Review - PITTSBURGH OPERA’S FLORENCIA EN EL AMAZONAS: YOU MUST SEE IT TWICE Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review - A diva's final aria is transcendent at Pittsburgh Opera AUDIO PREVIEW EXCERPTS Listen to Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn give a brief synopsis of Florencia en el Amazonas featuring excerpts from this 2002 Houston Grand Opera recording by Albany Records with Patrick Summers conducting the Houston Grand Opera Orchestra: Click play below or download these excerpts for an offline treat!

Serial womanizer. Sexual predator. Don Giovanni is all these and more. As the list of people out to get him grows longer, eventually his misdeeds catch up with him. Don Giovanni leaves a trail of broken hearts, and worse, wherever he goes. He has his servant, the reluctant doormat Leporello, keep a journal of Don Giovanni’s many conquests. Completely without morals or a conscience, Don Giovanni sexually assaults Donna Anna, then kills her father the Commendatore, who had tried to come to her defense. He seduces young Zerlina on her wedding day. But all actions have consequences, as Don Giovanni is soon to learn.

Suddenly Giovanni runs into the street pursued by Donna Anna, the Commendatore’s daughter, who accuses him of trying to attack her. The Commendatore rushes to his daughter’s aid and is killed by Giovanni. Anna asks her fiancé, Don Ottavio, to avenge her father’s death. At a café the next morning, Giovanni and Leporello encounter one of Giovanni’s former conquests, Donna Elvira, who is still angry at Giovanni’s betrayal. Leporello tries to discourage her from pursuing Giovanni by showing her his catalogue with the name of every woman Giovanni has seduced. Meanwhile, Masetto and Zerlina celebrate their upcoming wedding with friends. Don Giovanni asks Leporello to get rid of the groom. Alone with Zerlina, Giovanni persuades her to come away with him. Before they can leave, Elvira interrupts them and leads Zerlina away. Momentarily thwarted, Giovanni greets the mourning Anna and Ottavio, only to be embarrassed by the persistent Elvira, who denounces him as a seducer. Trying to dismiss her as a madwoman, he ushers Elvira off. Anna, in horror, recognizes him as her father’s murderer and calls on Ottavio to avenge her honor. Later that afternoon, Giovanni looks forward to an evening of partying he has arranged in Zerlina’s honor. Zerlina begs the furious Masetto to forgive her. Anna, Ottavio and Elvira arrive in disguise, swearing vengeance, and Giovanni tells Leporello to invite them in. Inside Giovanni’s nightclub, Leporello distracts Masetto while Giovanni dances with Zerlina, trying to drag her into an adjoining room. When Zerlina cries for help, Anna, Elvira, and Ottavio unmask and confront Giovanni, who escapes. Intermission Act II Under Elvira’s balcony, Leporello exchanges clothes with Giovanni to woo the lady in his master’s stead. Leporello and Elvira go off, leaving Giovanni free to serenade Elvira’s maid. When Masetto arrives with his friends to punish Giovanni, the disguised Don tricks Masetto and beats him up. Zerlina tenderly consoles him. Elvira follows the disguised Leporello into a dimly lit church. Leporello tries to escape, but is discovered by Anna, Ottavio, Zerlina and Masetto. Mistaking servant for master, they join in denouncing the supposed Don. Frightened, Leporello reveals his identity and manages to escape. Ottavio asks Zerlina and Masetto to comfort the distraught Anna and go to the authorities for help. Left alone, Elvira thinks about her love for Giovanni in spite of everything. Leporello finds Giovanni in a cemetery, where a statue of the slain Commendatore warns Giovanni of his doom. The Don forces the terrified Leporello to invite the statue to dinner only to be surprised by the Commendatore himself. Ottavio urges Anna to stop grieving and accept his love. She implores him to wait until her father is avenged. Late that night in the empty club, Giovanni orders Leporello to serve supper. Elvira arrives and attempts to persuade Giovanni to reform his ways, but he sends her away. In a final confrontation with the Commendatore, Giovanni is finally forced to pay for his crimes. -Courtesy of Kristine McIntyre PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera To Open With ‘Don Giovanni’ Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Fall Arts Preview: Classical music events to note Pittsburgh Current: Fall Stage And Performance Guide 2019 Trib Live: Pittsburgh Opera’s season lineup spans centuries Pittsburgh 100: Mozart’s ‘Don Giovanni’ opens Pittsburgh Opera’s new season Pittsburgh Current: Pittsburgh Opera Opens Season With Film Noir “Don Giovanni” Broadway World: Photo Flash - a first look at Pittsburgh Opera's Don Giovanni Trib Live: Entertainment planner: Oct. 3-16 Pgh In The Round: Director Kristine McIntyre’s “Film Noir” Take on a Mozart Classic to Open Pittsburgh Opera’s 81st Season The Urban Twist: Q&A w/ Pittsburgh Opera ‘Don Giovanni’ Director Kristine McIntyre NEXT pittsburgh: 23 cool things to do this weekend in Pittsburgh Trib Live: Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Don Giovanni’ still relevant today Opera Gene: Pittsburgh Opera's 2019-20 Season: Blockbusters and a new app starting Saturday WQED-FM: Voice of the Arts podcast interviews: Maestro Antony Walker Stage Director Kristine McIntyre Corrie Stallings (Donna Elvira) Craig Verm (Don Giovanni) Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review: In Pittsburgh Opera's 'Don Giovanni,' a noir spin proves arresting, thought-provoking Pgh In The Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s “Don Giovanni” a Dazzling Opening Night Delight Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: Sex and Violence on a Mythic Scale: ‘Don Giovanni’ at Pittsburgh Opera Broadway World: Photo Flash: Pittsburgh Opera's Don Giovanni The Duquesne Duke: Pittsburgh Opera masterfully tackles classic The Downtowner: Review: The Pittsburgh Opera Presents Don Giovanni Empty Nest Blog: Day 348- Pittsburgh Opera-Don Giovanni WESA-FM: Left To Their Own Devices: Opera Rolls Out Live Mobile App With Audio VIDEO EXCERPTS In the famous 'catalogue aria', Don Giovanni's servant/henchman Leporello (Musa Ngqungwana) tells Donna Elvira (Corrie Stallings) about the long litany of women his boss has seduced.

The inspiration for the hit Broadway musical Miss Saigon, Madama Butterfly follows the tragic love story of the innocent, naive geisha Cio-Cio San and Pinkerton, a callous US naval officer. Cio-Cio San, while still a teenager, forsakes her family, heritage, and religion for Pinkerton. But what she considers to be true love, he considers a casual fling. Cio-Cio San clings to the increasingly unrealistic belief that Pinkerton will return to her. Madama Butterfly is unparalleled in its heart-wrenching portrayal of love, betrayal, and sacrifice. Accompanied by an achingly beautiful score, this opera promises to be an unforgettable experience. Music Director Antony Walker conducts the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra and Chorus.

Nagasaki, around 1900. U.S. Navy Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton inspects the house he has leased for 999 years from a marriage broker, Goro. Included with the house are three servants including Suzuki, the maid. They are expecting the bride, Cio-Cio San, known as Madama Butterfly, whom Pinkerton has purchased for 100 yen. To the American Consul, Sharpless, Pinkerton describes the carefree philosophy of a sailor roaming the world in search of pleasure (Dovunque al mondo). For the moment, he is enchanted with the fragile Butterfly, but when Sharpless warns that Butterfly may not take her vows so lightly, Pinkerton brushes aside such scruples, saying he will one day marry a “real” American wife. Butterfly is heard in the distance joyously singing of her wedding (Ancora un passo or via). Entering surrounded by friends and family, Pinkerton’s fifteen-year-old bride tells him how she had to earn her living as a geisha when her family fell on hard times. In a quiet moment (Vieni, amor mio!), Butterfly displays her few possessions—including figures of her ancestors—and then reveals that she has converted to Christianity. The celebration is interrupted by Butterfly’s uncle, a Buddhist monk, who curses Butterfly for having renounced her ancestral religion. Pinkerton angrily sends the guests away. Alone with the distraught Butterfly, he dries her tears (Viene la sera) and they proclaim their love under the immense starry sky (Vogliateme bene, un bene piccolino). ACT II, Scene 1. Three years later, Butterfly waits for her husband’s return. As Suzuki prays (E Izaghi ed Izanami), her mistress stands with her eyes fixed on the harbor. When Suzuki shows her how little money is left, Butterfly urges her to have faith—one fine day Pinkerton’s ship will appear on the horizon (Un bel dì vedremo). Sharpless brings a letter from the lieutenant, but before he can read it to Butterfly, Goro appears with a handsome and wealthy suitor, Prince Yamadori. Brusquely dismissing both broker and prince, Butterfly insists her husband has not deserted her. Sharpless tries again to read the letter and suggests Pinkerton may not return (Ora a noi). Butterfly triumphantly carries in her child, Trouble, proclaiming that as soon as Pinkerton knows he has a son he surely will come back. If he does not, she would rather die than return to her former life. Both moved and frustrated by her blind faith, Sharpless leaves without revealing the rest of the letter. Butterfly, on the point of despair, hears a cannon shot. Now delirious with joy on seeing Pinkerton’s ship entering the harbor, she orders Suzuki to help fill the house with blossoms (Flower Duet: Una nave de guerra). Expecting Pinkerton to come running, Butterfly settles down to wait with Suzuki and little Trouble (Humming Chorus: Coro a bocca chiusa). Scene 2. When Pinkerton still has not arrived at dawn, Suzuki insists that Butterfly rest. Before long, Sharpless enters with Pinkerton and Kate, his American wife. When Suzuki realizes who the woman is, she tearfully agrees to aid in breaking the news to her mistress. Seized with remorse, Pinkerton bids an anguished farewell to the scene of his former happiness (Addio, fiorito asil) and then rushes away. When Butterfly comes in expecting to find him, she finds Kate instead. Guessing the truth, the shattered Butterfly agrees to give up her child if his father will return for him. Then, sending even Suzuki away, she takes out the dagger with which her father committed Seppuku and bows before a statue of Buddha, choosing to die with honor rather than live in disgrace. As she raises the blade, Suzuki pushes the child into the room. Sobbing farewell, Butterfly sends him into the garden to play, then stabs herself (Con onor muore). As she dies, Pinkerton is heard calling her name. -Adapted from Opera News PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Music Seasons Broadway World - Pittsburgh Opera Presents Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY Opera Wire - Pittsburgh Opera To Open 80th Season With ‘Madama Butterfly’ Trib Live - Fall arts: 6 productions on tap for Pittsburgh Opera Popular Pittsburgh - Another Opera Singer Makes Pittsburgh Her Home OperaGene - Pittsburgh Opera's 2018-19 Season: Two Seasons Actually Pittsburgh Current - Pittsburgh Opera Opens 80th Season With Puccini’s Tragedy, “Madama Butterfly” Trib Live - Entertainment planner: Sept. 27-Oct. 10 'Burgh Vivant - video interview with Laurel Semerdjian (Suzuki) Pittsburgh Magazine - October: Best of Culture in Pittsburgh Trib Live - New Kensington girl happy to be Trouble for Pittsburgh Opera The Urban Twist - Come Salute Cody Austin in ‘Madama Butterfly’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh - October Theater Guide: Foreign Intrigue Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - article on women stage directors in opera, with Linda Brovsky interview Trib Live - Pittsburgh Opera's 'Madama Butterfly' is timeless tale Pittsburgh in the Round - Laurel Semerdjian Returning to Pittsburgh Opera in “Madama Butterfly” Mt.

Idomeneo is the King of Crete. Idamante is his son. Ilia is the Princess of Troy and enemy of Crete, who Idamante rescues from a shipwreck. King Idomeneo promises to kill the “traitor” who rescued Ilia, not realizing it was his son. Meanwhile, Ilia and Idamante begin to fall in love with each other, which infuriates Elettra, the Princess of Argos, who loves Idamante as well. These four strong-willed characters are caught in a whirlwind of love, betrayal, loyalty, and family as they seek to rebuild their lives. afterWARds will star Pittsburgh Opera’s award-winning Resident Artists, allowing audiences the rare opportunity to see tomorrow’s opera stars - and hear this beautiful Mozart music - in an intimate performance space.

Idomeneo, King of Crete and commander of its depleted forces, is sailing home with the remainder of his men. Also on board is Ilia, Princess of Troy, now a refugee who watched her family murdered before her eyes. The overture begins with a massive storm that overturns Idomeneo’s ship. Idamante, son of Idomeneo, braves the storm to rescue whomever he can reach. He rescues Ilia in his boat and returns to shore. Idomeneo and his men are outraged at the apparent betrayal by the unknown boatsman. As he watches his men drown around him, Idomeneo vows, if he survives himself, to kill the unknown young man as a last service to his men. (This sequence is told throughout the overture in a combination of live action and video). Back on Crete, the opera begins with Ilia in a refugee shelter. As her family’s sole survivor, she is tortured by survivor’s guilt and feelings of betrayal. Yet much more pressingly, she is racked by her newest torment: a secret, inappropriate, and impossible love for Idamante, the young man -- and former enemy -- who just saved her life. Idomeneo lands on the shore, having survived the storm. Weary from years of war and destruction, he is tortured by the thought of having to kill yet another person. Meanwhile, Idamante, believing his father to have been killed in the storm, comes to the same shore to mourn him. Father and son meet but don’t recognize each other – though Idomeneo knows that this is the man he has sworn to kill. When he discovers their true relationship, Idomeneo runs away, horrified; Idamante is left behind, confused and pained. We next meet another inhabitant of the refugee shelter: Elettra, a survivor from an infamous family. With the war finally over, Elettra fantasizes, for the first time in her life, about a positive future – with Idamante, the object of her desire, at her side. Idamante, meanwhile, confesses his own illicit feelings to Ilia. Caught completely by surprise, she rejects him – just as Idomeneo arrives. He senses that his son might have fallen for the enemy refugee, while Elettra panics that Idamante and her imagined future are slipping from her grasp. Idomeneo refuses to speak to Idamante, and seeing no other way to avoid having to kill his own son, banishes him. Idamante is crushed, not understanding his father’s reasons. Idomeneo has organized a ship to take Idamante and Elettra back to her homeland. Elettra, relieved to hear the sounds of the water, says a happy farewell to Crete. Idomeneo, meanwhile, is tortured by the vow he made and his inability to tell his son the truth. The torment he feels is overwhelming and he contemplates killing himself. Idamante and Elettra arrive and Idomeneo sends them off. Suddenly, a giant storm whips up, leaving everyone scrambling for safety. Idomeneo, in complete emotional disarray, reads it as a sign from the gods. He screams at the heavens, demanding they take him, instead. The storm subsides and Idamante seeks out Ilia to say his final farewell to her before committing suicide. Ilia makes a tortured confession of her own feelings. Both are overwhelmed, basking in this unexpected moment of bliss. Ilia seeks out Idomeneo to try and build a bridge between father and son. In a difficult moment of personal struggle, she explains to him that she is ready to accept him as a friend and father-figure, in spite of her family’s past suffering at his hands. Idamante arrives. He has learned the true reason for his father’s coldness: his father was trying to shield him from the awful truth of promising to kill him. He is ready to accept his death at Idomeneo’s hands, serene in the knowledge that his father loves him after all. Idomeneo is overwhelmed with emotion when Ilia suddenly volunteers herself in Idamante’s place. Suddenly, Idamante’s gun goes off. Elettra, seeing her future dreams dismantled before her eyes, suffers a nervous breakdown. Idomeneo, mortally wounded and deeply moved by the love of his son, makes his most courageous decision: to break his vow and allow Idamante to live, regardless of the consequences. All four sing a chorus of love and peace, looking ahead to an uncertain future. -Courtesy of David Paul PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS BroadwayWorld: Pittsburgh Opera Presents AfterWARds Pittsburgh Magazine: January: Best of Culture in Pittsburgh Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: January Theater Guide Empty Nest blog: January Preview of Events Hoodline: Top performing and visual arts events in Pittsburgh this weekend Owl Scribe Blog: Pittsburgh Opera presents afterWARds – “Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined” The Almanac: What's Happening: Week of Jan. 20 OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera To Perform ‘AfterWARds,’ A Reconstructed ‘Idomeneo’ The Almanac: Modern-day Mozart: Pittsburgh Opera debuts 'afterWARds' Pittsburgh City Paper: Pittsburgh Opera reimagines a Mozart classic to channel stories of modern refugees Pittsburgh Current: The Chill Issue: 100 Suggestions To Keep You Busy In Pittsburgh This Winter Trib Live: Pittsburgh Opera director re-imagines Mozart's 'Idomeneo' Pittsburgh in the Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s “afterWARds” – (Mozart’s “Idomeneo” Reimagined) – to Feature New Resident Artist Terrence Chin-Loy OperaWire: Top Five Operas to see this Weekend WQED Voice of the Arts podcast interviews: David Paul, stage director Glenn Lewis, conductor Antonia Botti-Lodovico (Idamante) Terrence Chin-Loy (Idomeneo) Pittsburgh Current: The Chill Issue - 100 Suggestions to Keep You Busy in Pittsburgh This Winter The Almanac: What's Happening: Week of Jan. 27 Pittsburgh in the Round review: Pittsburgh Opera's \"afterWARds\" Opens at CAPA Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: afterWARds review Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: February Theater Guide VIDEO EXCERPTS Princess Ilia of Troy (Ashley Fabian) is anguished and conflicted.

The opera deals not only with Thompson’s suffering in the jungle of southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also the tragic aftermath that followed his liberation. Colonel Thompson endured his brutal captivity by doggedly clinging to memories of his loving wife Alyce and their children. Alyce, however, believed Jim was dead. She and her children moved to Massachusetts with another man, leading to a painful reunion after Jim’s release. Glory Denied is, above all, the story of an American family during one our nation’s most turbulent eras. In its review of Mr. Philpott’s book, The New York Times stated: Indeed it is not too much to say that Glory Denied and Colonel Thompson’s mixed feelings about it encapsulate something of the moral essence of the Vietnam War and the imperishable bitterness of its legacy. Glory Denied will star Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists, and be performed in the intimate environs of Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters. Limited capacity - order now! \"Glory Denied as a whole is in keeping with Pittsburgh Opera’s past record of presenting contemporary works by gifted and impressive Resident Artists. The company deserves praise for consistently offering opportunities to hear rarities delivered by strong, young talent, and patronage is the only reward commensurate with its efforts...the work deserves full houses for all.\" - Pittsburgh in the Round Younger Alyce (Ashley Fabian) and Younger Thompson (Terrence Chin-Loy).

Captain Thompson (Jim), America’s longest-held prisoner of war, recalls episodes of his nine-year ordeal which include escape attempts, torture, the overwhelming loneliness of five years in solitary confinement, and being forced to sign a propaganda statement. He finds the strength to survive in memories of his family, letters from his wife Alyce about their home and children, and thoughts of his elaborate plans to build his dream house. Pregnant with their fourth child and only son, Alyce receives the news that Jim’s plane has been shot down. Denied any reliable information about his status or whereabouts, she soon begins a relationship with another man (Harold), eventually moving with him to Massachusetts and telling her children that their father is dead. Alyce refuses to have Jim’s name released to the public as Missing in Action, or inscribed on a P.O.W. bracelet, a popular solidarity symbol at the time, and consults a lawyer in an effort to have her husband legally declared dead. Thompson, in captivity, finds comfort in the 23rd Psalm. Act II. A number of American P.O.W.s are released and Jim returns home, but the Pentagon honors another man, Everett Alvarez, as the longest-held prisoner. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, Jim receives a letter welcoming him back from President Richard Nixon, and suggesting that “some things about America may appear to have changed” since his departure. Alyce greets Jim’s homecoming and confesses her new relationship. She offers to go away if that is what he prefers, but Jim wants to reconcile. He notes how life has changed during his nine year captivity and soon the couple begins to fight with Jim complaining that Alyce is not the wife he left behind. Alyce asserts her independence and describes what her life has been like during his absence. Jim, considered a local hero, is asked to give a sermon at the church where he and Alyce were married, and recalls his idealized family life. But Alyce has moved on. The years pass and Jim, having suffered a stroke, lives alone, estranged from his family, struggling with all that has occurred. -From Anchorage Opera PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera To Premiere ‘Glory Denied’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: February Theater Guide Hoodline: Best Music Events in Pittsburgh This Week The Almanac: What's Happening: Week of February 17 Pittsburgh Current: The Chill Issue: 100 Suggestions To Keep You Busy In Pittsburgh This Winter The Urban Twist: Q&A: Watch, Listen, and Empathize with Ben Taylor’s Performance in ‘Glory Denied’ Pittsburgh In The Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Caitlin Gotimer on Upcoming Production of “Glory Denied” NEXTpittsburgh: Top events in Pittsburgh this weekend Trib Live: Preview - Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Glory Denied’ tells POW’s story Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Behind the Curtain, Feb. 19, 2019 - Critic's Choice Beaver County Times: 3 more entertainment ideas: Enjoy a jazzy night in Beaver, a moving opera or a flight with the birds WQED-FM Voice of the Arts podcasts interviews: Ben Taylor Caitlin Gotimer James Lesniak Matthew Haney Tom Cipullo Tom Philpott Trib Live: Entertainment planner: Feb. 21-March 6 Hoodline: The best performing and visual arts events in Pittsburgh this week 90.5 WESA-FM, Pittsburgh's NPR station: Opera Recounts Struggles Of Longest-Held POW And His Family Broadway World: Photo Flash: GLORY DENIED at Pittsburgh Opera OperaWire: Top 5 Operas To See This Weekend – North America (2/22-24) Pittsburgh in the Round: Pittsburgh Opera's Premiere of Glory Denied Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Phantom of the Opera vs. Pittsburgh Opera Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: March Theater Guide Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: Cool Picks VIDEO EXCERPTS Older Alyce (Caitlin Gotimer) begins to tell her husband (Older Thompson/Ben Taylor) about decisions she made while he was held captive as a POW in Vietnam for nine years.

When Rodolfo, a poet, and Mimi, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. La bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music.

In their Latin Quarter garret on Christmas Eve, the painter Marcello and poet Rodolfo try to keep warm by burning pages from Rodolfo's latest drama. They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina \"What a cold little hand\") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì \"Yes, they call me Mimì\"), embroidering flowers and waiting for spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla \"Oh lovely girl\"). ACT II. Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the elderly, wealthy Alcindoro. Trying to regain the painter's attention, she sings a waltz about her popularity (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns. ACT III. At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì walks by, searching for the place where the reunited Marcello and Musetta now live. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, she says. Rodolfo, who has been asleep in the tavern, is heard, and Mimì hides; Marcello thinks she has left. The poet tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). The painter and his mistress part in fury, but Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. ACT IV. Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra \"Old coat\"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? \"Have they gone?\"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name. -Courtesy of Opera News PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Opera Wire: Nicole Cabell & Sean Panikkar Headline Pittsburgh Opera’ ‘La Bohème’ Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: March Theater Guide Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: The 5 best classical concerts coming up in March Pittsburgh Magazine: March 2019 Best of Culture in Pittsburgh Empty Nest: March Preview Trib Live: Entertainment planner: March 21-April 3 The Almanac: What's Happening - week of March 24 Broadway World: Photo Flash: Pittsburgh Opera Returns To Benedum Center with Puccini's LA BOHEME Pittsburgh in the Round: Jean-Luc Tingaud on Pittsburgh Opera’s Upcoming “La bohème” PGH Events: La bohème NEXT Pittsburgh: Top Events in Pittsburgh This Weekend Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: The best things happening in Pittsburgh this weekend: March 28-31 Mt.

The story concerns old and wealthy bachelor Don Pasquale, who has been the caretaker of his nephew, Ernesto, for some time. Pasquale attempts to secure Ernesto’s future by arranging a marriage between Ernesto and a “proper” girl. However, Ernesto is in love with the young widow Norina, and refuses to marry Pasquale’s suggested bride. With the help of their friend Dr. Malatesta, Ernesto and Norina set out to trick Don Pasquale into letting them marry after all. Dr. Malatesta has Norina impersonate his sweet, innocent sister and marry Pasquale in a fake wedding.

He lives in an old mansion on Sunset Boulevard that is as devoid of color as his old black-and-white films. His ward and nephew, Ernesto, has refused an arranged marriage, proclaiming his love for Norina, a popular Hollywood starlet. Don Pasquale, outraged, decides to disinherit the boy and beget his own heirs. To do this he needs a wife, and he has called on a family friend, Dr. Malatesta, to help him find one. Malatesta, siding with Ernesto and Norina, makes a plan to teach the headstrong Pasquale a lesson. Heglowingly describes to him his beautiful and completely imaginary sister and tells him that the girl is in love with him. Before long, the old bachelor is convinced he loves the girl and expresses his desire to marry her with Technicolor enthusiasm. Furthermore, he is prepared to cut Ernesto out of his will. Unaware that Dr. Malatesta has a plot afoot; Ernesto grows bitter at the apparent betrayal by his good friend, Malatesta. Act I, Scene 2: A Hollywood SoundstageShooting a scene from her next Hollywood movie, Norina’s screen persona boasts about knowing all the tricks to win a man's love. Malatesta arrives and reveals to Norina his plans for fooling Don Pasquale: Norina is to enact the role of Malatesta's sister, wed the old bachelor in a fake ceremony and then drive him so crazy with her whims and demands that he will be eager to find a way out of the unpleasant staged marriage. Malatesta hires local stage hands to help out, but there is no time to tell Ernesto. Act II: Don Pasquale's mansionRealizing that he will never be able to marry Norina without his inheritance, Ernesto laments his situation as passionately as any of his uncle’s Silent Films. When he leaves, Malatesta arrives with Don Pasquale's \"bride\" and introduces her to Pasquale, who is outlandishly dressed in an old costume worthy of Rudolph Valentino. Without further delay, a ceremony takes place, during which Ernesto returns and is forced to witness the contract, and he is finally told what is afoot. As soon as the mock ceremony ends, Norina turns into a fiery shrew who torments Don Pasquale with her nasty short temper and extravagant ways. INTERMISSION Act III, Scene 1: Don Pasquale's mansionHaving turned Don Pasquale’s mansion into a kind of Hearst Castle, Norina invites the elite of the Hollywood film world to cavort at Don Pasquale’s expense. Exquisitely gowned, Norina brazenly leaves the house to attend a late-night concert, and as part of the plan, she drops a letter where Don Pasquale must find it. It is a love letter from Ernesto, inviting her to a rendezvous in the garden of the Hollywood Bowl. Don Pasquale realizes that he cannot endure the situation any longer. Furious, he calls Malatesta, who promises to fix everything. Act III, Scene 2: The garden of the Hollywood BowlDisguised as a Hollywood crooner, Ernesto sings a love song to Norina, who responds fervently for Don Pasquale’s eaves-dropping ears. Don Pasquale springs upon the conspirators, who then happily reveal their plot. Immensely relieved to discover that his marriage has been like scenes from a popular Hollywood sex comedy, Don Pasquale forgives everyone involved and happily gives Norina to Ernesto. - Courtesy of Chuck Hudson, stage director PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World - Pittsburgh Opera Presents Fresh Take on Donizetti's Don Pasquale Opera Wire - Pittsburgh Opera to Present Donizetti's 'Don Pasquale' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - The 5 best classical concerts in April Pittsburgh Magazine - April 2019: Best of Culture in Pittsburgh Broadway World - Photo Flash: Inside Pittsburgh Opera's Don Pasquale The Incline - What to do this week in Pittsburgh: April 22-28, 2019 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Behind The Curtain, April 24 Tribune-Review - Pittsburgh Opera gives classic 'Don Pasquale' a fresh take WPXI TV - 11 things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend (4/26-4/28) Pittsburgh in the Round - Pittsburgh Opera to Wrap 80th Season with a Hollywood Take on 'Don Pasquale' Hoodline - Performing and visual arts events in Pittsburgh this week Mt.

Siblings Hansel and Gretel are poor peasants. In a major parenting fail, their mother sends them to forage for strawberries in a haunted forest. They get lost and spend the night in the woods. The next morning, they stumble upon a gingerbread house inhabited by a witch who imprisons them. It will take all their wits to escape before she eats them! Since its premiere in 1893 this beloved opera has enjoyed great success. With Humperdinck’s sweeping score, this whimsical operatic confection is sure to delight both adults and children. Hansel & Gretel is an opera which makes an equally good date night, girls’ night out, and family outing. Originally written in German, Pittsburgh Opera will be performing it in English.

In the house of a broom-maker deep in a German forest, Hansel and Gretel have been left by their parents, who are off in town. The children are supposed to be at work, making socks and brooms; instead, Gretel recites a nursery rhyme, which Hansel interrupts with complaints of hunger. Gretel teases her brother, calling him a complaining grump. She shows him a pitcher of milk hidden in the cupboard that their mother is saving for supper. To entertain her brother, Gretel teaches Hansel a folk dance. Suddenly Gertrude, their mother, comes home and angrily reproves them for playing when they should have been working. In her anger, the mother knocks over the pitcher of milk. When Hansel is caught grinning at this misfortune, his mother chases him out of the house and sends Gretel after him into the woods to find wild strawberries. The mother falls asleep just as the voice of her husband Peter is heard singing in the distance. Slightly tipsy when he arrives, he surprises Gertrude with all the food he has bought and tells her that he sold his brooms to a wedding party for the best price he has ever received. They celebrate their good fortune with a toast and he then asks where the children are. When Gertrude tells him that they have gone to the woods, he is horrified. He tells her about the Witch who lives there and who bakes children into bread. The two rush off to find Hansel and Gretel. ACT II. In a forest glade, Gretel sings another nursery rhyme and then begins making a wreath of wild flowers. Hansel picks the last of the wild strawberries. He offers his basket to Gretel, who eats one; as they start to leave, a cuckoo calls, and the children parrot the bird’s call, eating strawberries all the while. As darkness falls, they realize they cannot refill the basket, and worse, that they are lost. Their fears multiply as they see visions of wild animals behind every tree. An old man appears, scattering gold sand and promising restful sleep. When the Sandman leaves, the two children kneel to say their prayers and quickly fall asleep. In their dream, Hansel and Gretel are surrounded by a host of children, who seem to have a message for them. ACT III. The Dew Fairy brings morning to the world of the forest. The children awake and find themselves still in the forest. They happen upon a magical house, filled with cakes and sweets. When Hansel breaks a piece off from the gingerbread house, they hear a voice from somewhere inside the dwelling. An old lady comes out and offers the children desserts of all kinds; when the children refuse her temptations, she puts a spell on them and locks Hansel in a cage. Gretel is released from the spell to help set the Witch’s table. Gretel has overheard the Witch’s plan to bake her, and while the Witch feeds Hansel to fatten him up, Gretel whispers the Witch’s magic words, which break the spell on Hansel. Hungry for Gretel, the Witch calls her to the oven. Gretel cleverly asks the Witch to show her how to make the oven work. As the Witch leans in, Hansel and Gretel push her in and slam the door. The oven gets hotter and hotter until it explodes. Suddenly, the room is filled with other children. Hansel recites the Witch’s spell and the children spring to life. As Peter and Gertrude rush in and embrace their children, a gingerbread cake of the Witch is found in the oven. Before eating, all join in giving thanks for their deliverance. -Adapted from Opera News PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World: Photo Flash: First Look at Pittsburgh Opera's Hansel & Gretel Carnegie Library: Staff Picks for Hansel & Gretel Pittsburgh in the Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s Ashley Fabian on Upcoming Production of “Hansel & Gretel” The Urban Twist: A Delicious Treat and Feel Good Time With Corrie Stallings As Hansel The Almanac: Mt.

With a libretto by Stephanie Fleischmann, The Long Walk is based on the book The Long Walk: A Story of War and the Life that Follows by Brian Castner. The opera is a deeply personal exploration of a soldier’s return from Iraq where he served as an officer in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit and his battle with what he calls “the Crazy” as he tries to reintegrate into his family life. ‘The Long Walk’ is the term for when a bomb disposal expert puts on their bomb suit and walks, alone, towards an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) which they must disarm. As Castner explains in an interview, “It is an extremely lonely experience; no one can help you.” However, ‘the long walk’ also refers to the struggle to re-integrate back into your own life upon returning to the United States, a struggle which Castner shares with brutal honesty. For additional background, view American Lyric Theater’s YouTube video featuring interviews with Beck, Fleischmann, and Castner. Commissioned by American Lyric Theater in 2012, the opera was developed under the auspices of the Composer Librettist Development Program, and premiered at Opera Saratoga in 2015. The Times Union called it “a daring operatic depiction of war’s aftermath”; another reviewer said it “hits on all that makes us human”. Brian (Ben Taylor) tries to read his boys Virgil, Martin, and Samuel (Simon Nigam, Harrison Salvi, River Beckas) a bedtime story. Brian (Ben Taylor) wakes up from a nightmare, and his wife Jessie (Leah de Gruyl) tries to comfort him. Brian (Ben Taylor) visits a psychologist (Shannon Jennings) about his \"Crazy.\" Perneatha (Adrianna Cleveland) mourns the loss of her husband, fellow EOD soldier to Brian. The EOD soldiers (Eric Ferring and Thomas Shivone) suit up Castleman (Martin Bakari) to take the long walk in one of Brian's memories.

The story concerns a “little nobody” named Nemorino. Nemorino is smitten with the beautiful and wealthy Adina, who appears to be completely out of his league. His prospects are further diminished when the handsome and dashing Sergeant Belcore arrives. But when Doctor Dulcamara rolls into town and sells Nemorino a bottle of his dubious Elixir of Love, things get very interesting. Why is Nemorino suddenly popular with every girl in the village? Will he win Adina's love before it's too late? With a sunny 1950s-style production that's new to Pittsburgh, The Elixir of Love is full of charming romance and light-hearted fun. Wigle Whiskey will be providing free samples of their very own Elixir of Love in the Benedum lobby during all four performances. Using Wigle’s own Rhubarb Liqueur as a base, this bright, lively concoction is loaded with vibrant flavor and personality – just like Dr. Dulcamara himself. \"A Fellini-esque vision of scooters, cappuccino machines and champagne fountains, set on a sun-washed hotel terrace overlooking the sea…”-The Guardian The crowd bids Dr. Dulcamara (Paolo Pecchioli) and his assistant (Simon Nigam) a fond farewell.

Nemorino, whose name accurately describes him as a “little nobody,” is smitten with the wealthy Adina, but can’t inspire love in her heart. Nemorino sees Adina reading a book in the village square and wonders how a fool like him could possibly win her love. Everyone begs Adina to tell the story, so she reads the tale of Tristan, who bought a love potion from a magician in order to win the hard-hearted Isolde. If only they knew how to get the recipe! A drum roll signals the arrival of a platoon of soldiers headed by handsome Sergeant Belcore. Arrogantly likening himself to Paris wooing a goddess, Belcore immediately proposes to Adina, much to Nemorino’s dismay. But when Adina says she needs time to think it over, Nemorino seizes the moment and declares his undying love for her once again. Irritated, Adina declares that she is capricious and fickle—he should look for love elsewhere. Scene 2. Dr. Dulcamara, a fast-talking quack, arrives and sings the praises of his amazing elixir, guaranteed to cure all diseases—and even chase away mice and bugs! Nemorino, who falls for the con like everybody else, asks if Dulcamara carries Isolde’s love potion. Dulcamara gives Nemorino a bottle of Bordeaux, warning him that it will only take effect after twenty-four hours (giving Dulcamara time to get away) and that he must keep it a secret. Nemorino drinks enough to get tipsy, so when Adina comes by he is so full of confidence that he pretends to ignore her. Aggravated to find her swain so impervious to her charms, she promises to marry Belcore in six days. Nemorino isn’t worried because the elixir will be in effect the next day. But Belcore receives orders to leave the village in the morning, so Adina agrees to marry him immediately. Now that Nemorino is really desperate, Adina enjoys his torment. She invites everyone to the marriage feast, and they all mock the dunce who thought he could defeat the dashing Belcore. ACT II.Scene 1. While they’re waiting for the notary to arrive at the wedding, Dr. Dulcamara entertains everyone with a comic song. Adina, however, hesitates to continue because Nemorino isn’t there—she wants to complete her revenge. After the company goes off for the wedding toast, Nemorino sneaks in and begs Dulcamara for help. Always obliging, he prescribes another dose, but Nemorino is broke. Belcore finds Nemorino alone and talks him into signing up—what a victory to enlist your own rival! Nemorino accepts, hoping the elixir will work before he leaves with the soldiers. Scene 2. Rumor has it that Nemorino’s uncle has died, leaving him as heir to a fortune. All the girls flirt with Nemorino, who doesn’t know about the inheritance and thinks the potion is finally working. Adina is astonished at his popularity and realizes that she is jealous. When Dulcamara brags that it was his elixir that worked the miracle, Adina also learns that Nemorino has sold his freedom for her. She realizes that she is in love with him, and Nemorino is delighted to see her shed a tear on his behalf. Adina takes action, buying back the enlistment papers from Belcore and admitting to Nemorino that she loves him. When Dulcamara tells everyone about Nemorino’s inheritance, Dulcamara claims the credit—his elixir is so powerful, it can make rich men out of poor ones! As he leaves town in triumph, everyone wishes him well, except Belcore. ~Taken from Pittsburgh Opera's 2007 The Elixir of Love Study-Guide PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera Concludes 2017-18 Season With L’Elisir D’Amore Pittsburgh Magazine: April: Best of Culture in Pittsburgh Trib Live: Entertainment Planner: April 12-25 Trib Live: What Western PA Needs to Know This Week Pittsburgh in the Round: Pittsburgh Opera’s Season To Close with The Elixir of Love Trib Live: The Elixir of Love is a perfect 'starter opera' OperaWire: Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Student Matinee’ To Bring 2,000+ Schoolchildren To Benedum Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Pittsburgh Opera: On the sunny side with Donizetti's The Elixir of Love The Urban Twist: Come Listen To Ashley Fabian Sing Songs Of Amour in ‘Elixir Of Love’ OperaWire: Top 5 Operas to See This Weekend – North America The Almanac: What's Happening: Week of April 18 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Review - Pittsburgh Opera's The Elixir of Love Pittsburgh in the Round: The Elixir of Love Wavy Alabaster: A Girl and Her First Opera: Pittsburgh Opera Presents Donizetti's The Elixir of Love The Incline: What to do this week in Pittsburgh: April 22-28, 2018 The Almanac: What's Happening: Week of April 25 WQED: Voice of the Arts Podcast for The Elixir of Love Dimitri Pittas - Nemorino Ekaterina Siurina - Adina Daniel Slater - Director Christian Capocaccia - Conductor Burgh' Vivant: SHANNON JENNINGS – Soprano, Pittsburgh Opera The Urban Twist: How Pittsburgh Opera Education Program Isn’t Just Another Field Trip VIDEO EXCERPTS Adina (Ekaterina Siurina) talks about the magic love potion in the story of Tristan & Isolde, wishing she knew the recipe.

The opera is based on the famous novel of the same name by Herman Melville, about Captain Ahab’s monomaniacal pursuit of a legendary white whale in his ship the Pequod. Pittsburgh Opera will be performing an exciting new production of Moby-Dick, which we co-produced with Utah Opera and which debuted in Salt Lake City this January. The Salt Lake Tribune praised that “Erhard Rom’s abstract set design, Jessica Jahn’s exhaustively researched costumes and Kristine McIntyre’s authoritative stage direction pull the audience into the action.” Video of Utah Opera's performances of Moby-Dick in January, 2018. Pittsburgh Opera was a co-producer and will be performing the same production with several of the same cast members. The world-class cast includes two singers making their Pittsburgh Opera debuts plus some returning favorites. Canadian tenor Roger Honeywell returns to Pittsburgh as the obsessed Captain Ahab, who will stop at nothing to wreak his revenge on the giant whale that previously took off his leg. Honeywell also sang the role in Salt Lake City this January, where his “fierce performance brought Ahab to terrifying life” according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Former Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Sean Panikkar, last seen here in the world premiere of The Summer King – The Josh Gibson Story, sings the role of whaling neophyte Greenhorn, aka Ishmael in the book. Texas baritone Michael Mayes brings his “powerful” voice and “arresting stage presence” to his Pittsburgh Opera debut as Starbuck, the Pequod’s First Mate, who is torn between his duty to his captain and his duty to himself. Also debuting is Musa Ngqungwana, a South African bass-baritone, as tattooed harpooner Queequeg, who befriends Greenhorn. The Dallas Observer called him a “powerful presence” when he portrayed Queequeg in 2016, and Limelight Magazine said he was “gorgeously resonant” in Utah this January. Antony Walker conducts. Kristine McIntyre directs. Dancers provided by Attack Theatre. Captain Ahab (Roger Honeywell) entices the Pequod’s crew with a gold doubloon for whomever spots the dreaded white whale Moby-Dick.

Day One: The whaling ship Pequod has been at sea for one weekCaptain Ahab stands alone on deck in the hours before dawn. Below deck, while most of the crew sleeps, the harpooneer Queequeg prays and wakes Greenhorn, a loner and newcomer to whaling. Dawn breaks and the call is made for \"All Hands!\" While the crew is raising the ship's sails, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask talk about Ahab, whom no one has seen since the ship left Nantucket. The crew sings of whales, wealth and home when suddenly, Captain Ahab appears. He tells them of Moby Dick, the white whale that took off one of his legs, then nails a gold doubloon to the mast and promises it to the man who first sights him. This is the real reason they have sailed, he explains: to search the globe to find and destroy this one whale. His rousing call of \"Death to Moby Dick!\" excites everyone but the first mate, Starbuck. To no avail, he confronts Ahab about what he sees as a futile and blasphemous mission. Starbuck instructs Greenhorn about the dangers of whaling. When he ponders never again seeing his wife and son, he is overcome with emotion and orders Queequeg to complete the lesson. Stubb sights a pod of whales, but Ahab will not allow the eager crew to hunt since they have not yet found Moby Dick. Starbuck orders the crew to sail on and sends Greenhorn up to the lookout on the masthead, joined by Queequeg. As the sun begins to set, Ahab looks over the wake of the ship and mourns that his obsession deprives him of any enjoyment of beauty. All is anguish to him. At the masthead, Queequeg and Greenhorn look over the world, while Starbuck, on deck, bemoans Ahab's madness. Scenes 5 to 7. Day Two: Three months laterAfter three months without a single whale hunt, Stubb jokes with the young cabin boy Pip about the sharks circling the ship. The song ignites a dance for the full crew, but rising tensions take over and a dangerous racial fight erupts. When Greenhorn suddenly sights a pod of whales, Starbuck is at last able to persuade Ahab to let the men hunt. Starbuck and Stubb harpoon whales, but Flask's boat is capsized and Pip is lost at sea. On board the Pequod, an enormous whale is being butchered and the oil rendered in the burning tryworks. Flask tells Ahab that the search for Pip is under way, but Ahab thinks only of finding Moby Dick. As they butcher the whale, the crew imagines Pip lost and struggling in the heart of the sea. Flask tells Starbuck that many oil barrels are leaking and he goes below to tell Ahab they must find a port for repairs. Ahab is unmoved by Starbuck's report, and is concerned only with the white whale. When Starbuck refuses to leave, Ahab grabs a musket and orders him to his knees. From afar, Greenhorn shouts that Pip has been found. Ahab orders Starbuck out of the cabin. On deck, the crew listens to Greenhorn describe how Queequeg rescued Pip. As the men return to work, Greenhorn pleads to Starbuck to get help for Pip, who has gone mad. But, the first mate ignores him. Greenhorn observes how life really works on the ship and decides to befriend Queequeg. Starbuck returns to Ahab's cabin, where he finds the captain asleep. He picks up the musket with which Ahab had threatened him and contemplates what he should do. Pull the trigger and he may survive to see his wife and child again. When Ahab cries out in his sleep, Starbuck replaces the musket and leaves the cabin. Act 2 Scenes 1 to 3: Day Three: One year laterAn enormous storm is approaching, but Stubb, Flask and the crew sing a jolly work song. From the mastheads, Greenhorn and Queequeg talk of traveling together to his native island. Greenhorn wants to learn Queequeg's language and write down their adventures. Suddenly, Queequeg collapses. The crew gets him down and Ahab announces he will take the masthead watch himself, as he wants to sight Moby Dick first. Below deck, Queequeg tells Greenhorn that he is dying and asks that a coffin be built for him. Pip enters from the shadows and sings a lament, joined by Greenhorn. The massive storm now surrounds the Pequod. As Ahab sings defiantly to the heavens, bolts of lightning engulf the ship and the masts glow with St. Elmo's fire. Ahab demands that the men hold their posts, promising them the white flame is a sign from heaven to guide them to the white whale. The crew is inspired once again by the captain, much to Starbuck's distress. Scenes 4 to 7. Day Four: The next morningThe ship has made it through the storm. From afar, the voice of Gardiner, captain of the Rachel, calls out. He pleads with Ahab to help him search for his 12-year-old son who was lost in the storm, but Ahab refuses. Pip shouts to Gardiner of the Pequod's own lost boy. Pip cuts himself and gets blood on Ahab's clothes. The captain orders the ship to sail on, leaving Gardiner behind. Ahab contemplates the heartless God who devastates so many lives and baptizes his new harpoon with Pip's blood. Below deck, Greenhorn sees Queequeg's newly built coffin and contemplates the madness that seems to surround him. On deck, Ahab and Starbuck gaze over the horizon. Ahab describes his forty years at sea and all he has left behind. And why? To what end? He cannot say. But he sees in Starbuck's eye a human soul and it touches him deeply. Starbuck seizes the moment and persuades Ahab that they should return to the wives and sons who wait for them in Nantucket. Just as Ahab appears to relent, he sights Moby Dick on the horizon. Great excitement ensues and the whale boats are lowered. Ahab looks again in Starbuck's eye and orders him to stay on board. The crew declares its loyalty to Ahab. During the chase, Moby Dick destroys two whaleboats in succession, drowning their crews. Then, the Pequod is rammed and sunk, killing all aboard. Ahab's boat is then attacked and all but the captain jump or fall off. Finally alone with the white whale, Ahab cries out and stabs at Moby Dick before being dragged down into the sea. Epilogue: Many days laterGreenhorn floats on Queequeg's coffin, barely alive, softly singing his lost friend's prayer. Gardiner calls from afar, thinking he has at last found his missing son. Instead, he learns that Ahab and all the crew of the Pequod have drowned, except for this one survivor. ~from Wikipedia PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World - Pittsburgh Opera Presents MOBY-DICK, Herman Melville's Tragic Tale About The Price Of Obsession Opera Wire - Pittsburgh Opera To Present Moby Dick For The First Time The Almanac - Learn all about operatic Moby-Dick at Mt.

The crew of the Pequod sets sail on their ill-fated whaling voyage in good spirits. Starbuck (Michael Mayes), agonizes over whether he should kill crazed but sleeping Captain Ahab (Roger Honeywell) in order to potentially save the lives of himself and the ship's crew. The Pequod is hit by a fierce storm while Captain Ahab (Roger Honeywell) is aloft. The Pequod's bored crew amuses themselves while they wait for the ship's lookout to spot whales to hunt. Greenhorn (Sean Panikkar) begins to realize the contrast between the majority of the Pequod's bloodthirsty-but-ostensibly-Christian crew and his \"savage\", \"pagan\" but kind friend Queequeg (Musa Ngqungwana).

Tosca combines political intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal and murder with powerful music to create an unforgettably operatic experience. We are thrilled to present Leah Crocetto in the title role of Tosca. Perennial favorite Mark Delavan sings the role of Scarpia, one of the great villains not just in opera, but in the canon of Western storytelling. Tenor Thiago Arancam returns to Pittsburgh Opera after his sizzling debut in March as Prince Calaf in Puccini’s Turandot. Police chief Scarpia is hunting escaped political prisoner Cesare Angelotti. Angelotti is aided by artist Mario Cavaradossi, who is dating beautiful opera star Floria Tosca. Scarpia imprisons and tortures Cavaradossi to force Tosca to reveal Angelotti’s hiding place, and has even more sadistic intentions as well. Will Tosca submit? Will Scarpia keep his end of the bargain? See for yourself why Tosca is one of the most powerful operas ever written. Evil Baron Scarpia (Mark Delavan) sings of his obsession for opera star Floria Tosca while around him the church is conducting a Te Deum service. Floria Tosca (Leah Crocetto) and Mario Cavaradossi (Thiago Arancam) share a playful moment. Scarpia (Mark Delavan) attempts to intimidate Mario Cavaradossi (Thiago Arancam) Scarpia's cronies give Mario Cavaradossi (Thiago Arancam) the business.

Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide in the Attavanti chapel. As he vanishes, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the Angelus. Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene, inspired by the Marchesa Attavanti (Angelotti's sister). Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the Marchesa Attavanti in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he has just found, bearing the Attavanti crest. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”). ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, who is brought in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. No sooner has Scarpia written a safe-conduct document for the lovers than Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand. ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two hail their future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real.

The opera's story involves Prince Calaf, who falls in love with the icy Princess Turandot, played by Alexandra Loutsion. To obtain permission to marry Turandot, a suitor has to solve three riddles; a single wrong answer results in death. Prince Calaf is dazzled by Turandot's beauty and wants to attempt to solve her three riddles. His father Timur, and Timur’s servant Liù- who is secretly in love with the Prince- plead with him in vain not to attempt the riddles. Calaf correctly solves the riddles, but Turandot still refuses to marry him. Calaf offers her a way out: learn his name before dawn, and he will die after all. Believing that no one will reveal his name, the Prince waits for dawn and anticipates his victory, singing his famous aria \"Nessun dorma\". Turandot realizes that Liù knows Calaf’s name, and attempts to torture it out of her. Liù withstands the torturing, declares that she will not reveal his name, then seizes a dagger from a soldier's belt and stabs herself. The Prince reproaches Turandot for her cruelty, then takes her in his arms and kisses her. Turandot feels herself falling for him and is conflicted. She admits that, ever since he came, she has both hated and loved him. She asks him to leave, taking his secret name with him. The Prince however, reveals his name and places his life in Turandot's hands. Ultimately, she realizes she loves him too, and spares his life. The lovers embrace while the crowd rejoices.

Although it’s been performed numerous times in Europe, this will mark only its second United States performance.

Betrayal, greed, love and war- all the ingredients for a thrilling opera. Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists will dazzle you in a brand new production.

On her journey to be married to King Richard, Costanza and her party are shipwrecked off the coast of Cyprus. She finds shelter at the court of the local governor, Isacio. Isacio’s daughter Pulcheria is engaged to Oronte, Prince of Syria, but Oronte is quickly attracted to the beautiful Costanza, as is Isacio himself. King Richard arrives in Cyprus to collect Costanza, who Isacio promises to deliver. However, Isacio is up to no good. He intends to send his daughter Pulcheria to King Richard, in place of Costanza, and keep Costanza for himself. Costanza and her servant Berardo suspect treachery, and Berardo promises to investigate. Isacio informs Pulcheria of his plot. She is conflicted. She does not want to be party to a fraud, but, she sees an opportunity to punish her unfaithful lover Oronte. King Richard arrives, disguised as his kingdom's ambassador. Pulcheria presents herself to Richard as Costanza. Berardo has discovered the plot, and relays it to Oronte, who reveals the treachery to a now angry King Richard. Richard vows to either return with Costanza or avenge himself by force of arms. He offers Isacio the choice of either peace or war. Isacio chooses war, with Costanza as the proposed prize. The armies battle, and Richard’s army captures Isacio. Isacio must renounce his power, but is allowed to live. Pulcheria, now reconciled with Oronte as her husband, shall reign in place of her father. And of course Richard and Costanza sail off into the sunset where, as the chorus sings, “gentle, sweet affection will set their hearts aglow.” VIDEO EXCERPTS The following videos were recorded at Pittsburgh Opera's full dress rehearsal, January 19th, 2017 at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater. Everyone celebrates Isacio’s defeat. Their \"memories of tribulation...will vanish out to sea\", while \"gentle, sweet affection will set our hearts aglow...\" King Richard I pumps up his troops to attack the vile, treacherous Isacio.

However, now it’s considered a classic. Salome helped reinforce Strauss’s reputation as “the greatest genius of the age”. Based on the play by Oscar Wilde, Salome reimagines the biblical story of King Herod, his stepdaughter Salome and John the Baptist - Jochanaan. Salome provides one interpretation of why exactly Salome forced Herod to give her John the Baptist’s severed head on a silver platter. We are thrilled the title role of Salome will be sung by Patricia Racette, who sang the role to critical acclaim last year, including the famous, seductive “Dance of the Seven Veils”*. The dance is being choreographed by Michele de la Reza of Attack Theatre. Two-time Grammy winner Nmon Ford makes his Pittsburgh Opera debut as Jochanaan. Robert Brubaker plays King Herod, and Michaele Martens is Herodias. Music Director Antony Walker conducts. Season sponsor: PNC. Tuesday performance** sponsor: Ambridge Regional Distribution and Manufacturing Center. *The dance will contain brief nudity **The “Meet the Artists” reception after the Tuesday 11/8 Salome has been canceled due to intense interest in the Presidential election results. We regret any inconvenience. Pennsylvania voting locations will be open from 7 AM–8 PM. Please remember to vote before coming to the Tuesday performance.

Princess Salome is obsessed with Jochanaan, who is being held prisoner in her father King Herod’s dungeon. She is filled with an overwhelming desire for him and wants to kiss him, but he rejects her. King Herod, meanwhile, fancies his own daughter Salome, much to his wife Herodias’ disgust. Herod implores Salome to dance for him, promising to reward her with her heart's desire – even if it were one half of his kingdom. Sensing an opportunity, Salome agrees and performs the seductive “Dance of the Seven Veils”. This dance, a sort of biblical strip tease, has her slowly removing her seven veils until she lies naked at her father’s feet. Having danced for her father, Salome intends to make good on Herod’s promise to give her whatever she wants. What she wants is the head of the prophet Jochanaan, presented on a silver platter. Herod tries to no avail to change her mind, and ultimately he is forced to accede to her demands. Salome holds her trophy triumphantly. Jochanaan had prevented her from kissing his lips before- now she mocks him and passionately kisses his severed head. Disgusted and terrified, Herod has his guards kill Salome as the curtain falls.

La traviata tells the heart wrenching story of courtesan Violetta Valéry, played by Pittsburgh favorite Danielle Pastin, last seen here in 2015’s Cosi fan tutte. Like so many of Verdi’s works, La traviata explores grand themes through intimate family drama. Alfredo Germont – played by Cody Austin in his Pittsburgh Opera debut – wins Violetta’s love and his father’s displeasure. His father, going behind Alfredo’s back, coerces Violetta into breaking up with Alfredo because their relationship threatens his daughter’s engagement and his family’s reputation. Violetta will not disclose his father’s role in their breakup, so Alfredo erroneously believes she loves someone else. He publicly denounces her, leaving them both grief-stricken. Will they reconcile before it’s too late? From the rousing “Brindisi” drinking song to touching arias, La traviata’s singing and music are sure to delight. Christian Capocaccia conducts the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra and Chorus. Chas Rader-Shieber directs. Season sponsor: PNC. Tuesday performance sponsor: Ambridge Regional Distribution and Manufacturing Center. Cody Austin, Danielle Pastin and the Pittsburgh Opera Chorus perform the fun and flirtatious 'Brindisi'.

Moved, Violetta attempts to warn Alfredo, saying that she “doesn’t know how to love.” Besides, as you’ll hear in a stunning aria, Violetta wants to be ‘sempre libera’ – always free. “Free and aimless she must flutter, from pleasure to pleasure.” Alfredo eventually wins Violetta over, and they move to a house in the country. Alfredo sings about how happy he has been ever since Violetta told him “I want to live, faithful to you alone.” However, Alfredo’s father Giorgio Germont disapproves of Violetta’s relationship with Alfredo, because it threatens his family’s reputation and also his daughter’s engagement. He coerces Violetta into breaking up with Alfredo, then returns to console his son and remind him of his loving family back home in Provence. Alfredo confronts Violetta at a party. She will not disclose his father’s role in their breakup, so Alfredo erroneously believes she loves someone else. Angry, he scorns her and storms off. Violetta and Alfredo are both miserable. Six months later, Germont finally confesses his plot to Alfredo. Alfredo regrets the way he mistreated Violetta and attempts to reconcile. Violetta, however, is sadly succumbing to tuberculosis, and bids farewell “to happy dreams of by-gone days.” Alfredo's father enters with a doctor, regretting what he has done. However, it is too late- she dies in Alfredo's arms.

The plot follows Tom Rakewell, who squanders his large inheritance on women, drinking and gambling. Tom’s journey from fortunate heir, to gambler, to inmate at Bedlam is based on a famous series of engravings by William Hogarth from 1732. The opera itself is by Igor Stravinsky, who was inspired by Hogarth’s engravings. It premiered in 1951. The libretto was written by poets W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman. Pittsburgh Opera is performing the David Hockney production, with jaw-dropping sets, props, wigs and costumes designed by “the most influential British artist of all time”. Hockney mimics the feel of Hogarth’s original engravings, using black cross hatching and the three colors printers used in Hogarth’s time: red, blue and green. The performances are essentially a living David Hockney art installation set to Stravinsky’s beautiful neo-classical music. For an overview of what this means, please see Glyndebourne’s YouTube video “The Rake's Progress: An Introduction” below, which includes an interview with David Hockney. See Pittsburgh Opera's videos of our full dress rehearsal below, in the \"Video excerpts\" section of this webpage.

Study Guide for THE RAKE'S PROGRESS* (PDF), created by our Education department Run time for THE RAKE'S PROGRESS: 3 hours, 5 minutes, including 2 intermissions Understand Every Word: Supertitles shown at all performances Parking Downtown: get real-time parking availability Audio Description available at The Benedum Center Braille Programs available at The Benedum Center Large-Print Programs available at The Benedum Center SYNOPSIS Act IAnne Trulove is admiring the springtime in the garden of her father's house with her suitor, Tom Rakewell. Anne’s father sends her into the house and tells Tom he has arranged an accountant's job for him. Tom declines the offer and declares his determination to live by his wits and enjoy life.When Tom says \"I wish I had money,\" a stranger introduces himself as Nick Shadow, and tells Tom that a forgotten rich uncle has died, leaving the young man a fortune. Anne and Trulove return to hear the news, and urge Tom to accompany Shadow to London to settle the estate. As Tom leaves, promising to send for Anne as soon as everything is arranged, Shadow announces, \"the Progress of a Rake begins.\"At a brothel in the city, whores entertain a group of dissolute young playboys; together they toast Venus and Mars. Shadow coaxes Tom to recite for the madam, Mother Goose, the catechism he has taught him: to follow nature rather than doctrine, and to seek beauty and pleasure. Tom refuses, however, to define love. Seeing that Tom is restless to escape, Shadow turns back the clocks and commends him to the pursuit of hedonism in the brothel. Tom responds with ruminations of love. When the whores offer to console him, Mother Goose claims him for herself and leads him off.As evening falls, Anne leaves her father's house, determined to find Tom, since she has heard nothing from him.Act IITom begins to tire of city pleasures and no longer dares to think of Anne. When he says \"I wish I were happy,\" Shadow appears, showing a poster of Baba the Turk, a bearded lady whom he urges Tom to marry, because only when one is obligated to neither passion nor reason, can one be truly free. Amused by the idea, Tom gets ready to go out.Anne approaches Tom's house but hesitates to knock when she sees servants enter with strangely shaped packages. Tom arrives, and startled to see Anne, he says she must forget him. Baba calls out from the sedan, and Tom admits to the astonished Anne that he is married to Baba. Anne faces the bitter realities, while Tom repeats that it is too late to turn back. As Tom helps Baba from the sedan, a curious crowd gathers. Anne hurriedly leaves.Tom sulks amid Baba's curios as she chatters about them. When he refuses to respond to her affection, she complains bitterly. Tom silences her and she remains motionless as Tom falls asleep. Shadow wheels in a strange contraption, and when Tom awakens, saying \"Oh I wish it were true,\" the machine turns out to be his dream: an invention for making stones into bread. Seeing it as a means of redemption, Tom wonders whether he might again deserve Anne. Shadow points out that the device will attract potential investors.Act IIITom’s business venture has ended in ruin, and his estate is being auctioned, complete with a mute and motionless Baba. Amid rumors as to what has become of Tom, Anne enters in search of him. The auctioneer Sellem hawks various objects – including Baba, who resumes her chatter after the crowd bids to purchase her. Indignant at finding her belongings up for sale, she orders everyone out. She draws Anne aside, saying the girl should try to save Tom, who still loves her. Anne, hearing Tom and Shadow singing in the street, runs out.Shadow leads Tom to a graveyard with a freshly dug grave, where he reminds the young man that a year and a day have passed since he promised to serve him: now the servant claims his wage. Tom must end his life by any means he chooses before the stroke of twelve. Suddenly, Shadow offers a reprieve: they will gamble for Tom's soul. When Tom, placing his trust in the Queen of Hearts, calls upon Anne, and her voice is heard, Shadow realizes he has lost. In retaliation, he condemns Tom to insanity. As Shadow disappears and dawn rises, Tom – gone mad – imagines himself Adonis, waiting for Venus.In an insane asylum, Tom declares that Venus will visit him, and his fellow inmates mock him. Anne arrives, and believing her to be Venus, Tom confesses his sins. Briefly they imagine timeless love in Elysium, and Tom asks her to sing him to sleep. As she does, her voice moves the other inmates. Trulove comes to fetch his daughter, who bids the sleeping Tom farewell. When he wakens to find her gone, he cries out for Venus.EpilogueThe principals gather to tell the moral that each finds in the story. Anne warns that not every man can hope for someone like her to save him; Baba warns that all men are mad; Tom warns against self-delusion, to Trulove's agreement; Shadow mourns his role as man's alter ego; and all concur that the devil finds work for idle hands.- courtesy of Opera News, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Broadway World - Photo Flash: Meet the Cast of THE RAKE'S PROGRESS at Pittsburgh Opera Pittsburgh in the Round - A Word or Two from Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director, Christopher Hahn, on “The Rake’s Progress” WORDS &TC - A Pittsburgh Art Blog - David Hockney at the Pittsburgh Opera 'Burgh Vivant - The “Buzz” from Buzzelli: Pittsburgh’s Top To Do’s THIS WEEKEND (4/28 – 5/1) Pittsburgh City Paper - Short List: April 27 - May 5 The Almanac - Pittsburgh Opera ends season with Pittsburgh premiere WQED podcast interview with General Director Christopher Hahn WQED podcast interview with Layla Claire (Anne Trulove) WQED postcast interview with Alek Shrader (Tom Rakewell) WQED podcast interview with Maestro Antony Walker Pittsburgh Post Gazette preview - Pittsburgh Opera gets Hockney production Pittsburgh Post Gazette music preview - Recalling the American premiere of Stravinsky’s magnificent 'The Rake’s Progress' Pittsburgh Tribune Review preview - 'Rake's Progress' combines talents of Stravinsky, Auden and Hockney Broadway World - Photo Flash: Meet the Cast of THE RAKE'S PROGRESS at Pittsburgh Opera WESA-FM - Pittsburgh Opera's 'Rake's Progress' Bridges Distant Centuries Pittsburgh Tribune Review review - 'Rake's Progress' a compelling tale with a superb cast Pittsburgh Post Gazette review - Pittsburgh Opera mounts Stravinsky's 'The Rake's Progress' in high style Treading Art preview - The Rake's Progress NEXT pittsburgh preview - David Hockney and Igor Stravinsky converge at Pittsburgh Opera Broadway World - STAGE TUBE: Scenes from THE RAKE'S PROGRESS at Pittsburgh Opera (Video Content) Local Arts Pgh - Win Mother’s Day with “The Rake’s Progress” VisitPittsburgh blog - \"The Visitors Guide to the Pittsburgh Opera\" VIDEO EXCERPTS Below are video excerpts recorded at our full dress rehearsal on April 28. 2016. \"Here I Stand\" - Tom Rakewell (Alek Shrader) has turned down a steady job.

An American doughboy stationed in Paris becomes a friend, and provides them with coal and cigarettes, but fails to return with sought-after eggs. Another boy is added to the tally of the lost generation.After the war, Gertrude’s attention shifts from painters to writers, now welcoming the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the photographer Man Ray. Ernest and “Scotty” are desperate for Gertrude’s endorsement, so she encourages them to wrestle for her attention – she will announce the winner a genius. As the next war approaches, the writers are expelled from the salon.Gertrude and Alice survive the Second World War by sacrificing paintings. Picasso’s portrait of Gertrude preys on her conscience, asking her to explain how a Jewish-American authoress survived Nazi-occupied France. The guilt eats away at her, and she dies in Alice’s arms.Alice, now alone, is surprised by the return of Picasso. Together they say goodbye to the portrait of Gertrude as it is being shipped to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Picasso sketches an image of Gertrude for Alice as the bells of genius and love chime once more.- Courtesy of the composer and librettist, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS NewMusicBox.org interviews librettist Royce Vavrek NEXTpittsburgh previews 27 Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents interview Ricky Ian Gordon WQED-FM podcast interview with Adelaide Boedecker, who sings Alice Toklas WQED-FM podcast interview with Laurel Semerdjian, who sings Gertrude Stein WQED-FM podcast interview with Jennifer Williams, stage director WQED-FM podcast interview with Mark Trawka, Director of Musical Studies and Chorus Master Pittsburgh Post Gazette preview article, with interviews with Ricky Ian Gordon and Royce Vavrek Tribune Review preview article, including an interview with Ricky Ian Gordon Essential Pittsburgh on WESA 90.5 FM podcast interview with Laurel Semerdjian and Adelaide Boedecker Tribune Review review - Pittsburgh Opera production about Gertrude Stein a winner Pittsburgh In The Round - \"27\" Pittsburgh Post Gazette review - Pittsburgh Opera creates a Parisian salon in the Strip City Paper review VIDEO EXCERPTS On opening night Pittsburgh Opera was proud to host composer Ricky Ian Gordon and librettist Royce Vavrek.

Study Guide for THE BARBER OF SEVILLE (PDF), created by our Education department Run time for THE BARBER OF SEVILLE: 2 hours, 45 minutes, including 1 intermission Understand Every Word: Supertitles shown at all performances Parking Downtown: get real-time parking availability Audio Description available at The Benedum Center Braille Programs available at The Benedum Center Large-Print Programs available at The Benedum Center SYNOPSIS Act I Count Almaviva comes disguised as a student to the film studio of producer Dr. Bartolo and serenades starlet Rosina, whom Bartolo keeps under contract and closely guarded. Figaro, the barber-turned-hair stylist and make-up artist who knows all the town’s scandals, arrives. He explains to Almaviva that Rosina is Bartolo’s protégée, not his daughter, and that the producer intends to marry her. Figaro devises a plan: the Count will disguise himself as a drunken soldier with orders to be assigned to Bartolo’s studio so that he may gain access to the girl. Almaviva is excited and Figaro looks forward to a nice cash reward. Enchanted by the Count’s serenade, Rosina resolves to use her considerable wiles to meet its owner, whom the Count leads her to believe is a poor student named Lindoro. Bartolo appears with Rosina’s music director, Don Basilio. Basilio warns Bartolo that Count Almaviva, who has made known his admiration for Rosina, has been seen on the Seville set. Bartolo decides to marry Rosina immediately. Figaro, who has overheard the plot, warns Rosina and promises to deliver a note from her to Lindoro. Bartolo suspects that Rosina has indeed written a letter, but she outwits him at every turn. Angry at her defiance, Bartolo warns her not to trifle with him. Almaviva arrives, creating a ruckus in his disguise as a drunken soldier, and secretly passes Rosina his own note. Bartolo is infuriated by the stranger’s behavior and noisily claims that he has an official exemption from casting guest soldiers. Figaro announces that a crowd has gathered outside, curious about the argument they hear coming from inside the studio. The sheriff bursts in to arrest Almaviva, but when the Count secretly reveals his true identity to the official, he is instantly released. Everyone except Figaro is amazed by this turn of events. Act II Bartolo suspects that the “soldier” was a spy planted by Almaviva. The count returns, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a music coach and student of Don Basilio. He announces he will give Rosina her music lesson in place of Basilio, who, he claims, is ill. “Don Alonso” tells Bartolo that he is staying at the same hotel as Almaviva, and has found a letter from Rosina. He offers to tell her that it was given to him by another woman, seemingly to prove that Lindoro is toying with Rosina on Almaviva’s behalf. This convinces Bartolo that “Don Alonso” is indeed a student of the scheming Basilio, and he allows him to give Rosina her music lesson. She sings an aria, and, with Bartolo dozing off, Almaviva and Rosina declare their love. Figaro arrives to give Bartolo his shave, and manages to snatch the key that opens the doors to the studio’s balcony. Suddenly, Basilio shows up, looking perfectly healthy. Almaviva, Rosina, and Figaro convince him with a quick bribe that he is sick with scarlet fever and must go home at once. While Bartolo gets his shave, Almaviva plots with Rosina to elope that night. But the producer overhears them and furiously realizes he has been tricked again. Bartolo summons Basilio, telling him to bring a notary so Bartolo can marry Rosina that very night. Bartolo then shows Rosina her letter to Lindoro, as proof that he is in league with Almaviva. Heartbroken and convinced that she has been deceived, she agrees to marry Bartolo. A thunderstorm rages. Figaro and the Count climb a ladder to the film studio’s balcony and let themselves in with the key. Rosina appears and confronts Lindoro, who finally reveals his true identity as Count Almaviva. Basilio shows up with the notary. Bribed and threatened, he agrees to be a witness to the marriage of Rosina and Almaviva. Bartolo arrives with the others, but it is too late. Almaviva explains to Bartolo that it is useless to protest and Bartolo accepts that he has been beaten. Figaro, Rosina, and the Count celebrate their good fortune.- courtesy of Opera News, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Pittsburgh Post Gazette preview - \"Pittsburgh Opera's 'Barber of Seville' opens with one of opera's most famous arias\" Pittsburgh Tribune Review preview - \"Rom-com 'Barber of Seville' updated to golden age of filmmaking\" WQED FM podcast interview with Jonathan Beyer WQED FM podcast interview with Kevin Glavin WQED FM podcast interview with Christopher Hahn WQED FM podcast interview with Antony Walker Entertainment Central Pittsburgh's April Theater Preview Pittsburgh Magazine interviews Kevin Glavin Pittsburgh Post Gazette review - \"Pittsburgh Opera gives classic 'Barber of Seville' a Hollywood makeover\" Pittsburgh Tribune Review review - \"Pittsburgh Opera fans will be glad to meet this updated 'Barber of Seville'\" Pittsburgh in the Round review - \"The Barber of Seville\" NEXTpittsburgh article- \"Pittsburgh Opera presents fresh new take on The Barber of Seville\" Video highlights from BroadwayWorld.com Local Pittsburgh article - \"For Pittsburgh Opera’s “Barber of Seville”, Kevin Glavin Knows How to Bring Out Laughs\" Entertainment Central's Cool Picks - \"Pittsburgh Opera running The Barber of Seville\" Broadway World review - \"BARBER OF SEVILLE Amuses and Delights\" VIDEO EXCERPTS Here are four video excerpts from our full dress rehearsal on March 31, 2016: Michele Angelini sings the role of Count Almaviva, who sings of his love for the beautiful Rosina in this excerpt from the famous aria \"Ecco, ridente in cielo.\" Figaro (Jonathan Beyer) sings of his awesomeness as the luckiest, busiest and smartest fellow in town in this excerpt from the famous aria \"Largo al factotum.\" Rosina (Corrie Stallings) is not to be trifled with. As she sings in this excerpt from \"Una voce poco fa\", she's sweet as honey, but if you push her around she'll stand her ground. Bartolo (sung by the one and only Kevin Glavin) warns Rosina (Corrie Stallings) not to try to pull one over on him in this excerpt of \"A un dottor della mia sorte\". BULLDOG AUDITIONS In this production, Bartolo owns two bulldogs. We therefore set about conducting an exhaustive search for our two newest cast members. It started with a simple Facebook post announcing the casting call. The post got 607 likes, 337 comments and 208 shares, and resulted in one heck of a fun audition on Saturday, March 5th. We are pleased to announce that, of the many wonderful dogs who auditioned, Charmin (on left, with official opera headgear) and Milton were chosen. The Post Gazette covered the auditions; their article \"Dog day afternoon at the Pittsburgh Opera\" was on the front page of Sunday's The Region section. WTAE-TV had a segment about the auditions as well, seen here on their YouTube channel. Thank you everyone who responded and brought their wonderful pooches to audition!

Laurie has just married Jo’s sister Amy, and has fallen quite out of love with Jo. She claims relief and good cheer, though she is genuinely sad. Oblivious to Jo’s true feelings, Laurie proposes a return to their easy rapport of years ago. This infuriates Jo, and she mocks the very idea of trying to stop time from changing the ones she loves.Act IIn a scene going back two years, Jo and her three sisters—Meg, Beth, and Amy—bicker as they make a game of their chores. A round of the game Truth or Fabrication reveals something about each of the sisters: Meg’s secret romance; Amy’s conflicted relationship with Laurie; Jo’s devotion to her sisters; and Beth’s insistence that she is healthy. As they go down to supper, they sing an anthem in close harmony.Laurie taunts Jo with the secret that his tutor, John Brooke, keeps one of Meg’s gloves as a token of his love. Jo scoffs at the idea that her sister would “go filling her head with lovering rubbish.” Laurie reminds her that “Things change.” Jo starts rewriting her latest melodrama, but can’t shake the feeling that Meg may soon leave the family, and tells herself that she and her sisters remain \"perfect as we are.\"Meg offers to teach her suitor John Brooke a storytelling game called Rigmarole. Brooke’s story so clearly reflects his love for Meg that Jo chases him away, protesting to Meg that Brooke is too old for her. \"He’s twenty-eight! He’s got one foot in the grave!\"Jo pleads with the entire family to convince Meg to rebuff Brooke. Meg retorts that rejecting him was her plan all along. Cecilia March, the girls’ glamorous aunt, sweeps in just as Brooke bluntly proposes marriage to Meg. Cecilia scorns Brooke, and this only hardens Meg’s resolve. To her own surprise, Meg pledges herself to Brooke. The family congratulates the new couple, but Jo is devastated.Desperate, Jo accuses Meg of abandoning her. Meg placates her sister, replying, \"Things change, Jo.\" Then she confesses her true love for Brooke, wounding Jo even more deeply.The next summer, the family prepares for Meg’s wedding, and Meg and Brooke decide to use the wedding vows that Alma and Gideon wrote for their ceremony. As the parents teach the young couple their vows, a feverish Laurie accosts Jo, confessing his desire for her. Amy overhears the argument. Furious, Jo spurns Laurie, and he flees. Amy bursts in and accuses Jo of heartlessness, before following Laurie out. Regrouping from the episode, Jo thinks that if she gives Laurie some time he’ll change back into the friend she’s always cherished. Jo retreats to the house to write just as Beth, overwhelmed by illness, collapses.Act IIIn New York City, Dashwood, the publisher of The Daily Volcano, negotiates with Jo to purchase her latest melodrama. He offers her 25 dollars for an edited version; Jo insists on 30 dollars and two free copies. She wins her bargain.Triumphant, Jo returns to her boarding house, and writes to her family. Meg and Brooke are now the parents of twins; Amy and Laurie are in Europe; and Beth continues to deny that her health is failing. Distracted, Jo accepts an offer of supper and the opera by a new acquaintance at her boarding house, Friedrich Bhaer.In a split scene, Jo and Bhaer spiritedly argue points of taste in New York; in Oxford, Amy delicately asks Laurie what he feels for Jo. Meanwhile, in Concord, Beth at last acknowledges the defeat that awaits her. Jo playfully challenges Bhaer to endorse a worthier art than the melodramas she enjoys, and he recites a Goethe poem, in German. Jo asks for a translation, and Bhaer’s English rendering is a confession of love. Receiving a telegram saying that Beth has taken a turn for the worse, Jo flees to Concord.The family keeps vigil over Beth. Dismissing the others, Beth urges Jo to accept her impending death and makes Jo promise to take care of the family. Jo accedes and they both fall asleep. When Jo awakes, Beth has died.A few months later, Cecilia baits Jo with Amy’s latest letter, which confirms that she and Laurie are very much in love. Jo admits that she hasn’t heard from Friedrich Bhaer recently. Cecilia stuns Jo with the news that she will leave her estate to her: the endowment will render Jo independent for the rest of her life. Cecilia urges Jo to use the wealth to isolate herself from the pain that comes from loving others. Appalled, Jo rejects the offer and flees to her attic space.Laurie enters the attic, suggesting innocently that they go back to the “perfect way it was,” but this time Jo admits that the happy old times can’t come back. Laurie leaves, and Jo calls on her memories of the sisters, and ghostlike, they materialize. In gratitude, she celebrates what they were and releases them to what they are now, before they disappear.Unexpectedly, the attic door opens again: it’s not Laurie but Friedrich, in town by chance and eager to see her. “Is now a good moment?” he asks. “Now is all there is,” Jo realizes. She extends her hand to him as the opera concludes.- Courtesy of the composer, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Tribune Review preview- Pittsburgh Opera brings Little Women to the stage Burgh Vivant interviews the four March sisters in a fun video NEXTpittsburgh previews Little Women Entertainment Central Pittsburgh (ECPGH) touts Little Women as part of What's Up In January Don411 promotes Little Women Broadway World promotes Little Women Mt.

Their older friend, the cynical Don Alfonso, declares that a woman’s constancy is like the phoenix—everyone talks about it but no one has ever seen it. He proposes a wager: if they’ll give him one day and do everything he asks, he will prove to them that the sisters are unfaithful, like all other women. Amused, the young men agree.Fiordiligi and Dorabella think of their lovers, imagining that they will soon be married. Alfonso’s plot begins when he arrives with terrible news: the young officers have been called away to their regiment. Ferrando and Guglielmo appear, apparently heartbroken, and the four make tearful farewells.The sisters’ maid Despina complains about how much work she has to do around the house. Dorabella vents her despair at her lover’s absence. Despina refuses to take her seriously: they should simply find new lovers, since men are unworthy of a woman’s fidelity. Fiordiligi and Dorabella are shocked. Alfonso bribes Despina to assist him, without revealing his plot. Ferrando and Guglielmo enter in disguise as foreigners, and declare their admiration for the ladies, each addressing the other’s girlfriend. The sisters reject their advances, Fiordiligi comparing her constancy to a rock in a storm. The men are confident of winning the bet. Ferrando expresses his love for Dorabella, and the two friends leave.As the sisters continue to lament the absence of their lovers, the “foreigners” return, pretending to have poisoned themselves in despair over their rejection. Despina and Alfonso go off to fetch help, leaving the two girls to care for the strangers. Despina reappears, disguised as a doctor, and pretends to treat the patients. When Ferrando and Guglielmo request kisses in order to fully recover, the sisters again reject them, but it is clear they’re beginning to show interest in the strangers.Act IIDespina lectures her mistresses on how to handle men and the sisters agree that there can be no harm in a little flirtation. They decide on their partners, each picking the other’s suitor. Guglielmo, flirting with Dorabella, succeeds, but Ferrando has less luck with Fiordiligi. When he leaves, though, she struggles with her emotions.Ferrando is certain that they have won the wager. Guglielmo is happy to hear that Fiordiligi has been faithful to him, but when he shows his friend the portrait that Dorabella gave him, Ferrando is furious. Guglielmo, adopting Alfonso’s philosophy, blames it on the women. He asks Alfonso to pay him his half of the winnings, but Alfonso reminds him that the day is not yet over.Fiordiligi reproaches her sister for her behavior, but Dorabella replies that love is a thief who rewards those who obey him. Alone, Fiordiligi decides to join Guglielmo at the front, when suddenly Ferrando appears. He tries one last time to seduce her and succeeds.Guglielmo is furious, but Alfonso again declares that this is the way women are. A man who has been deceived can blame only himself.The sisters have agreed to marry the “foreigners.” Everything is ready and Alfonso arrives with the notary—Despina in another disguise. As Fiordiligi and Dorabella sign the contract, military music announces the return of their former lovers. In panic, they hide their intended husbands, who return as their real selves, first pretending surprise at their reception, then, when they discover the marriage contract, blaming the girls and threatening revenge. Finally, the men reveal their disguised identities and Fiordiligi and Dorabella ask forgiveness. Alfonso bids the lovers learn their lesson.- Courtesy of Opera News, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS PostGazette.com \"Pittsburgh Opera brings multi-faceted characters to life\" TribLIVE.com \"Pittsburgh Opera's 'Cosi Fan Tutte' delights\" Pittsburgh In The Round \"patronage is highly recommended\" TribLIVE.com (preview with Sir Thomas Allen) \"Actor does double duty as director of Pittsburgh Opera's Mozart production\" PostGazette.com (preview with Sir Thomas Allen) \"Sir Thomas Allen dons two hats\" Pittsburgh Owl Scribe (preview) \"Pittsburgh Opera continues its 77th season with a Mozart favorite\" Mt.

SYNOPSIS Part IIn the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, the Israelites pray for help against Nabucco (Nebuchadnezzar), the King of Babylon, who has attacked the city. Zaccaria, their high priest, enters with Nabucco’s daughter, Fenena, whom the Hebrews hold hostage. He reassures his people that the Lord will not forsake them. As the Israelites leave, Ismaele, nephew of the king of Jerusalem, is left alone with Fenena, who helped him escape from imprisonment in Babylon. Their conversation is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Fenena’s half-sister, Abigaille, with some Babylonian soldiers. Abigaille, who is also in love with Ismaele, tells him that she can save his people if he will return her love, but he refuses. The Israelites rush back into the temple in a panic, and when Nabucco enters with his warriors, Zaccaria confronts him, threatening to kill Fenena. Ismaele disarms Zaccaria and delivers Fenena to her father. Nabucco orders the destruction of the temple.Part IINabucco has appointed Fenena regent while he is away at war. Abigaille, back in the royal palace in Babylon, has found a document saying that she is not the king’s daughter, but the child of slaves. Foreseeing a future in which Fenena and Ismaele will rule together over Babylon, she swears vengeance on Nabucco and Fenena. The High Priest of Baal arrives with news that Fenena has freed the Israelite prisoners. As a result of Fenena’s treason, he offers the throne to Abigaille and spreads a rumor that Nabucco has died in battle. Meanwhile, Zaccaria prays for inspiration to persuade the Babylonians to give up their false idols. Ismaele enters and the priests accuse him of treachery, but Zaccaria announces that he has been pardoned for saving a fellow Israelite—the newly converted Fenena. An officer rushes in to warn Fenena that the king is dead and her life is in danger. Before she can escape, the High Priest of Baal arrives with Abigaille and the Babylonians, who proclaim Abigaille ruler. She is about to crown herself when, to the astonishment of all, Nabucco appears. He snatches the crown from her, faces the crowd and declares himself not only their king but their god. For this blasphemy, a thunderbolt strikes him down. A triumphant Abigaille takes the crown for herself.Part IIIIn the Hanging Gardens, the Babylonians hail Abigaille as their ruler. The High Priest urges her to have the Israelites killed, but before she can give the order, a disheveled Nabucco wanders in. Abigaille dismisses the crowd and, alone with Nabucco, tricks him into signing the death warrant for the captive Israelites. He asks what will happen to Fenena, and Abigaille replies that she too must die. When Nabucco tries to find the document proving Abigaille’s ancestry, she produces it and tears it to pieces. He pleads in vain for Fenena’s life. On the banks of the Euphrates, the Israelites rest from forced labor, their thoughts turning to their homeland. Zaccaria predicts they will overcome captivity and obliterate Babylon with the help of God.Part IVFenena and the Israelites are led to execution, and Nabucco can only watch, as he has been imprisoned by Abigaille. Desperate, he prays to the God of Israel for forgiveness, pledging to convert himself and his people. His sanity restored, he forces open the door and summons his soldiers to regain the throne and save his daughter. The Israelites are about to be executed. Fenena prays to be received into heaven when Nabucco rushes in and stops the sacrifice. Abigaille, full of remorse, takes poison and dies, confessing her crimes and praying to the God of Israel to pardon her. Nabucco announces his conversion and frees the Israelites, telling them to return to their native land and rebuild their temple. Israelites and Babylonians are united in praising God.- Courtesy of Opera News, freely edited PREVIEWS AND REVIEWS Nabucco receives first Pittsburgh Opera staging since 1973 - Post-Gazette Pittsburgh Opera opens season with the opera that made Verdi famous - Tribune-ReviewPittsburgh Opera brings back 'Nabucco' - Pittsburgh Owl Scribe REVIEW: 'Nabucco' is powerful, imaginative vision of Verdi's classic - Tribune-Review REVIEW: Pittsburgh Opera opens new season with 'Nabucco' - Post-Gazette REVIEW: Pittsburgh Opera opens season with a Verdi rarity and a success - PGH Stage THANKS TO OUR SPONSORS AND PARTNERS Season Sponsor: PNCSeason Media Sponsor: WQED-FMSupported in part by Pennsylvania Council on the ArtsSupported in part by Allegheny Regional Asset DistrictProud member of Opera AmericaOfficial Chocolatier: Sarris CandiesFilm Series Partner: Pittsburgh Filmmakers 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death.La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT.

In their Latin Quarter garret on Christmas Eve, the painter Marcello and poet Rodolfo try to keep warm by burning pages from Rodolfo's latest drama. They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina \"What a cold little hand\") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì \"Yes, they call me Mimì\"), embroidering flowers and waiting for spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla \"Oh lovely girl\"). ACT II. Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the elderly, wealthy Alcindoro. Trying to regain the painter's attention, she sings a waltz about her popularity (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns. ACT III. At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì walks by, searching for the place where the reunited Marcello and Musetta now live. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, she says. Rodolfo, who has been asleep in the tavern, is heard, and Mimì hides; Marcello thinks she has left. The poet tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). The painter and his mistress part in fury, but Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. ACT IV. Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra \"Old coat\"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? \"Have they gone?\"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name. -Courtesy of Opera News DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.

Written in the style of monastic plain song and laden with musical symbolism, this piece artfully melds theatrical simplicity with ecumenical grandeur.In keeping with these themes and this opera’s history, Curlew River will be staged at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside. Antony Walker conducts; Dana Kinney directs. PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATION Where: Calvary Episcopal Church, Shadyside When: Saturday, January 24, 2026 * 7:00 PM Tuesday, January 27, 2026 * 7:00 PM Friday, January 30, 2026 * 7:00 PM Sunday, February 1, 2026 * 4:00 PM CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAM The Ferryman: Erik Nordstrom* The Madwoman: Logan Wagner* The Abbot: Matthew Soibelman* The Traveler: Yazid Gray** Conductor: Antony Walker Stage Director: Dana Kinney* + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Alumnus SYNOPSIS The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant “Te lucis ante terminum.” The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God’s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman’s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy’s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost. She leads the lamentation, in which all join, her prayers mingling with images of birds and flight. A child’s voice is heard and the Spirit of the Child appears above the tomb. He blesses his mother with the promise that they will meet in Heaven. The Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller resume their monks’ habits and all recss chanting the “Te lucis.” – Hugh Macdonald, Mark Morris Dance Group DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Beloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he drunkenly schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. However, when these women uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget! The music matches the merriment and mischief of this madcap romp. See why Verdi’s buoyant comedy, based on Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor, is considered one of the best comedic operas of all time!Antony Walker conducts; Crystal Manich directs. These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

Dr. Caius bursts into Sir John Falstaff’s room in the Garter Inn, accusing him of unseemly behavior the previous night. He further accuses Falstaff’s two henchmen, Bardolph and Pistol, of having robbed him while he was drunk. Unable to obtain reparations, Dr. Caius leaves in a fury. Falstaff contemplates the large bill he has run up at the inn. He informs Bardolph and Pistol that in order to repair his finances he plans to seduce Alice Ford and Meg Page, both wives of prosperous Windsor citizens. When Bardolph and Pistol refuse to deliver the letters Falstaff has written to the two ladies, Falstaff instructs a page to do so instead. He then ridicules Bardolph and Pistol’s newly discovered sense of honor, before throwing them out of his room. The Garter Inn. Alice Ford and Meg Page laugh over the identical love letters they have received from Sir John Falstaff. They share their amusement with Alice’s daughter Nannetta, and with their friend Mistress Quickly. Ford arrives, followed by four men all proffering advice: Dr. Caius, whom Ford favors as Nannetta’s future husband; Bardolph and Pistol, who are now seeking advantageous employment from Ford; and Fenton, who is in love with Ford’s daughter Nannetta. When Ford learns of Falstaff’s plan to seduce his wife, he immediately becomes jealous. While Alice and Meg plan how to take revenge on their importunate suitor, Ford decides to disguise himself in order to pay a visit to Falstaff. Unnoticed in the midst of all the commotion, Nannetta and Fenton manage to steal a few precious moments together. ACT II The Garter Inn. Feigning penitence, Bardolph and Pistol rejoin Falstaff’s service. They show in Mistress Quickly, who informs Falstaff that both Alice and Meg are madly in love with him. She explains that it will be easier to seduce Alice, since her husband is out of the house every afternoon, between two and three. Falstaff joyously anticipates his seduction of Alice. Bardolph now announces that a “Mister Brook” (Ford in disguise) wishes to speak to Falstaff. To Falstaff’s surprise, “Brook” offers him wine and money if he will seduce Alice Ford, explaining that he has long been in love with the lady, but to no avail. If she were to be seduced by the more experienced Falstaff, she might then be more likely to fall a second time and accept “Brook.” Falstaff agrees to the plan, telling his surprised new friend that he already has a rendezvous with Alice that very afternoon. As Falstaff leaves to prepare himself, Ford gives way to jealous rage. When Falstaff returns, dressed in his best clothes, the two men exchange compliments before leaving together. Ford’s house. Mistress Quickly, Alice and Meg are preparing for Falstaff’s visit. Nannetta tearfully tells her mother that her father insists on her marrying Dr. Caius, but Alice tells her daughter not to worry. Falstaff arrives and begins his seduction of Alice, nostalgically boasting of his aristocratic youth as page to the Duke of Norfolk. As Falstaff becomes more amorous, Meg Page interrupts the tête-à-tête, as planned, to announce (in jest) that Ford is approaching. But just at that point Mistress Quickly suddenly returns in a panic to inform Alice that Ford really is on his way, and in a jealous temper. As Ford rushes in with a group of townsfolk, the terrified Falstaff seeks a hiding place, eventually ending up in a large laundry basket. Fenton and Nannetta also hide. Ford and the other men ransack the house. Hearing the sound of kissing, Ford is convinced that he has found his wife and her lover Falstaff together, but is furious to discover Nannetta and Fenton instead. While Ford argues with Fenton, Alice instructs her servants to empty the laundry basket out of the window. To general hilarity, Falstaff is thrown into the River Thames. ACT III Outside the Garter Inn. A wet and bruised Falstaff laments the wickedness of the world, but soon cheers up with a glass of mulled wine. Mistress Quickly persuades him that Alice was innocent of the unfortunate incident at Ford’s house. To prove that Alice still loves him, she proposes a new rendezvous that night in Windsor Great Park. In a letter that Quickly gives to Falstaff, Alice asks the knight to appear at midnight, disguised as the Black Huntsman. Ford, Nannetta, Meg, and Alice prepare the second part of their plot: Nannetta will be Queen of the Fairies and the others, also in disguise, will help to continue Falstaff’s punishment. Ford secretly promises Caius that he will marry Nannetta that evening. Mistress Quickly overhears them. Windsor Great Park. As Fenton and Nannetta are reunited, Alice explains her plan to trick Ford into marrying them. They all hide as Falstaff approaches. On the stroke of midnight, Alice appears. She declares her love for Falstaff, but suddenly runs away, saying that she hears spirits approaching. Nannetta, disguised as the Queen of the Fairies, summons her followers who attack the terrified Falstaff, pinching and poking him until he promises to give up his dissolute ways. In the midst of the assault Falstaff suddenly recognizes Bardolph, and realizes that he has been tricked. While Ford explains that he was “Brook,” Quickly scolds Falstaff for his attempts at seducing two younger, virtuous women. Falstaff accepts that he has been made a figure of fun, but points out that he remains the real source of wit in others. Dr. Caius now comes forward with a figure in white. They are to be married by Ford. Alice brings forward another couple, who also receive Ford’s blessing. When the brides remove their veils it is revealed that Ford has just married Fenton to Nannetta, and Dr. Caius to Bardolph. With everyone now laughing at his expense, Ford has no choice but to forgive the lovers and bless their marriage. Before sitting down to a wedding supper with Sir John Falstaff, the entire company agrees that the whole world may be nothing but a jest filled with jesters, but he who laughs last, laughs best. — Metropolitan Opera DETAILS & RESOURCES We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera. FAQS - GENERAL QUESTIONS Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it? No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together? It depends. If you and your partner always attend the opera together, i.e. you always buy two seats together, and you plan on attending at least three performances this coming season together, then you should buy two Opus Passes - one for you and one for your partner. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. If your \"+1\" guest changes from show to show - sometimes your significant other comes with you, but other times you bring a neighbor, friend, or work colleague - you should not buy two Opus Passes, because each Pass is issued in a specific person's name. Instead, when you redeem your Pass for a specific performance, mention that you need to add on a second ticket. You can purchase additional tickets at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance? Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together. I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I? Yes! Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you. Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them? No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund. Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events? Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately. FAQS - OPUS PASS SUBSCRIPTION ADD ON I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass? Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. Subscribers who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price. Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription? If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly? Subscribers who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments. Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway? Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost. If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On? If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

The first, Iphigénie en Tauride, was composed in 1779 by Christoph Willibald Gluck. Based on Euripides’ great Greek drama Iphigenia in Tauris, it is the powerful Trojan War-era tale of a sister whose duty requires that she kill a man who turns out to be her brother. The second, Proving Up, premiered in 2016. Composed by Grammy Nominee Missy Mazzoli, with a libretto by Royce Vavrek based on a short story by Karen Russell, it “offers a surreal and disquieting commentary on the American dream through the story of a 19th-century Nebraskan homesteading family.” Iphigénie en Tauride will be performed at the Pittsburgh CAPA School Theater, downtown, on January 20, 23, 26, and 28, 2024. Proving Up will be performed at the Bitz Opera Factory, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, on February 17, 20, 23, and 25, 2024. Combined, these two operas showcase the art form’s heritage and illustrate its continued relevance and staying power. They demonstrate opera’s unique ability to combine music, singing, and stagecraft to tell compelling human stories. Both operas showcase Pittsburgh Opera’s award-winning Resident Artists. Tickets for both operas are available online at opera.culturaldistrict.org, by phone at 412-456-6666, or in-person at the Theater Square Box Office, 655 Penn Ave downtown. Tickets for children and teens ages 6–18 are half-price.

Long-time Board member Gene Welsh took the helm when Pittsburgh Opera’s new fiscal year began on July 1st, at the end of previous Board President Dr. Donald R. Fischer’s term. “Don did a fantastic job as Board President,” says Mr. Welsh. “His term included the entirety of the COVID pandemic. I am grateful to be entering a situation where the organization not only has a strong artistic product, but also a strong balance sheet and community support.” Mr. Welsh had previously served as Board President prior to Dr. Fischer. “Pittsburgh Opera is indeed fortunate to have Gene for a second, nonconsecutive term,” says Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn. “His leadership and dedication will serve us well as we continue to bring world-class opera to the greater Pittsburgh community.” In addition, the following people have joined Pittsburgh Opera’s Board: Hilda Fu – she is the founder and president of Luminari, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit founded to broaden minds, inspire innovation and promote community engagement by specializing in inspirational teen summer programs. Ms. Fu, who returns to Pittsburgh Opera’s Board after having served previously, has also served on the Boards of nonprofits such as the Allegheny Regional Asset District, WQED-Multimedia, and the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania. Paul J. Gitnik – he has had a long and varied career as an attorney, business owner, software developer, professor, and civic leader. A returning Pittsburgh Opera Board member, Mr. Gitnik also currently serves on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, and has served on the Boards of organizations including the Allegheny Regional Asset District, Animal Friends, and Phipps Conservatory, among others. Dominic Rupprecht – as Policyholder Advocate and Litigation Partner at Reed Smith, Mr. Rupprecht litigates insurance coverage disputes on behalf of policyholders nationwide. A frequent speaker and publisher on insurance law issues, he is also the current vice chair of the River City Brass Band’s Board and was valedictorian at Penn State Law. “These three talented, passionate individuals strengthen our Board considerably,” says Mr. Hahn. “It is gratifying and humbling that they have given us this vote of confidence in our programming and community engagement initiatives.” 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

Photo by Dan Norman. Pittsburgh Opera’s first production of its 2022–23 season is Dvořák’s Rusalka, “Opera’s Little Mermaid”, September 17-25 at the Benedum Center. Rusalka is the Czech version of the popular fairy tale The Little Mermaid. While it has many similarities to the familiar animated movie, they are not exactly the same. First of all, her name is not Ariel, it’s Rusalka. Secondly, Rusalka is not a mermaid per se, but a water sprite, also called a water nymph. However, like the Little Mermaid, Rusalka falls in love with a human Prince. She has a witch turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Rusalka must win and keep the Prince’s love, or else there will be disastrous consequences for them both. Will a jealous Princess ruin Rusalka’s plan? Will Rusalka’s father be able to bail her out if things go awry? Will true love triumph? Rusalka premiered in 1901 and has become one of the most beloved lyric fairy tales of all time. These are the first-ever performances of Rusalka in Pittsburgh Opera’s 84-year history. Music Director Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs.

As always, English supertitles will be projected above the stage. Jaroslav Kvapil wrote Rusalka’s libretto based on the Czech folktale written by Karel Jaromír Erben and Božena Němcová; it is similar-to-but-not-the-same-as Danish author Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 story The Little Mermaid. Rusalka contains the beautiful and famous ‘Song to the Moon’, where Rusalka asks the Moon to tell the Prince of her love.

Disguises. Romantic Compromises. Photo by Dana Sohm Pittsburgh Opera continues its 2022–23 season with Mozart’s beloved The Marriage of Figaro November 5–13 at the Benedum Center. The Marriage of Figaro is one of the most popular comic operas of all time. Filled with amusing cases of mistaken identity and romantic subterfuge, plus music by a Mozart at the height of his powers, The Marriage of Figaro has stood the test of time for centuries. Figaro is in love with the Countess’s servant Susanna, who he plans to wed that very day. However, their employer Count Almaviva has his eye on Susanna. In fact, the Count intends to invoke the hated feudal practice of droit de seigneur—the infamous right of the lord to sleep with a commoner’s bride on her wedding night. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess are understandably outraged at this possibility, and are determined not only to prevent it, but to teach the Count a lesson. The Marriage of Figaro is the perfect introduction to opera, and makes a great date night. Tickets start at just $15. English supertitles are projected above the stage. In addition, Pittsburgh Opera’s annual Student Matinee will introduce 2,500+ school students grades 3-12 to this lively, colorful opera on Thursday, Nov. 10 at the Benedum Center. Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists take lead roles in the Student Matinee, and are accompanied by the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra. Tickets are $12, and are reserved through Pittsburgh Opera’s Education Department. For more information, please contact Marilyn Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education via email.

FUN FACTS Fun facts about The Marriage of Figaro Thanks to its abundant use in pop culture, virtually everyone knows the music from The Marriage of Figaro. The overture has been used in movies including Trading Places, The King’s Speech, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Zombieland. Tim Robbins’ character famously played the touching duet “Sull 'aria” over the prison loudspeaker in The Shawshank Redemption, despite knowing the malicious warden would put him in solitary confinement for it. Although it may seem hard to believe given its enduring popularity, The Marriage of Figaro (the play) was initially banned from being performed by French King Louis XVI, and opera librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte had to rework certain elements of the play to get the opera approved by Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. The Marriage of Figaro was the second of three plays in a trilogy written by Pierre Beaumarchais in the 1700s, all of which have been turned into operas. While it and The Barber of Seville—the first of the three—continue to be operatic mainstays hundreds of years after they were written, the third (The Guilty Mother) is rarely performed.

Set in Medieval Scotland, Ariodante tells a tale of love, jealousy, deception, and redemption. Princess Ginevra, daughter of the King, loves and is betrothed to Prince Ariodante. Faithful to Ariodante, Ginevra rejects the advances of the vile Polinesso, who views Ginevra as a path to the throne. Polinesso makes it appear that Ginevra has been unfaithful to Ariodante. Both Ariodante and the King fall for the ruse. Ariodante contemplates suicide, and the King not only condemns his daughter, but disowns her too. Ginevra must clear her name and expose Polinesso’s treachery so that she and Ariodante can live happily ever after. Pittsburgh Opera is pleased to partner with Chatham Baroque for Ariodante. Founded in 1990, Chatham Baroque continues to excite local, national, and international audiences with dazzling technique and lively interpretations of 17th- and 18th-century music played on authentic period instruments.

Two Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist alumnae with local roots have big roles in these performances: Pittsburgh resident Marianne Cornetti is not just internationally recognized as one of the leading Verdi mezzo-sopranos of her generation, but has turned Azucena into her signature role. She’s performed it at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, the Metropolitan Opera, and such cities as Verona, Toyko, Beijing, Sao Paolo, and Tel Aviv. Canonsburg, PA native Alexandra Loutsion is returning to the Benedum for the first time since the COVID pandemic began. Her most recent Pittsburgh Opera performance was in the title role of 2019’s Florencia en el Amazonas. Il Trovatore, which in English means “The Troubadour”, premiered in 1853 to almost instant acclaim. It remains one of the most popular operas in the world.

Denis & Katya will be performed at the Bitz Opera Factory, 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District on May 6, 9, 12, 14, and 18. We Shall Not Be Moved will be performed at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center in downtown Pittsburgh on May 13, 16, 18, 19, and 21. OPERA America’s Opera Conference 2023, May 17-20, is the largest assembly of opera administrators, artists, trustees, and associates in the world. Hosted by Pittsburgh Opera, hundreds of stakeholders will convene for discussions, networking, and performances that move opera forward. Overview of the operas: Denis & Katya On November 14, 2016, Denis Muravyov and Katya Vlasova, fifteen-year-olds in the rural Pskov region of Russia, died after a three-day standoff with Russian Special Forces. They live-streamed their last hours onto internet sites, leaving behind a trail of devastating video footage: drinking and smoking, cuddling and crying, and preparing to die. Denis and Katya could have been your children, best friends, or classmates. Two teenagers who lived every moment—including their last—online. What led to their violent deaths? Why did they choose to broadcast their final moments on social media? And what does it say about the voyeuristic society that watched, liked, and objectified them in real-time, transforming two kids into clickbait? This visceral opera uses verbatim text to examine the vast public response to the events surrounding the tragedy of these two Russian runaways, exploring how stories are shaped and shared in our age of trolls, conspiracy theories, fake news, and 24/7 digital connection. The New York Times called Denis & Katya \"an intimate, haunting triumph\", and Musical America called it “ … the most brilliantly original operatic work I’ve seen in a decade.\" We Shall Not Be Moved On the run after a series of tragic incidents, five North Philadelphia teens find refuge in an abandoned, condemned house in West Philadelphia at the exact location that served as headquarters of the MOVE organization, where a 1985 standoff with police infamously ended with a neighborhood destroyed and 11 people dead, including five children. This self-defined family is assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home and begin to see their squatting as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear. Combining spoken word, contemporary movement, video projection, classical, R&B, and jazz singing, and a brooding, often joyful score filled with place, purpose, and possibility, We Shall Not Be Moved is a timely exploration of past and present struggles that suggests an alternate future through the eyes of its young protagonists. Tony Award-winner and Kennedy Center Honoree Bill T. Jones directs and choreographs; Viswa Subbaraman conducts.

Point Park Students worked with Pittsburgh Opera to select arias and other portions of well-known operas. They then designed, created, and refined six animated video shorts to bring the beautiful world of opera to life in new, exciting ways. The videos feature music by Mozart, Verdi, Dvořák, and more, from operas such as The Marriage of Figaro, Il Trovatore, and Rusalka. They will be unveiled publicly together for the first time – and will be accompanied by live performances of the opera music by singers from Pittsburgh Opera’s acclaimed Resident Artist program – at the free ‘Animated Arias’ concert. Image from the animation for the Anvil Chorus from Il Trovatore Rebekah Diaz, Pittsburgh Opera’s Director of Community Engagement and IDEA Initiatives, explains that the videos “can introduce opera to new audiences who might otherwise feel opera is ‘not for them’ while simultaneously inviting opera aficionados to look at opera in a new lens, explore the magic of animation, and inspire joy at viewing these well-loved pieces in a new context.” Image from the animation for “Canzonetta sull’aria” from The Marriage of Figaro Garfield Lemonius, Dean of the Conservatory of Performing Arts and Artistic Director of the Pittsburgh Playhouse, adds “We are committed to showcasing the work of our talented students and proud of the work our students did through this partnership. I encourage everyone to see this incredible work, which highlights how these two art forms intersect.” Image from the animation for “Tacea la notte placida” from Il Trovatore As part of the event, the students who created the animated videos will discuss their inspiration and the creative process. Pittsburgh Playhouse is at 350 Forbes Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh. Admission is free, but registration is required. Patrons can register online. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

Jonnet Solomon. Photo by Diondre Johnson. Ms. Solomon is the Executive Director and a founding member of National Opera House (NOH), a nonprofit organization working to restore and maintain the historic headquarters of the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), the first African-American opera company in the United States. The NNOC was founded in Pittsburgh by Mary Cardwell Dawson in 1941 and operated until her death in 1962. The NNOC headquarters building, located in Pittsburgh’s Homewood neighborhood, was placed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s 2020 list of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places, and is the subject of a massive rehabilitation effort. “Jonnet joining our Board further solidifies the partnership between Pittsburgh Opera and National Opera House,” says Pittsburgh Opera Board Chair Michele Fabrizi. The partnership includes developing curricula and programming in music education, artistic development, and community engagement. These curricula and programming will take place throughout the Greater Pittsburgh area, including at Pittsburgh Opera’s Headquarters the Bitz Opera Factory and at the NNOC House as various stages of renovation are completed, and beyond. “Being on the Board of Pittsburgh Opera helps fulfill Mary Cardwell Dawson’s mission, and will help enable continual close partnership between National Opera House and Pittsburgh Opera”, says Ms. Solomon. “Together, we will ensure that our shared programming and vision truly serve the needs of the entire community. I see this as a significant symbol of reconciliation.” Jonnet has an accounting degree from Duquesne University and is the founder of JSA, LLC, an accounting firm focused on start-ups and small business accounting, consulting and advising. She is also an artist and has been performing and teaching for many years. About National Opera House: ‘National Opera House’ or ‘NOH’ is a Nonprofit Organization with 501(c) (3) status, working to restore and maintain a historic home at 7101 Apple Street in Pittsburgh PA. The house rose to national significance in 1941, when Mary Cardwell Dawson, a celebrated musician and educator, rented the third floor of the house as an office and rehearsal space for the National Negro Opera Company, the first permanent African-American Opera company in the nation. The NOH also provides National Negro Opera Company™ programming. The NOH is supported through National Negro Opera House™ fundraising through donations and grants.

Operalia was founded in 1993 by Plácido Domingo to discover and honor the best new young Opera singers of today. Its annual competition is widely considered one of the most prestigious and competitive operatic showcases in the world. This year’s competition was held in Riga, Latvia. Ms. Carmack, a mezzo-soprano, was a Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons. Notable roles included Dorabella in Così fan tutte, where onStage Pittsburgh said she “sang with a velvety mezzo-soprano tone that was quite lovely,\" and Juno in Semele, where Opera News said she “used her wide coloristic range to expressive advantage.” Her Residency was generously sponsored by Hans and Leslie Fleischner. Simplify qualifying for Operalia is a significant accomplishment for any singer. Advancing through multiple rounds to be named a finalist, and then winning a prize in the finals, puts a singer in rarefied air. Maire Therese Carmack. Photo ©Nadine Sherman. “We couldn’t be happier for Therese” says Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn. “She is talented, hard-working, and a joy to be around. Therese made the most of her tenure here as a Resident Artist, and we are thrilled to see her career advancing so rapidly.” From Latvia, Ms. Carmack shared “I’m so grateful to the countless coaches, teachers, and mentors who invested in me and trained me to where I felt comfortable and expressive on that stage.” Ms. Carmack is in the midst of a year-long tenure with Deutsche Oper Berlin, where she made her European debut in the title role of Carmen as part of the company’s Cultural Summer Festival. Later this season she will make her Carnegie Hall debut as a participant in Renée Fleming's SongStudio. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Contact Us Directions & Parking Auditions Employment Media Releases Privacy Policy Site Map Board Of Directors Login BUY TICKETS GIVE NOW SUBSCRIBE ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA"

As the boy grows into a young man, he becomes a student artist and activist. His mother worries for his future, while his father tries to prepare him for the harsh realities of 21st-century America. The father also wrestles with his own identity as a police officer, a \"Black man in blue\", and the friction that causes within the family. When their deepest fears come true, the grieving parents must navigate the turbulent waters of loss at the hands of police, while seeking answers and support from their church and community. Tony Award®–winning composer Jeanine Tesori and NAACP Theatre Award–winning librettist Tazewell Thompson’s new opera is inspired by contemporary events and Black literature. Exploring race, violence, and reconciliation, Blue places timely issues at the forefront of modern opera and invites audiences to the emotional epicenter of their impact. Besides its traditional four-performance schedule, Pittsburgh Opera is adding a special student/community matinee as a fifth performance at 10:00AM on Thursday, April 28th. To bring your school or community group to this performance, please contact Pittsburgh Opera’s Wendy Parkulo at 412-281-0912, ext. 213. In addition, Pittsburgh Opera is hosting Opera Up Close: A Community Conversation at 2:00PM on Sunday, April 10th. This special virtual event with community leaders and Blue’s librettist and stage director Tazewell Thompson will discuss the opera’s major themes–fatherhood, motherhood, religious support, and police perspective, all from the perspective of the Black community. Participating in this panel discussion will be: Josiah Gilliam, Special Initiatives Coordinator for the City of Pittsburgh and formerly Coordinator and Program Manager for My Brother’s Keeper April Jackson from Open Up Pittsburgh Minister Dwayne Fulton, Minister of Music and Fine Arts at Mt. Ararat Baptist Church Blue librettist and stage director Tazewell Thompson Additional panelist(s) to be announced Audience members will have the opportunity to ask questions of all the panelists. Registration for this powerful conversation is free, and available online.
