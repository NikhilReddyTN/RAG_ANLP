Silent film stars Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis, courtesy of Harold Lloyd Entertainment LEGENDARY FILMMAKER MARTIN SCORSESE, PITTSBURGH AND CINEMAS ACROSS COUNTRY, EMBRACE INNAUGURAL NATIONAL SILENT MOVIE DAYSept. 4, 2021 – In April of this year, Mt. Lebanon resident Chad Hunter announced a new project called National Silent Movie Day—an annual event celebrating silent film history and raising awareness about the race to preserve surviving silent films. Since then, more than 30 theaters and institutions around the country have signed on to host their own events, including Film Forum in New York City, the National Museum of Asian Art in Washington DC, the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago, the Berkeley Art Museum in Berkeley, CA, and the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles. Writing on his Turner Classic Movies blog, legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese also took note, stating that “September 29th is the very first National Silent Movie Day, a great initiative launched by three dedicated film archivists and/or activists: Brandee B. Cox from the Academy Archive, Chad Hunter from Video Trust and the Pittsburgh Silent Film Society and Steven K. Hill from UCLA […] this is exactly the kind of activist spirit we need right now in the world of cinema.” Turner Classic Movies will celebrate the day with an all-silent film line-up, showing 15 movie titles from 6:00am to midnight, including Trip to the Moon (1902) by film pioneer Georges Méliès; Within Our Gates (1920) by Oscar Micheaux, considered the first feature-length motion picture produced by a Black filmmaker; Rudolph Valentino in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921); Harold Lloyd’s The Freshman (1925); Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights (1931), and Buster Keaton’s Sherlock, Jr. (1924).Locally in Pittsburgh, Hunter has partnered with Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville to present Alfred Hitchcock’s silent masterwork Blackmail (1929), with live piano accompaniment provided by musician Tom Roberts, former piano player for Leon Redbone and scorer of Martin Scorsese’s 2004 film The Aviator. Dr. Adam Hart, film scholar and author of Monstrous Forms, will provide a short introduction.Blackmail is scheduled for 7:00pm on Wednesday, September 29, tickets are $16 and available at https://rowhousecinema.com/movies/blackmail/. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID test taken within 72 hours is currently required to enter the theater. Guests under 12 may enter, but must be masked.

If you’d like to help, please email us (before you write anything) at pittsburghsilentfilmsociety@gmail.com. Olive Thomas Born in Charleroi near Pittsburgh on October 20, 1894. After her steelworker father died in a work-related accident in 1906, the family moved to McKees Rocks. She worked at Joseph Horne’s Department Store and Kaufmann’s in downtown Pittsburgh. She moved to New York City in 1913 and became a famous artist’s model and Ziegfeld Follies girl. She starred in numerous films, including OUT YONDER (1917), THE FLAPPER (1920), and her last and perhaps most successful film EVERYBODY’S SWEETHEART (1920). She was married to actor Jack Pickford, the younger brother of fellow silent-film star Mary Pickford. On September 10, 1920, Thomas died in Paris five days after ingesting her husband's syphilis medication, mercury dichloride, that brought on acute nephritis. Although her death was ruled accidental, news of her hospitalization and subsequent death were the subject of speculation in the press. Thomas' death has been cited as one of the early scandals in Hollywood that was heavily publicized. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.See Vincent Ciaramella’s Powerpoint with information on Olive Thomas’s Pittsburgh history HERE. Thomas Meighan Coming Soon …. Lois Weber Florence Lois Weber was born on June 13, 1879, in Allegheny City, now part of Pittsburgh. Some regard her as one of the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films. Film historian Anthony Slide wrote: \"Along with D. W. Griffith, Weber was the American cinema's first genuine auteur, a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies\". Some of her more notable films include HYPOCRITES, which featured the first full-frontal female nude scene; WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN, which discussed abortion and birth control and was added to the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough’s TARZAN OF THE APES for the very first Tarzan film; and THE BLOT. She is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including Mary MacLaren also (from Pittsburgh, see below), Billie Dove, Anita Steward, and also inspiring screenwriter Frances Marion. She died at 60 years old on November 13, 1939, destitute, from a bleeding ulcer. She was cremated, but the location of her remains are unknown. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. A Historic Marker was dedicated to her at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Allegheny branch in 2019. See a full article on Lois Weber by Thomas Wilson from The Allegheny City Society’s Reporter Dispatch HERE. Adolph Menjou Born in Pittsburgh on February 18, 1890, Menjou’s French father managed the Hotel Duquesne, where he met Adolph’s Irish mother, who also worked there. A few of his notable films include Charlie Chaplin’s A WOMAN OF PARIS, Kubrick’s PATHS OF GLORY with Kirk Douglas, THE SHEIK with Rudolph Valentino, A STAR IS BORN with Janet Gaynor, and he was nominated for an Oscar for THE FRONT PAGE. He famously publicly feuded with Katherine Hepburn over his cooperation with the HUAC hearings. He died on October 29, 1963 of hepatitis in Beverly Hills, CA and buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Richard Rowland Richard Rowland was born and raised in Pittsburgh, the son of James and Emma Morton Rowland. As a young boy growing up in the late 1800s, he delivered supplies for the family's calcium light business. Calcium lighting was used at that time for bright spots and floodlight effects in theaters around the city.Over the years, Rowland earned the nickname \"the Calcium Kid\" and became fascinated with the burgeoning movie industry. When movie houses asked Rowland whether he could supply rental films, he borrowed $2000 and expanded the business into film distribution. By 1908-1909, the company was touted as one of the nation's largest film rental companies.But the 1910s brought major changes to the movie world, as film production, distribution and exhibition became more standardized and centralized. Many independent distribution companies were swallowed up by the General Film Corporation (GFC.) In 1910, Rowland and his then partner James B. Clark sold their business to GFC for \"more money that I thought existed,\" Rowland said in a 1941 interview with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.But that didn’t end Rowland’s love affair with the movies. He and Clark opened a string of movie houses throughout the city, including the 1000-seat Regent Theatre, located at Penn and Highland avenues in East Liberty. In 1915, Rowland went to New York City to serve as the president of the newly launched Metro Pictures. Metro originally focused on movie distribution but soon announced plans to produce its own films. Rowland’s greatest success at Metro was the production of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which brought Rudolph Valentino to stardom.Rowland followed his stint at Metro with work at some of Hollywood’s biggest studios including First National, Fox Film and RKO. He died in 1947 in New York and is buried in Pittsburgh’s Homewood Cemetery.View of Richard Rowland: The Calcium Kid Finds a Future in Film | Western Pennsylvania History: 1918 - 2023 Lois Moran Coming Soon … Tom Mix Coming Soon ….

Motion pictures prove this point. Upon screening Cecil B. DeMille’s Birth of a Nation in 1915, Woodrow Wilson supposedly claimed: “This is like history writ with lightning!” But just as lightning is gone in a flash, so too is motion picture film.From 1896 until 1952, most movies were shot and released on cellulose nitrate film. Nitrate film has a chemical compo- sition similar to gunpowder; and if not stored correctly, can rapidly decay. Most of the films from the silent era are gone. Some say more than 80% are lost forever … READ ARTICLE From The Allegheny City Society’s Reporter Dispatch STREETCARS AND BLACKSMITHS - The story of Allegheny’s William Powellby Tom Wilson, Winter 2014 Number 62Permission by Tom WilsonMyrna Loy described the great actor William Powell as: “... a brilliant actor, a delightful companion, a great friend, and, above all, a true gentleman.” His years spent growing up in Allegheny City no doubt influenced Ms. Loy’s experience. That’s right: William Powell was from Allegheny City!William Horatio Powell was born July 29, 1892 to Horatio Warren Powell and Nettie Manilla Powell. His mother was originally a Brady. We have reason to believe that he was born in Allegheny .William Powell in the Pittsburgh Press/Post-Gazette from 1931, the reporter claims that Powell was born on Federal Street, but there are no listings in the Allegheny and Pittsburgh Directories for the Powells until 1893. These first listings are only for the places that father Horatio Powell worked. READ ARTICLE From The Allegheny City Society’s Reporter Dispatch KANSAS CITY TO HOLLYWOOD - Allegheny’s William Powell achieves stardomby Tom Wilson, Spring 2014 Number 63Permission by Tom WilsonIn our last Reporter Dispatch, we talked about William Powell’s early life in Allegheny. He would look back fondly onhis childhood here in his later years, and no doubt took many valuable lessons with him when in 1907, William Powell’sfather Horatio took a better job in Kansas City, and moved the family there. William became a leading citizen of the Kansas City High School, where he edited the school paper, sang in the glee club and participated in several activities. His success in a public speaking class led the teacher to suggest that Bill get involved in acting in the Shakespeare Club and perform in the school’s play. Bill loved acting, and decided that would be his career—not a career in law, as his parents had planned.When he lived in Manchester, his after-school job had been delivering dry cleaning from Pfieffer’s Allegheny Steam Laundry. This vital experience helped Bill get a job in the Gent’s Furnishing Department of the Emery Bird Thayer Dry Goods Store in Kansas City. There he learned the ways of haberdashery; he would always afterward be known for his excellent taste in clothing … READ ARTICLE OLIVE THOMAS IN PITTSBURGHA tour of the life of Olive before she set out for New York by Vincent CiaramellaPermission by Vincent Ciaramella READ ARTICLE Motion picture film was first commercially produced in 1889, but the innovation of adding a soundtrack directly onto the film next to the picture did not occur until the early 1930s. This roughly 40-year period marks the silent film era. Instead of soundtracks, movies had intertitles, or text, that described the action or dialogue for the events happening on the screen. But silent films weren’t “silent” - they almost always included live musical accompaniment on piano, theater organ, or by a small orchestra. Music was either improvised or performed from a score along with the movie, and it was as much a part of the cinema experience as what was seen on screen. The accompanying music teased dramatic tension, heightened pathos, humor and romance, and even added structure through recurring motifs and themes for different characters. The music brings the films to life. Films from the silent period were printed on flammable nitrocellulose film stock, and rather than risk deadly fires, theaters and studios often destroyed or reclaimed silver content from prints after their theatrical runs were completed. An estimated 75% of all silent films made during this time period are now considered lost forever. However, thousands of silent films still survive. Archives across the world work to preserve and restore these remaining movies, and a handful of film festivals and societies present them to the public as they become newly available. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival started in 1996 and has since become the largest annual silent film event in the US. Other silent film festivals are held in Chicago, Denver, and Kansas, and internationally in Canada and Italy. Pittsburgh itself has a rich silent film history, producing such global film stars as Adolphe Menjou, Olive Thomas, Thomas Meighan, Lillian Russell, and Lois Weber. In fact, the world’s first movie theater, The Nickelodeon, opened on Smithfield Street in downtown Pittsburgh in 1905. Just two years later in 1907 the Warner Brothers opened their first theater, the Cascade Picture Palace, in New Castle, PA. They went on to establish one of the most successful movie studios in the world. The majority of people in our region are not aware of Pittsburgh’s great film history, and have never seen a silent movie presented properly on a big screen with live musical accompaniment. Unfortunately, silent film programming in Pittsburgh has nearly vanished in recent years. The Hollywood Theater changed ownership and eliminated silent programming. The Melwood Screening room has permanently closed, and the Regent Theater, which previously hosted an annual silent film screening, is also now dark. With movie theaters being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, additional closures in our area are likely imminent. Our cinema landscape is in dire straits, and in need of quality film programming now more than ever. As the birthplace of the movie theater nearly 100 years ago, it is time for Pittsburgh to better showcase its rich cinematic history. Watch out for the 1st Annual Pittsburgh Silent Film Festival coming soon, and in the meantime, please catch our occasional screenings around the area!"

This was comforting to the closeted gay teenager who often felt alone and out of place in his Modern Orthodox Jewish family. After his grandfather dies, Noam discovers a mysterious note in his belongings, suggesting they might have had more in common than either of them ever knew.

But when she steals a handbag belonging to the head seamstress at Dior, a series of unexpected events is set in motion. Haute Couture is a witty and delightfully stylish modern-day Cinderella story and a glimpse behind the scenes of high fashion. Director and writer Sylvie Ohayon delivers a stunning and detailed look into the world of couture creation in a warm and relatable story of second chances. In the process, she shines a light on the extremely thin lines that separate the young and the old and the haves and have nots. Official Selection: New York Jewish Film Festival, Miami Jewish Film Festival “Ohayon has supercharged the chick flick into an elevated film de femme. It’s a firehose of sophistication.” — Michael Talbot-Haynes, FilmThreatFilmsHaute CoutureDetailsAsset 5"

Aumari, a young Eritrean refugee in the process of being deported, is mistaken for a professional soccer player being brought to Israel to help save the struggling Maccabi Netanya team. Despite having no soccer experience, he plays along and somehow manages to reinvigorate the floundering squad. Amid their quest for victory, he finds himself falling for the team owner's daughter and worrying if his true identity will be uncovered. Starring the charismatic Congo-born actor Chancela Mongoza and a group of other African migrant actors, Running on Sand has both humor and heart and sheds light on the challenges faced by refugees. Official Selection: Atlanta Jewish Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival “The movie hits the sweet spot between a truly light-hearted comedy and a real drama, with engaging characters you care about and funny situations, but with a strong narrative and a heartfelt message about treating people with respect, no matter where they are from.” Hannah Brown, The Jerusalem PostFilmsRunning on SandDetailsAsset 5"

In operatic fashion Bellocchio tells this harrowing tale of the Mortara family and their efforts to get their child back. Despite the family’s desperate pleas and public outrage, the Pope stands firm. Their story reveals a dark chapter of historical tyranny in the church set against the backdrop of a nation on the verge of revolution. Official Selection: Cannes Film Festival Winner: Best Film — Italian Golden Globes “A moving story of faith, loss and family set against the backdrop of a significant moment in Italian history, Kidnapped brings Edgardo Mortara’s unforgettable story to life.” — Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, Alliance of Women Film Journalists FilmsKidnapped: The Abduction of Edgardo MortaroDetailsAsset 5"

Set during the British occupation of Palestine in 1938, tensions are running high in Tel Aviv between its mixed population of Jews and Arabs and the Brits are struggling to maintain control. Amidst this chaos, an English police officer has fallen deeply in love with Shoshana, the daughter of the Zionist Labor movement’s founder. Their relationship is challenged by an Israeli paramilitary group’s violent campaign against both Arabs and the occupying British. As death threats loom, Shoshana is torn between her emotions and the peaceful pursuit of Jewish statehood. With exceptional craftsmanship, Winterbottom's 15-year passion project explores the legacy of British colonialism and draws disquieting parallels to contemporary political divisions.

Hear from Our Teaching Artists Being a teaching artist is probably one of the most fulfilling jobs I have ever had. The opportunity to help guide and mentor aspiring young artists is an awesome responsibility and an incredibly rewarding experience. It’s cliche to say that I have learned so much from teaching them, but it’s true. They push me to be a better artist and a more patient and compassionate person. Working with them makes me so optimistic for the future. —Ian Altenbaugh, Teaching Artist I love working with the teens because their inquisitiveness and ambitions challenge my assumptions of what’s possible. I’ve been working in media for over 18 years. While it’s important to teach the teens how we approach things as an industry as a teaching artist, their priorities and vision surprise and delight me every week I’m involved. —Edwin Huang, Teaching Artist I loved working at the Academy. Getting the chance not only to teach, but to collaborate and create with our emerging young filmmakers is an incredible experience. It’s a privilege to share the profound joy of cinema with this next generation of artists. —Jon Lefkovitz, Teaching Artist WQED Multimedia receives state arts funding support through a grant from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, a state agency funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
