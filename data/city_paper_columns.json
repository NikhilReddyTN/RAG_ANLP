For a long time, I didn’t really have an answer. Many publications do regular features on houses to buy because they are popular. I was asked to do one, except instead of focusing on big, beautiful, expensive houses, I was to focus on the “affordable” ones. Though, what that meant was left up to interpretation. In the process of actually writing this column, a new reason has emerged: it’s to showcase the less-traveled, less-desirable, most-overlooked parts of Pittsburgh, and reasons why I think it could be fun/interesting/OK to live there. Nobody needs to tell you why Lawrenceville and the Strip are great, but less renowned areas like Esplen, Mt. Oliver, Fairywood, Brighton Heights, etc., could sometimes use a little explanation. I swear I’m not trying to blow up anyone’s spot. (And no, I don’t know what to do about private equity buying up cheap houses in Carrick, but I think it’s bad and someone should stop it). However, I’m totally fine with just about anyone who wants to move in, buy an old house, take care of it, and contribute to the community/tax base/what-have-you. Maybe someday we’ll see Pittsburgh overrun with unpleasant amounts of tech bros, robber barons, Ravens fans, etc. But right now, I still see so many abandoned homes, trash-strewn hillsides and weedy empty lots. If someone wants to bring those places back to life, I’m all for it. Pittsburgh is an acquired taste, and if someone makes a good faith attempt to acquire it, that’s good enough for me. For sale: 1708 Termon Ave., Brighton Heights, $210,000. Omg we’ve hit the motherlode of weirdness here — this place looks buttoned-up and stately on the outside, but check out the purple room. We’ve got leopard-print curtains, psychedelic brain-wave art, a purple couch, and a rug with a giant cigarette that also seems to be planet Earth. Thank you, dark gods of Zillow. Thank you, Brighton Heights. I will treasure this listing forever. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 7147 Harrison Ave. For rent: 7147 Harrison Ave., Swisshelm Park, $1,350/month. This ad touts the proximity of Parisi Coffee Shop, Rocco’s Tavern, and Pub in the Park. I’ve never heard of any of those places — and yet, I’m pretty much sold. One thing I like more than coffee shops and dive bars is coffee shops and dive bars that I haven’t been to yet. This place is run by Arkham Realty, which might be a Batman reference. I’ve certainly lived in places for dumber reasons than that. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 22 Young St. For sale: 22 Young St., Garfield, $199,900. I’ve spent a lot of time in Garfield in recent years because my son’s school is there, and this is a place that has undeniably changed. I’ve seen houses that have been abandoned for years get fixed up and seemingly inhabited by actual people (and not flippers). But that’s just an outsider’s view, so I really have no idea. If you want cheap, weird little houses, there are still a few like this out there, though. Why does this house, built in 1900, have three upstairs windows of different sizes, in descending order? I also have no idea. “Young Street Garfield” would make a great 2010s Soundcloud mumble-rapper alias, in case anyone needs that. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 5007 Blair St. For rent: 5007 Blair St., Hazelwood, $1,250/month. Look at too many houses, and you start to anthropomorphize them a little, seeing faces, even expressions, in windows and doors. This rowhouse isn’t jumping on the mustache bandwagon; it’s been sporting the old soup-strainer since Mike Ditka was catching passes in Aliquippa. Inside, everything is bright and white and clean, which is less fun, but will probably help get this place rented. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 343 Conniston St. For sale: 343 Conniston St., Bon Air, $150,000. After saving the world from fascism, a generation returned from World War II and decided that the time-honored principles of home building were no good anymore, so let’s build houses as receptacles for cars, instead of people. And yet, I have a lot of nostalgia for homes like these, because they look a lot like the one my grandpa built by hand in O’Hara. Hey, it was cheaper and probably a great way to relax after a long day hammering molten metal in the blacksmith’s forge. And there was still some vestigial craftsmanship left; solid little brick houses like this one are still rock-solid and clearly built for a harder, less comfortable world. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 1415 Lager St. For rent: 1415 Lager St., Troy Hill, $950/month. Lager Street. Well, Troy Hill was a German neighborhood for a long time, and where there were Germans there were breweries, and, hey, you can walk to Penn Brewery from here (which specializes in German food and lagers). So, yeah, all that and central air for under $1,000/month. Troy Hill is also pretty quiet and has incredible views.

Carson St. Oh, hey, look, someone solved the housing crisis: “Austin Rents Tumble 220% from Peak on Massive Home Building Spree.” Sure, there might be other things that help at the margins, and other things worth doing. But if you want a metro-sized solution to a very big problem, this is all there is: you’ve got to build housing. Since this column is almost entirely about the weird little old houses of Pittsburgh, you may assume I’m in the “never change anything” camp — that I’m holding out hope that the steel mills are going to reopen someday, Chuck Noll will be reincarnated, and order will be restored to the universe. Not happening! The only thing we can say about the future is that it won’t be much like the past. For the record, I think we can have a growing, thriving city AND a city that preserves most of the good things about it — especially those weird little old houses. In fact, you can’t have the latter without the former. Someone has to live in those houses, and Pittsburgh old-timers are dying out (or retiring to Myrtle Beach). Lots of new houses/apartments decreases the upward pressure on prices in our existing housing stock. Pittsburgh needs new people and they need places to live (all kinds, not just old houses). Not that being more like Austin should be the goal — that city seems like a different beast than Pittsburgh (to be fair, I’ve never even been there!). But when a city growing as fast as Austin has managed to bring average rents back down to $1,399/month, it’s time to pay attention. For rent: Residences at South High, 930 E. Carson St., South Side, $1,280-2,100/month. “Experience Carefree Living Just Like Your School Days!” Ha (Tim Robinson “You sure about that? gif goes here). My school days were anything but carefree, and I have no desire to live in my old high school. But it was a hideous 1970s concrete bunker and not a turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts beauty like the old South Side High School. These kinds of schools make good-quality housing — if a bit tricky and capital-intensive to redevelop — and Pittsburgh is really developing some expertise in the field. Just make sure you get a hall pass when you go out back to clap the erasers. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Helm on the Allegheny, 2239 Railroad St. For rent: Helm on the Allegheny, 2239 Railroad St., Strip District, $1,023-$2,681/month. The Strip District is the perfect place to put transplants because hardly anyone has lived here until very recently (and, well, the 1800s), so there’s no one to displace. River views, transit connections, incredible walkability, amazing groceries and restaurants — need I go on? And yet … we are at peak ugly apartment, and it doesn’t have to be this way. Helm on the Allegheny is far from the worst offender (that would be the Arsenal apartments in Lawrenceville) – and at least one side of this building looks OK, but unless you’re on a coal barge, you probably won’t see it. This has a nice density, good prices, even a creative approach to a slim sliver of a site, with those serrated balconies facing the water. But it doesn’t matter how many colors and shapes of corrugated metal siding you slap on, it’s always going to look like a shipping container. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 22 Edith Pl. For sale: 22 Edith Pl., South Oakland, $145,000. Follow the yellow-brick homes to South Oakland! Not a lot for sale here, but it’s nice to see this old working-class neighborhood still has some of the old prices. Maybe it’s the proximity of like 50,000 students who tend to tend to keep property values low. Now, nobody’s saying college kids are bad neighbors, but there’s a reason nobody wants to live in the dorms after a year or so — even college kids want to get away from college kids. But if you’re not bothered by the usual nuisances — the smell of weed, pizza boxes, yelling at 3 a.m. — the price is certainly pretty good. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 311 Birmingham Ave. For sale: 311 Birmingham Ave., Carrick, $149,000. This just dropped $20,000 in the past month, which is a lot for a house that was listed for less than 200K to begin with. Carrick has its problems, but this is a really nice yellow-brick Victorian in good shape for old-Pittsburgh prices, which exist in fewer and fewer places every year. (Though, to be fair, they are still plentiful in further-out places like the Mon Valley and Beaver County.) But nothing stays the same; Carrick’s day could be around the corner if the city ever booms again. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 3331 Milwaukee St. For sale: 3331 Milwaukee St., Polish Hill, $199,000. There used to be a Pittsburgh alt-country band called The Polish Hillbillies, and they were way better than that name would suggest. I Googled them recently to see if there were any extant recordings and all I got was an obituary and a Michigan travel agency with that name, which is pretty sad. This hillside enclave still has a little Polish flavor, but I wish there was more; you should literally be greeted with a steaming plate of pierogies if you manage to walk all the way up from the Strip District. This 1930 house, recessed back a little from the street, is in solid shape and seems to have recently acquired a nice coat of white paint. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Beechwood Gardens, 3245 Beechwood Blvd. For rent: Beechwood Gardens, 3245 Beechwood Blvd., Squirrel Hill, $975/month. Squirrel Hill has a lot of things going for it, that I probably don’t need to enumerate further here. However, one thing that’s worth pointing out again is that there are still some cheap rentals in Squirrel Hill, like Beechwood Gardens. Despite being nothing special in themselves — though one side will have some amazing views over the Mon Valley — these apartments put you within three miles of the universities and a good chunk of the region’s jobs and best places to eat (try Taiwanese Bistro 33, Everyday Noodles, and Amazing Dumplings, for starters).

Now, I want to be able to walk to a grocery store, and a commute that doesn’t involve tunnels. Oh, and neighbors who don’t cook meth and throw trash in the street. See the overlap there? It’s pretty thin, and you have to squint a bit — but it’s walkability. Otherwise, younger-me and current-me don’t really want too many of same things. Luckily, I found a place that met the former criteria and somehow meets the latter as well. The point is that making long-term decisions like buying a house is kind of absurd, and basically just a guess. You could try to imagine what middle-aged-you (or elderly you) wants in a place, but that’s probably not going to work. Picking an apartment that’s close to work is a good idea. But I wouldn’t buy a house based on that. Minimizing your commute is good, but when you’re thinking in terms of decades, you probably won’t stay at that job (or any job) nearly as long. That goes the same for individual businesses. Luckily, the record store I love is still there, but one of the movie theaters and ALL of the bars and restaurants except one or two are gone. Sometimes, I will recommend a house because I like something nearby, like a grocery store. But mostly, it’s because I get bored talking about carpet colors and backsplashes. More than once, I’ve extolled the virtues of Salem’s Market in the Hill District, which I think is the best grocery store in Pittsburgh. Or it was. Now, who knows? It only lasted about a year, and it’s still unknown if it will come back. Your neighborhood is going to change, and change again, and then change some more, whether you want it to or not. Some of those changes you’re going to hate. Some will be OK, and a few might even be for the better. So, just pick a place that gets the job done right now and worry about the future when it arrives. For sale: 5850 Centre Ave., Shadyside, $265,000. When his place was built in 1890 (!), the word “condo” didn’t exist, and each room probably housed a family of 12, a baseball team, a chimney sweep guild, and a horse or two. So, I’m going to reserve judgment on the dated cabinetry, the bathroom tile, and basically any of the tiny details. Pretty much the only constant is that Shadyside is still a good place to live, with 100% more grad students and 100% fewer robber barons, live-in maids, and butlers. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 308 Saline St. For rent: 308 Saline St., Greenfield, $890/month. Four Mile Run is one of my favorite weird sub-neighborhoods of one of my favorite neighborhoods, Greenfield. You’re in a valley, with steep ravines on several sides, and a bridge looming above— yet you’re a short walk along the trail from the heart of Oakland. Of course, routine walks will probably seem like Everest expeditions until you get used to the hills. And it’s not just cardio — you’ll be lifting heavy weights up those hills too (i.e. yourself, after eating at Big Jim’s in the Run). Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 1620 Concordia St. For sale: 1620 Concordia St., Carrick, $132,000. This house, built in 1903, has seen some things. (That’s why it’s kind of squinting at you with windows of mismatched shapes). Back then, Pittsburgh had zero cars, airports, and Super Bowl victories — because none of those things existed yet. And yet, this sturdy little house has somehow stood the test of time and doesn’t look worse for wear. In fact, it’s probably thrilled to not have corrosive, industrial-grade soot dumped on it every day from the steel mills, now long gone. I see you, little white house in Carrick. You did good. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 5525 Covode St. For rent: 5525 Covode St., Squirrel Hill, $995-1,325/month. Two pictures, two colors of brick (red and cream); is this the same building? I can’t tell from the street, and certainly there are weirder iterations of this issue all over Pittsburgh. Does it matter? Probably not. The cobblestoned streets in Squirrel Hill look great, but are hell on your car, but the brick streets like this one seem to be a happy medium between the two. Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 515 N. Beatty St. For sale: 515 N. Beatty St., East Liberty, $267,100. The price cuts have even come for East Liberty, including an $8,000 drop here. For years, the trend towards skyrocketing prices would continue to the point where only tech oligarchs and first-round draft picks could buy in. See how hard it is to predict the future? However, this house is way closer to the exception than the rule, and any drops in price are probably more of a temporary blip than a long-term trend. Multiple queasy shades of green trim probably don’t help, though. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Ruth Gardens, 5726 Beacon St. For rent: Ruth Gardens, 5726 Beacon St., Squirrel Hill, $1,250-1,325/month. Ruth Gardens looks like it belongs on some leafy East Coast college that is terrible at football, but that’s not a bad thing. Sure, the radiator probably makes a weird noise and there’s a non-zero chance your upstairs neighbor has kids who love to roller-skate on those beautiful hardwood floors, but that kind of charm would cost you extra in many cities.

If someone created a list of the most renter-friendly cities in America, would Pittsburgh be on it? Well, someone did. Actually, two separate surveys, Apartment Advisor and RentCafe both made that conclusion, arriving at it via different methodologies. The first has Pittsburgh #8 in “The Most Renter-Friendly Cities in 2024” and “Best Places for Renters to Live in 2024” has us #2 in the Northeast (though #73 nationwide). The first devised a formula based on “vacancy rates, demand, new residential construction, and tenant protection laws” as well as “desirability, based on public transit and entertainment, and economic opportunity for renters in each city, analyzing the median income–to–median rent ratio, unemployment rates, and rental property price trends.” The second took on 20 separate criteria; this combined metric seems to really like Southern cities more than Northeastern ones. Of course, it certainly doesn’t feel like a paradise for renters around here, but we probably rely on vibes enough as it is. Maybe the numbers say something different, if they can be relied upon (always an open question). What to make of this? Probably nothing. It does seem at least somewhat believable — but only because renting is such a hellish ordeal in most other places. It’s kind of like how the Pirates still have a plausible playoffs window, because the rest of the National League sucks so bad. NORTH SIDE For sale: 965 Stanford Rd., Woods Run, $219,000 Look, I’m not getting paid under the table in schnitzel from Max’s Allegheny Tavern to promote the North Side. I actually think it’s an interesting place that gets a bad rap for some good reasons and a lot of bad ones. It’s also one of only a handful of places where ample sub-$250K homes exist without glaring issues. This 1926 house has a really comfortable front porch with a fabric awning instead of a creaky metal one, a functioning fireplace (pretty rare in the city), and a recent, contemporary paint job for just about every room. Something similar is going to cost you way more in the East End, which is going to put you farther away from the schnitzel. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 1211 Buena Vista St., Apt. 2 For rent: 1211 Buena Vista St., Apt. 2. Mexican War Streets, $1,250/month A historic home for rent in the Mexican War Streets with 100-year-old woodwork and stained glass — and even a porch swing? Maybe in the heyday of Olde Allegheny City these kinds of places were a dime a dozen, but not today. Maybe this is all the evidence needed for Pittsburgh to be considered a great place for renting. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 2350 Allender Ave. WEST END For sale: 2350 Allender Ave., Banksville, $275,000 They’re calling this “a farmhouse in the city” which seems like a case of country-fried cosplay that even Kenny Chesney fans would find dubious. But it comes with a half-acre of land, a giant porch, a back patio, and even a gazebo. No big red barn, no chickens, no Old MacDonald, unless he’s sitting at end of the bar with a theory why we can’t just draft decent inside linebackers anymore. But there’s historic (1916) charm to be had, including truly nice hardwood floors, some landscaping, and a new cedar butcher block island in the kitchen. If you still require chickens, well, there’s always the deli at Giant Eagle. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 221 Sterrett St. For rent: 221 Sterrett St., Westwood, $700/month The only things I know about Westwood are Antney’s Ice Cream (Pittsburgh’s best) and that their Little League teams are not to be taken lightly. However, $700 rents (for one bedroom) are still enough of a rarity nowadays that you have to wonder why. Honestly, perhaps that savings is going straight to Antney’s, so maybe it’s not really that cheap after all. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 2438 Edgebrook Ave. SOUTH For sale: 2438 Edgebrook Ave., Brookline, $175,000 I prefer ranch dressing to ranch houses (who doesn’t), but sometimes you want (or need) most things on one floor, and the supply of those homes is limited in the city. Brookline always seems so undervalued compared to other comparable city neighborhoods, which seems suspicious; is there some kind of highly localized crime wave here that nobody is talking about? (Grandmas selling bootleg root beer barrels out of an Iron City ashtray? Grand theft pierogie?) click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Fieldbrook Apartments, 1425 McFarland Rd. For rent: Fieldbrook Apartments, 1425 McFarland Rd., Mt. Lebanon, $960/month For a long time, it seemed like the sheer difficulty of getting to Pittsburgh’s nearby South Hills neighborhoods from anywhere else was a problem. But what if it’s an advantage? Dormont, which this complex is just on the edge of, has two main business districts that have thrived in spite of bridges and tunnels; maybe that’s what’s keeping these neighborhoods unique and differentiated from directions north and east. At any rate, any rentals under $1,000 that feature four upright walls seem like a victory nowadays, and in a walkable neighborhood with great places to eat like the Dor-Stop and Moonlit Burgers nearby, no less.

A beautiful depiction of the Pittsburgh skyline and our famous golden bridges. To know Pittsburgh is to love it, whether you want to or not, because once you enter its magnetic field, it never lets you go. It doesn't matter if you were born here and never left, boomeranged back, or moved here from New Castle or New York, this city will embrace you, but only if you act right, and the same rules apply to all of us. Many will succeed, some will falter. Here are the 13 types of people who might need to work a little harder to earn their yinzer stripes. People who thought this was a big city When I first moved to Pittsburgh from Austin, Texas — at the time, a mid-sized, one-degree-of-separation type city — I kept asking questions that raised eyebrows. Where’s the 24-hour coffee shop? How do I pick up bins for weekly recycling and compost? (“Go to Home Depot,” a 311 responder told me.) Where can we grab dinner on a Monday? After a few weeks, friends who hailed from even bigger cities took pity on me, quietly pulled me aside, and gave me the Pittsburgh equivalent of Ned Beatty’s Network speech: This is not a big city. Don’t try to make it anything other than what it is. If Austin had one degree of separation, Pittsburgh had no degrees, and I shouldn’t expect much after 9 p.m. — something true to this day. Of course, once you shed expectations, Pittsburgh is endlessly charming, and punches far above its weight in terms of big-city amenities. Now I’m the converted, preaching: Food! Parks! Five universities, three pro sports teams, a world-class symphony and museums! Embrace the city on its own terms and it will embrace you – even though I’d still love that all-night coffee shop. -Rachel Wilkinson click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham The former Heinz Field scoreboard featuring its iconic ketchup bottles People who like changeOnce upon a time there was a place called Starlake Amphitheatre. It was purchased and renamed a few times over the years, but no one cared, and everyone still called it Starlake. Now, it’s called Starlake once again because in Pittsburgh, we do not accept change. Apparently Heinz Field is now called something else, but I’ve never heard a single local use the new name. Sheryl Crow once told us “I think a change would do you good.” She was wrong. If you don’t think so, you’re probably not going to fit in very well here. -Ali Trachta click to enlarge People who don't want to live in community with deer We live in Pittsburgh, my dear, and the deer are here to stay. With milder winters and plenty to eat, there are considerably more of them grazing in our yards than ever. And they’re not afraid to turn your roses, lilies, and hostas into an all-you-can-eat buffet. See how they look at you through your sliding glass window? Yeah, they don’t care. Are there more deer poops in your yard than you can count? It happens to all of us. And during rut, they might just kamikaze right onto 279 during rush hour. They’ll ruin your Subaru just as fast as they ruined your hydrangeas. Between 2004 and 2023, the number of deer carcasses picked up by Animal Care and Control spiked from 140 to a stark 575 in just two decades — a 411% increase. And unless Pittsburgh continually expands its archery and sharpshoot programs, that number will keep going up. My advice? Embrace them. (Not literally because this isn’t Disney; they’re wild animals.) Learn to live with their presence, because they’re not going anywhere. -Stacy Rounds People who like driving on a gridI remember the exact date Google Maps released turn-by-turn voice commands, because without them, I’d be dead. You take someone who already lacks a sense of direction and drop them onto the Fort Pitt tunnel in their first 48 hours in Pittsburgh — it’s by god’s grace I’m still here. Driving in the East End, I actually recall thinking, “I’ll just figure it out. Surely the streets are numbered?” (Yes and no!) If you, too, relied on a grid, or any discernible traffic patterns, to drive, you won’t make it in Pittsburgh without cultivating a sense of adventure (or without my other method: taking public transit). Can you drive home using the same route you came? No! If you miss your exit, can you simply get off the highway and turn around on the access road? Not always! It’s a fun game. Maybe you wind up accidentally crossing a bridge and then going on a construction detour! Of course, I’ve acclimated by now, but don’t think that I don’t notice every time I make a right turn — yes, a 90-degree perpendicular turn — to stay on Bigelow Blvd. Take a breath because it’s all part of the adventure. -RW click to enlarge CP Photo: Mars Johnson Fans participate in the seventh inning stretch at PNC Park. People who say “sportsball”Pittsburgh is a sports town, period. Not only does this city love to celebrate and/or complain about its three (arguably four) major teams, ascendant minor-league teams, and many college programs, but locals’ knowledge of these teams goes deep. If you say “sportsball” or make the mistake of feigning knowledge of sports in a Pittsburgh dive bar, get ready for a ribbing. Don’t wade in with opinions if you aren’t willing to defend them. One tip: ask the questions you have. You’re as likely to get a great primer on the mechanics of an offensive line as you are a lengthy, nostalgic story about the time your barstool neighbor saw Roberto Clemente at Forbes Field. People have internalized the names and stats of dead Pirates, washed Steelers, and pre-Lemieux Penguins. The city shows up in force for its teams — familiarizing yourself with the Steelers’ home schedule at a minimum can help you avoid sitting in traffic for 45 minutes on a Sunday. -Colin Williams People who come from a flat cityI went to college in Wisconsin — a flat-ass place. In the middle of the university’s flat-ass campus was this one hill, called Bascom Hill, and when I tell you everyone bitched about having to shlep up that thing on the way to class, truly, Pittsburghers, you wouldn’t believe. This thing is a lovely slope. It’s a nice little incline. It’s not Negley Ave. or, heaven forbid, Rialto St., but these cornfield-born midwesterners just could not handle it. So, plains people, just be aware that if you move here, there are Bascoms all over the place, and you’re going to need to engage your glutes a bit when you walk around. That’s just the way it is. -AT People who aren’t down to cry at Arby’s Having a good cry at the Arby’s on McKnight Rd. is a time-honored tradition for North Hills residents and for nonresidents braving the construction traffic to shop at Ross Park Mall. If you need a place to pull over, order some curly fries, and let it all out, this is the best place to cry in Pittsburgh. Why is Arby’s the best place to cry? Why not? Maybe you’re having a rough day, maybe you’re forlorn over your relationship, or maybe your eyes were too big for your stomach and you can’t finish your 5 for $5. From a notorious missed connection to a horror story about a day that they didn’t have the meats, this particular Arby’s is a genuinely unhappy place. It’s no wonder people flock there to let their tears flow like Sprite from a fountain. If you’re going to cry in public, it might as well be someplace that’s just a little sad by nature, am I right? -SR People who eat Hunts Ketchup GTFO. -AT People who aren’t handy Pittsburgh’s four seasons are rough on homes and cars. If you’ve never picked up a screwdriver or you resort to buying your friends six-packs to get that IKEA furniture built, get ready for a lot of bills from contractors and mechanics. The culprit in the ’Burgh is almost always water. It finds cracks in our century-old houses, freezes and destroys our roads, and occasionally accumulates in local floods that damage homes and businesses. You can save yourself endless hassles and a good bit of money with even basic handiness. Cleaning your gutters, knowing basic plumbing and wiring, and keeping your tires appropriately filled and your fluids topped off will stave off 90% of those emergencies. It can also help to know your neighbors — lots of longtime residents have untold quantities of tools in their basements and garages and can help you with a quick repair or a brake job if you keep things friendly. -CW click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of The Fred Rogers Company Fred Rogers of Mister Roger's Neighborhood People who think Mister Rogers is creepy If you want to piss off Pittsburgh, talk shit about Mister Rogers. The man is a saint, he’s ours, and he was one of the few people to grace this earth who wholly embodied the human capacity for good. Calling him “creepy” is a surefire way to stop a conversation in its tracks. There are Steel City residents who would throw hands for the empathetic puppeteer, who remains a beloved childhood institution even as Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood spinoffs grow their own popular following. Save the scoffing for actual perverts, capisce? -CW People who are weird about running into their exesIf I had a nickel for every time I said “Pittsburgh is so very small” I’d be hauling barrels full of five-cent pieces to the nearest Coinstar. In this town, no one is a new acquaintance, and most likely, you share a mutual friend or former employer, or, for years, have been passing each other like ships in the night at every bar, supermarket, and music venue within a 10-mile radius. The sentiment especially applies to the city’s dating scene, and if you’re one to hold grudges, your Pittsburgh social life is all but doomed. If you’re not willing to accept that the person who stiffed you on rent before dumping your ass might also be serving you a latte at your local coffee shop, walking their dog in the same parklet, or browsing in the same aisle at Market District, then you might as well relocate. If you both frequented the same haunt, odds are that, post break-up, they will be there, waiting to ruin your night. If you share mutual friends, they will be at your bestie’s housewarming party with their new squeeze, whether you like it or not. Yes, it would be wonderful if a break-up meant that the person who presumably wronged you would disappear into another dimension, never to be seen again. But that’s not reality. To survive in Pittsburgh, you can’t let your romantic terrorists win. -Amanda Waltz click to enlarge Photo courtesy of Redfin 1320 W. Sycamore St. in Duquesne Heights People who can’t parallel park I’ve lived and driven in a handful of other major cities and let me tell you, when it comes to parking, Pittsburgh is the wild west; a lawless land. If there’s a teensy bit of space on the side of the road, and you can fit there, you’re going to, signs and rules be damned. So if you’re going to make it here, you need to be crafty with that steering wheel, especially considering that, half the time, you’re going to be maneuvering on a hill, possibly in the snow, possibly in heels, possibly on the left-hand side of the street, possibly in a beat up old Pontiac. But don’t worry, you got this! You’d better, anyway. -AT People who want privacy from their neighbors Neighborliness is a key Pittsburgh trait, but so is nebbiness. If your highest priority is privacy, you might consider moving to the exurbs instead. Within the city itself, rowhouse architecture lends itself to tight-knit communities, but even more suburban Pittsburgh neighborhoods have their share of altruists and busybodies who make it a point to know the folks on their street as well as they can. It’s a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you’ve got a dozen potential pet-sitters; on the other, everyone knows how late you came home last night. Writ large, though, it’s these strong community bonds that make Pittsburgh what it is and give us our distinct Appalachian blend of east coast spice and heartland openness. -CW Update: Check us out on City Cast discussing the 13 people here: Slideshow Pittsburgh's First Winter Storm of 2025 Click to View 16 slides Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Stay Weird, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Yinzer, Mr. Rogers Related Content Will 2025 be Gen Z's best year yet in Pittsburgh?

By Rachel Wilkinson click to enlarge CP Photo: Pat Cavanagh Commuting into Downtown on Second Ave., my route takes me down Court Place. The street is a short, narrow one-way that crosses Ross and Grant Streets and requires a kind of zigzag maneuver around the Boulevard of the Allies on-ramp — which it abuts — to stay going west-ish. But for me the most bizarre part is getting a glimpse of the back of an eagle statue perched atop a stone pillar. The eagle is part of a pair of World War I era statues that greet the Boulevard's traffic, which, driving up Court Pl., goes above your head and in the opposite direction. I try not to let seeing the eagle's back throw me every time I go Downtown, panicking I've somehow gone the wrong way. Heading back home toward Ross St. of course requires taking a different route on an equally short, narrow one-way street (which is apparently still Second on that side). But that way, you get to take in the full view of the eagle, while also doing a weird jog around Firstside Park, not visible from the other direction. Pittsburgh driving having its foibles is well-worn territory. I recently touched on this when Pittsburgh City Paper called out the 13 types of people who ain’t gonna make it in Pittsburgh, which for my part was largely confessional. I grew up driving mostly on a grid and mostly navigating stretches of big Texas highways, which, unlike the defensive driving required in Pittsburgh, you can do on auto-pilot after a certain level of familiarity. That said, I’ve always had a poor sense of direction. It’s likely an inherited trait from my father and grandfather, and it can quickly cross from being a funny quirk into an embarrassing impairment (and into the realm of “neurospiciness” as the kids say). Teaching me to drive in a pre-GPS world, my dad shared all his strategies for coping: highways will tell you what cardinal direction you’re going. Street numbers increase as you move south to north. You can reliably make two right turns to turn around. Use landmarks (like eagle statues). And most importantly, words of comfort: if you made it there, you can make it home, because you can always drive back the same way you came. Obviously, these comforting principles quickly fall apart in Pittsburgh, and as I've said before, it’s by god’s grace I’m still here. When my parents visited me for the first time, I remember them asking with some dread, “Why can’t we take the same route there and back?” Of course, in genuinely answering this question, the usual suspects are to blame. First is Pittsburgh’s topography. A traditional street grid that would allow similar return routes only works up to a point when mapped onto steep hills and river valleys. I still remember Olga George, press secretary for Mayor Ed Gainey, describing Pittsburgh as a “city of mountains” during a visit to City Paper. (We live a mountain town!) Add our topography to the city of Pittsburgh’s historically piecemeal expansion, which was less the result of central planning and instead annexing former boroughs and municipalities, many before cars existed. After residential clusters formed around geographic features, neighborhoods separated along railroad tracks or ethnic groups, with the city's ward bosses negotiating for specific roads and parks. The groundwork for a hodgepodge road system was laid long before the 90 neighborhoods we know were officially (and inexactly) created. Even the region’s parkways built in the 1950s and ‘60s aren’t really built like modern interstate highways, which tend to link up with a city grid and are used less for short local hops. Instead, we have oddities like Boulevard of the Allies, which is somehow a freeway and a local road — and was plopped down amidst the city’s existing streetcar lines. Different eras of urban redevelopment also keep confounding what could be simpler routes. Ironically, Court Place is a remnant of Renaissance II in the 1980s, and was reconfigured to simplify Downtown traffic patterns. This is all to underscore a lesson I learned early. It's not just that driving in Pittsburgh isn’t for the faint of heart (still true), but rather that to make it here, you have to shed old strategies and learn to embrace the adventure. For me that means waving to the weirdo eagle in the one direction I get to see it. It's not a reliable landmark for navigating, but it has to come symbolize something about the city's nature for me. In Pittsburgh, you can go home again, just not the same way.

Legend has it the cemetery is home to an apparition locals affectionally call Walkin’ Rosie, a woman in a flowing white dress who likes to wander after dark. Another story goes that Rosie can be summoned by shining a light on her gravestone, and photos taken at the site reveal “unidentified orbs.” But during Kelly’s first investigation in 2006, he encountered something else all together. “We just started walking the cemetery and snapping pictures,” he remembers. “We got home the next day, and I was looking at them, and on the road, no lie, floating in the air … was an [orange orb] that looked like a pissed-off Smiley Cookie. No lie, it was so orange, and it looked angry.\" Kelly had just returned from a ghost walk of the Gettysburg battlefield, still considered one of the most haunted places in America. “I was hooked right away,” he says, and that orange Smiley Cookie orb kicked off a nearly 20-year stint leading paranormal investigations. Meeting with friends, fittingly enough, at Eat’n Park, Kelly founded the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society, one of the first groups of its kind in the region. Because it was 2006, they put out a call for members on Meetup.com. The group soon got enough interest to investigate Blue Mist Road, which Kelly still identifies as Pittsburgh’s “most haunted area.” “I don't believe in the word scary, but it became very uncomfortable,” he says. “And we got a lot of orb[s] that night.” click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Pittsburgh Paranormal Society Photo from paranormal investigation near Molnar's Marina in Monongahela, Pa., 2019. Pittsburgh City Paper recently spoke with Kelly about the city’s many haunted restaurants and the National Aviary, where he led one of only two paranormal groups invited to investigate. Listening to Kelly’s experiences, I had to learn more about the group’s history before the heyday of paranormal TV shows, and how they investigated the region’s spookiest sites, some of which are inaccessible today. The first thing to know about 2000s-era ghosting hunting, Kelly says, is there wasn’t a widespread cultural understanding of it. Ideas about trauma or “negative energy” being stored at a location weren’t mainstream, he tells City Paper, “unless you were in the metaphysical field [or] you were a witch or a Wiccan.” In the beginning, Kelly and about 10 Paranormal Society members made mostly house calls. Residents then did not want to coexist with ghosts, Kelly says — influenced by possession movies like The Exorcist — and saw the group as providing a needed service to resolve hauntings. “My group alone did more private residence[s] than any other group in Pittsburgh,” he says. A spooked homeowner would reach out to Kelly by email, reporting what they’d seen: rearranged furniture, objects flying, unexplained shadows, “things falling apart.” “Believe it or not, I never really advertised. Everything was done by word of mouth,” Kelly says. The Society also never charged for its services. “All I asked was… maybe [can we] have coffee and some doughnuts and some unsweetened iced tea.” The Paranormal Society would do a walk-through before conducting a full investigation, logging two to three each week. The team set up a camcorder, made the room “pitch black,” and spoke to specters with a K2 meter (or EMF reader) in hand. The device detects spikes in the electromagnetic field said to indicate the presence of ghosts and was “the most important piece of equipment we had back then, and even today,” Kelly says. “Spirit is pure energy,” he explains. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Pittsburgh Paranormal Society Shawn Kelly at Eat'n Park with the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society. Kelly headed up the “spiritual side” of the team who worked in tandem with the “scientific side” or “techies,” as Kelly calls the latter. He also remembers the group using a four-megapixel digital camera to catch anything not readily visible, like floating orbs, and that members were floored when a 12-megapixel camera was released — “oh my god, that was the top of the line.” They met up at Eat’n Park most Sunday nights to pore over photos. Sometimes, he says, the group found nothing, but still tried to treat each client with consideration. Frequent investigation requests came from houses built near the Bushy Run Battlefield in Westmoreland County, whose location is believed to create spillover between worlds (something even acknowledged on the battlefield’s website). click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Pittsburgh Paranormal Society Photo from paranormal investigation at private row house in East McKeesport, Pa. Similarly, the Monongahela Valley region remains “the most haunted place in the state of Pennsylvania,” Kelly says. Walking the Great Allegheny Passage starting from the Boston trailhead in McKeesport, “you could actually see spirits carrying lanterns” or “a bunch of shadow figures.” By 2008, the Paranormal Society had investigated more than 100 cases, and Kelly spoke with CP. He says the interview helped the group take off further, and they gained access to the Point Park University Pittsburgh Playhouse — where the university now has a webpage dedicated to the theater’s hauntings, including another Lady in White. Their caseload expanded to include haunted businesses, hotels, and marinas. Kelly helped friends at a Monongahela funeral home, and at Molnar’s Lounge, a bar and grill in Elizabeth. Tim's Secret Treasures, a Charleroi antique store, reported hearing disembodied whispers and footsteps and seeing moving furniture. After Kelly’s investigations, the shop ultimately landed on a ghost hunting show on the Biography Channel in 2012, which explored the building’s history as a former funeral parlor, scrap yard, and speakeasy. Throughout all this, Kelly worked as a meat cutter, staying out at investigations until 2 or 3 a.m., then showing up to his day job five hours later. Now in his 60s, he says eventually “it took a toll.” In addition, when he started out, Ghost Hunters (starring the still-popular The Atlantic Paranormal Society or TAPS) had premiered less than two years prior. The show blew up, spawned imitators, and changed the nature of the hobby. “The fad wore out,” he tells CP. Today, retired from the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society, Kelly still works with local paranormal groups including Bump in the Night Society. But the model for running a paranormal group has changed: most charge money to go on investigations, visit historic places more than they cleanse homes, and, in Kelly’s opinion, often bring too many people along to conduct a true investigation. “I’m old school,” he says. Evolving with the times, he now devotes his energy to a paranormal-themed podcast, Into The Night, which you can catch Tuesday and Sunday nights on United Public Radio in New Orleans. For those wanting to go an old-fashioned ghost hunt, Kelly offers some suggestions. In the city, Greenfield’s Calvary Cemetery remains a hotspot, and just across a bridge, the Carnegie Library of Homestead (which sometimes leads ghost tours). click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Pittsburgh Paranormal Society Photo from paranormal investigation at Grove Cemetery in New Brighton, Pa. In Beaver County, Kelly and the Paranormal Society picked up evidence of ghosts at Grove Cemetery in New Brighton — and you simply can’t go wrong in the Mon Valley, where you can sometimes glimpse ghosts walking the streets, he says. Kelly also asserts it’s a common misconception that witching hours run midnight to 3 a.m. In his experience, most activity takes place earlier, from 10 p.m. to 1a.m. Spirits aren’t so different from us, he explains, and are sensitive to our rhythms. “People are starting to settle down,” Kelly says. “You know how you're running around all day long, but around 10 p.m. everybody starts to relax? That's when they decide to come out.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Stay Weird, Pittsburgh Latest in Stay Weird, Pittsburgh In Pittsburgh, why do we never seem to drive the same route there and back?

By Stacy Rounds click to enlarge CP Photo: Stacy Rounds I squatted on Forbes Ave. on Monday, Aug. 16, 2024, to take a photo of this sprinkled specimen. I wasn’t expecting to nearly step in bedazzled dog doo on my way to Le Gourmandine. It was a bizarre sight: nearly fresh canine excrement with little flags donning the phrases “TRUMP DUMP” and “Trumpin’ ‘n Dumpin” stuck into the turds with toothpicks and topped with patriotic sprinkles. So many questions. Of course, I took a picture of this curiosity (that must have been a sight) and shared it with our crew here at Pittsburgh City Paper. Apparently, two other staff members have seen the work of this mystery poopy protester before. The turd tagger in question is working the Downtown and North Side bowel movement beat, since their work has been spotted by our crew and others on Forbes Ave. and Smithfield St. (this past Monday), Fourth Ave. and Smithfield, at Acrisure Stadium, and on the Ft. Duquesne pedestrian bridge. I can’t help but wonder about the scat signer’s methods. Is this person carrying around these carefully constructed mini flags and red-white-and-blue-stars sprinkles in their pants pockets, purse, fanny pack, backpack, briefcase (could you imagine?), or messenger bag just waiting for the perfect subject of fecal matter to present itself? Is this a protest of Trump or a celebration of him (we think protest)? Is this person trying to bring awareness to pet owners and city workers to pick up the poop? Or are they simply trying to make sidewalks great again? But more importantly, we need to know who the fecal flagger is. This bowel movement Banksy was posted on Reddit’s r/pittsburgh channel over a year ago, but nobody has come forward (yet) to claim their work. And we want the scoop.

At various times, it has been referred to as the City of Champions, the City of Bridges, the Steel City, and many other toponyms. It is interesting to explore how these various labels arose and what the justification was for applying them. City of Champions City of Champions is an apt nickname for a city whose professional sports teams have won six Super Bowls, five Stanley Cups, and five World Series and is the home of a university whose teams have won eleven national championships. The Pittsburgh Steelers have played in eight NFL Super Bowls and won six. Only one other NFL team has won six Lombardi trophies, and it is not a city team, but rather a regional one — the New England Patriots. Despite losing the very first World Series in 1903, the Pittsburgh Pirates played in six more, winning five, between 1909 and 1979. The Pittsburgh Penguins, having played in thirty-seven playoff games, six of which were Stanley Cup Finals, have won five Stanley Cups. Pittsburgh is also the only American city where all the professional sports teams wear the same colors — Black and Gold. These are the official colors of Pittsburgh and were on eponymous William Pitt’s coat of arms. City of Bridges Pittsburgh has long been alluded to as “The City of Bridges.” This is quite an appropriate sobriquet when you consider that every road into and out of the city has bridges. Pittsburgh has every type of conventional bridge except for a drawbridge. Pittsburgh bridges also span the entire spectrum of bridge building from ancient Roman stone arch bridges to computer designed bridges. This city of bridges has also contributed significantly to the development of bridge building with Roebling’s wire rope or cable, and the fact that the Fort Pitt Bridge was the first in the world built from computer-aided design. If Pittsburgh is to validly lay claim to the title City of Bridges, it is important to document how many bridges there are in the city. In 2006 book The Bridges of Pittsburgh, I located and documented that there are 446 bridges in the City of Pittsburgh. But numbers alone do not account for the title of “City of Bridges” — equally important is the variety. Pittsburgh has, or has had, pedestrian, automobile, railroad, bus, light rail, water, hot metal, and incline-carrying bridges. It also has or has had covered bridges, wooden bridges, all-steel bridges, toll bridges, and bridges of every style, shape and form. Another aspect is the beauty of the city’s bridges. The Art Commission, established in 1911, evaluates the form and appearance of all bridges costing more than $25,000. Their approval is necessary prior to any bridge construction or reconstruction. One only needs to examine the Portal Bridge leading to Point State Park. Far from being strictly utilitarian, it is a work of art and quite striking when one considers that it supports an interstate highway. Because of the rich variety and number of bridges, bridge engineers have held their annual International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh thirty-four of the forty-one times the conference has been in existence. A highlight is a dinner cruise along the rivers in which the many bridges are visited. The bridge engineers come to Pittsburgh because the city is more than the “City of Bridges”; it is and has been a source of bridge expertise and technology recognized and used throughout the world. Also, as the Steel City, Pittsburgh has provided the material used to build bridges all over the world, in addition to construction material for other historic structures such as the Empire State Building and the Panama Canal. click to enlarge Iron City/Steel City Long before being known as the Steel City, Pittsburgh had been christened the Iron City. In the first half of the nineteenth century, iron producers and manufacturers dominated the city’s landscape. The iron industry started with George Anschutz’s blast furnace (a metallurgical furnace, the name blast coming from its introduction of high-pressure air) in 1793, located in what today is Pittsburgh’s Shadyside neighborhood. Iron occurs naturally. In native iron ore, the iron is combined with oxygen and other impurities. When the native iron ore is heated to 800 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, the oxygen is burned off, and other impurities are removed by further heating and hammering. Thus, the importance of the blast furnace. Although Anschutz’s pioneering efforts failed after a year, the iron industry in Pittsburgh was born and ultimately thrived. By 1815, Pittsburgh was being referred to as the Birmingham of America in reference to the great iron-producing city in England. It was also adorned with the Iron City moniker. Two factors in Pittsburgh’s location contributed significantly to its success in both the iron and steel industries: First is its location at the juncture of three navigable rivers, all basically flowing westward. The second, particularly relevant to iron and steel production, is that Pittsburgh is in the middle of one of the country’s most productive coal fields. Indeed, the original name of Mt. Washington was Coal Hill, and the earliest inclines in the city were built to haul the coal that was so vital to the furnaces used to produce iron and steel. Iron production and manufacturing facilities dominated Pittsburgh industry until 1870. Indeed, the infamous “Hell with the lid off…” quote from an 1868 article by James Parton was referring to the iron production facilities along the Monongahela River (see below). One of the principals in the iron industry was Andrew Carnegie, whose 1872 trip to England led to the conversion of iron production to steel production. Unlike iron, steel is not a naturally occurring substance. It is a metal alloy that must be manufactured. Basically, iron needs to be separated from oxygen with a small amount of carbon added. This is accomplished by mixing iron ore and carbon at a temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. During Carnegie’s 1872 trip to England, he saw the Bessemer steelmaking process, which could readily convert iron ore to steel. Steel is much more durable than iron, and Carnegie readily brought the Bessemer steel making process to the Monongahela valley. Within thirty years, the City of Pittsburgh was producing one-third of the nation’s steel, and in the early 1900s, Pittsburgh became known as the Steel City. It is interesting to wonder that if this change did not occur whether Pittsburgh’ professional football team would have been known as the Ironers. The ’Burgh The ’Burgh is a proper nickname for the City of Pittsburgh, as some locals fought a years-long battle to restore the final H to Pittsburg (an event the city annually celebrates on H Day — July 19). Thus, the city is a “burgh” and not a “burg.” It all began in 1758, when General John Forbes named the city Pittsburgh in honor of William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham and former Prime Minister of England, who had Scottish roots. In Scotland, most towns are pronounced “borough” but are spelled “burgh.” Pittsburgh was chartered in 1816, and the official name was Pittsburgh. However, a typographical error led to its misspelling as Pittsburg on official copies of the charter document. The U.S. Bureau on Geographic Names was established in 1890 and the following year issued thirteen general principles to be used in standardizing place names. Among them was one that decreed that place names ending in burgh should drop the final H and use “burg.” Because of this, the city’s name was changed to Pittsburg. (Editor's note: A 2024 Pittsburgh Magazine story makes the case that the local picture was more complicated.) Although disputed by the city, the Board referred to the copies of the charter document and argued that Pittsburg was always the city’s name. Years of resistance, arguments, and discussions ensued. Ultimately, the original city charter was presented to the Board to validate that the city’s name was Pittsburgh. In July 1911, the Board reversed its decision, and Pittsburg once again became Pittsburgh. Thus, the celebration of July 19 as H-day. This led to Pittsburgh being one of the most misspelled city names in the country, probably because there are only about six other municipalities in the United States whose name ends in -burgh. Gateway to the West The confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers at what is now called the Point is one of the many reasons for the existence of the City of Pittsburgh. At the end of the Revolutionary War, the Ohio River marked the beginning of westward expansion, and, due to its location, Pittsburgh was established as one of the first gateways to the west. This is best illustrated by its being the starting point for the historic 1803 Lewis and Clark expedition. This was only one of many such ventures to the west, which was the outer space of the day. Exploration adventurers, merchants, and settlers all started their westward journey in Pittsburgh. Today, the appellation of Gateway to the West has itself moved westward, as St. Louis with its famous arch now lays claim to that title. click to enlarge CP Photo: Jared Wickerham Pittsburgh Skyline from Mt. Washington Hell With the Lid Off There are three cities readily accessible to the tourist, which are peculiar--Quebec, New Orleans, and Pittsburg — and of these Pittsburg is the most interesting by far. In other towns the can make up his list of lions, do them in a few hours, and go away satisfied; but here all is curious or , environs, history, geology, business, aspect, atmosphere, customs, everything. Pittsburg is a place to read up for, to unpack your trunk and settle down at, to make excursions from, and to study as you would study a group of sciences. To know Pittsburg thoroughly is a liberal education in the kind of culture demanded by modern times.The wonder is, not that Pittsburg is an assemblage of flourishing towns of 230,000 inhabitants, but that, placed at such a commanding point, it is not the flourishing and the populous city in America. might have been the site had been ten level square miles, instead of two, and those two surrounded by steep hills four hundred feet high, and by rivers a third of a mile wide. It is curiously hemmed in--that small triangle of low land upon which the city was originally built. So begins an article by James Parton in the January 1868 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. It is hard to believe that the only quote one hears from this 13,661-word positive article about Pittsburgh is the six-word description of his overview of a nighttime view of the Monongahela River Valley at the height of iron and glass production; to wit, “Hell with the lid taken off.” Some lesser titles Pittsburgh has borne are: River City: The Mon, The Al, and The O have played a vital role in establishing the City and in its flourishing, so that it is only natural that sometimes the city is referred to as River City. The 412: In 1947, area code 412 was established for the City of Pittsburgh. Now, every April 12 is celebrated as 412 Day. The Only City with an Entrance: A 1988 New York Times article described a visitor’s journey from the airport to downtown. It said that, after passing through the Fort Pitt Tunnel, the guest is treated to a stunning view of the city and noted that this is the only city with an entrance. Paris of Appalachia: Pittsburgh is the largest city in the entire Appalachian region and the cultural center of Northern Appalachia. It is also the title of a wonderful 2009 book by Brian O’Neill. Blitzburgh: Mostly uttered by sports fans when one of the professional sports teams, particularly The Steelers, has an outstanding game or season. Bob Regan has written several books on Pittsburgh, including two on Pittsburgh’s city steps and one on the city’s bridges. Although retired from the University of Pittsburgh, he still teaches one course a year.

This super-black coating absorbs 99.96% of visible light, creating a visual void. It has many practical applications, like improving the operation of telescopes, infrared cameras, and solar panels. I propose we make Vantablack your symbol of power in the coming weeks. It will signify that an apparent void or absence in your life might actually be a fertile opportunity. An ostensible emptiness may be full of potential. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Among their many sensational qualities, rivers have the power to create through demolition and revision. Over the centuries, they erode rock and earth, making canyons and valleys. Their slow and steady transformative energy can be an inspiration to you in the coming months, Taurus. You, too, will be able to accomplish wonders through the strength of your relentless persistence—and through your resolute insistence that some old approaches will need to be eliminated to make way for new dispensations. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Centuries before European sailors ventured across the seas, Polynesians were making wide-ranging voyages around the South Pacific. Their navigations didn’t use compasses or sextants, but relied on analyzing ocean swells, star configurations, cloud formations, bird movements, and wind patterns. I bring their genius to your attention, Gemini, because I believe you are gaining access to new ways to read and understand your environment. Subtleties that weren’t previously clear to you are becoming so. Your perceptual powers seem to be growing, and so is your sensitivity to clues from below the visible surface of things. Your intuition is synergizing with your logical mind. CANCER (June 21-July 22): The Maeslant Barrier is a gigantic, movable barricade designed to prevent the flooding of the Dutch port of Rotterdam. It’s deployed when storms generate surges that need to be repelled. I think we all need metaphorical versions of this protective fortification, with its balance of unstinting vigilance and timely flexibility. Do you have such psychic structures in place, Cancerian? Now would be a good time to ensure that you have them and they’re working properly. A key factor, as you mull over the prospect I’m suggesting, is knowing that you don’t need to keep all your defenses raised to the max at all times. Rather, you need to sense when it’s crucial to assert limits and boundaries — and when it’s safe and right to allow the flow of connection and opportunity. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): The authentic alchemists of medieval times were not foolishly hoping to transmute literal lead and other cheap metals into literal gold. In fact, their goal was to change the wounded, ignorant, unripe qualities of their psyches into beautiful, radiant aspects. The coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to do such magic. Life will provide you with help and inspiration as you try to brighten your shadows. We all need to do this challenging work, Leo! Now is one of your periodic chances to do it really well. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Cosmic rhythms are authorizing you to be extra demanding in the coming days — as long as you are not frivolous, rude, or unreasonable. You have permission to ask for bigger and better privileges that you have previously felt were beyond your grasp. You should assume you have finally earned rights you had not fully earned before now. My advice is to be discerning about how you wield this extra power. Don’t waste it on trivial or petty matters. Use it to generate significant adjustments that will change your life for the better. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): In North America, starlings are an invasive species introduced from Europe in the 19th century. They are problematic, competing with native species for resources. They can damage crops and spread diseases that affect livestock. Yet starlings also create the breathtakingly beautiful marvel known as a murmuration. They make mesmerizing, ever-shifting patterns in the sky while moving as one cohesive unit. We all have starling-like phenomena in our lives — people, situations, and experiences that arouse deeply paradoxical responses, that we both enjoy and disapprove of. According to my analysis, the coming weeks will be prime time to transform and evolve your relationships with these things. It’s unwise to sustain the status quo. I’m not necessarily advising you to banish them — simply to change your connection. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Buildings and walls in the old Incan city of Machu Picchu feature monumental stone blocks that fit together precisely. You can't slip a piece of paper between them. Most are irregularly shaped and weigh many tons. Whoever constructed these prodigious structures benefited from massive amounts of ingenuity and patience. I invite you to summon some of the same blend of diligence and brilliance as you work on your growing masterpiece in the coming weeks and months. My prediction: What you create in 2025 will last a very long time. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Bioluminescence is light emitted from living creatures. They don’t reflect the light of the sun or moon, but produce it themselves. Fireflies do it, and so do glow-worms and certain fungi. If you go to Puerto Rico’s Mosquito Bay, you may also spy the glimmer of marine plankton known as dinoflagellates. The best time to see them show what they can do is on a cloudy night during a new moon, when the deep murk reveals their full power. I believe their glory is a good metaphor for you in the coming days. Your beauty will be most visible and your illumination most valuable when the darkness is at a peak. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Capricorn-born Shah Jahan I was the Emperor of Hindustan from 1628 to 1658. During his reign, he commissioned the Taj Mahal, a magnificent garden and building complex to honor his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This spectacular “jewel of Islamic art” is still a major tourist attraction. In the spirit of Shah Jahan’s adoration, I invite you to dream and scheme about expressing your devotion to what you love. What stirs your heart and nourishes your soul? Find tangible ways to celebrate and fortify your deepest passions. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Over 2,100 years ago, Greek scientists created an analog computer that could track astronomical movements and events decades in advance. Referred to now as the Antikythera mechanism, it was a unique, groundbreaking invention. Similar machines didn’t appear again until Europe in the 14th century. If it’s OK with you, I will compare you with the Antikythera mechanism. Why? You are often ahead of your time with your innovative approaches. People may regard you as complex, inscrutable, or unusual, when in fact you are simply alert for and homing in on future developments. These qualities of yours will be especially needed in the coming weeks and months. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): No cars drove through London’s streets in 1868. That invention was still years away. But the roads were crammed with pedestrians and horses. To improve safety amidst the heavy traffic, a mechanical traffic light was installed — the first in the world. But it had a breakdown a month later, injured a police officer, and was discontinued. Traffic lights didn’t become common for 50 years after that. I believe your imminent innovations will have better luck and good timing, Pisces. Unlike the premature traffic signal, your creations and improvements will have the right context to succeed. Don’t be shy about pushing your good ideas! They could revamp the daily routine.

Now is a fantastic time to unleash a flood of gratitude and appreciation that takes very practical forms. Don’t just beam warm and fuzzy feelings toward your favorite people and animals, in other words. Offer tangible blessings that will actually enhance their lives. Find your own personally meaningful ways to nourish all that nourishes you. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Ancient Egyptians loved the color blue. The mineral azurite and the semiprecious stones turquoise and lapis lazuli satisfied their fascination to some degree, but were rare and difficult to work with. So the Egyptians decided to fabricate their own pigment. After extensive experimentation, using copper, silica, and lime, they succeeded. The hue they made is known as Egyptian blue. I heartily endorse a comparable process for you in the coming weeks, Taurus. Identify the experience, substance, or feeling you really, really want more of, and then resolve to get as much of it as you really, really want. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Dandelions germinate quickly and grow fast. Because of their deep taproots, they are hardy. Once they establish their presence in a place, they persist. Dandelions are adaptable, too, able to grow anywhere their seeds land, even from cracks in concrete. Their efficient dispersal is legendary. They produce large quantities of lightweight seeds that are easily carried by the wind. Bees love dandelions in the spring when there are few other flowers yet to provide them with nectar. I propose we make the dandelion your symbol of power in the coming weeks, Gemini. Be like them! (PS: They are also beautiful in an unostentatious way.) CANCER (June 21-July 22): About 36,000 years ago, humans created remarkable drawings and paintings in the Cave of Altamira, located in what we now call Spain. When an early discoverer of the art published his findings in 1880, he was met with derision. Experts accused him of forgery, saying such beautiful and technically proficient works could not have been made by ancient people, who just weren’t that smart. Eventually, though, the art was proved to be genuine. I propose we meditate on this as a metaphor for your life. It’s possible that your abilities may be underestimated, even by you. Hidden potentials and unexpressed capacities may be close to ripening, but they will need your full confidence and boldness. Don't let skepticism, either from your inner critic or others, hold you back. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): In 1977, NASA launched two Voyager probes to study our solar system’s outer planets. Their original mission was designed to last a few years. But in 2025, they still continue to send back useful information from the great beyond, far past Uranus and Neptune, and into interstellar space. I suspect that now is also a good time for you Leos to seek valuable information from adventures you began years ago. Even if those past experiences have not yielded relevant revelations recently, they may soon do so. Be alert for ways to harvest new riches from old memories. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): About 3,775 years ago, a Babylonian man named Nanni wrote a crabby letter to Ea-nasir, a merchant who had sold him substandard copper ingots. Nanni was also upset that his servant was treated rudely. It is the oldest customer complaint in history. With this as our touchstone, I remind you that maintaining high standards is always crucial for your long-term success. Others may be tempted to cut corners, but your natural integrity is one of your superpowers. Please redouble your commitment to providing highest value, Virgo. And ask for it from others, too. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Blogger Yukiko Kisaki writes about the Japanese concept of ma. She says it’s “the emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled. It’s the purposeful pauses in a speech that make words stand out; the quiet time we all need to make our busy lives meaningful; the silence between the notes that make the music.” According to my analysis, Libra, you will be wise to make ma a central theme in the coming weeks. I invite you to research the power of pauses. Rather than filling up every gap, allow space for pregnant blankness. Trust that in being open to vacancy, you will make room for unexpected riches. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): The literal meaning of the Japanese word yohen is “kiln mutation.” It refers to a type of glaze that undergoes unpredictable variations in color when baked in a kiln. The finished pottery that emerges displays patterns and hues that are blends of the artist’s intention and accidental effects created by the heat. I would love to see you carry out metaphorical versions of yohen in the coming weeks, Scorpio. Suggested meditations: 1. Collaborate to create beauty with energies that aren’t entirely manageable. 2. Undertake projects that require both careful preparation and a willingness to adapt to shifting conditions. 3. Engage with opportunities that will have the best outcomes if you relinquish some control. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): A big party is underway in your astrological House of Self-Understanding and Self-Definition. The near future will be a favorable time to discover yourself in greater depth and bring your identity into clearer focus. I see this mostly as a task for you to carry out in intimate conversation with yourself. It’s also fine to solicit the feedback of allies who have insight into your nature, but I urge you to rely heavily on your private investigations. How can you deepen your knowledge of the reasons you are here on earth? Can you learn more about your dormant potentials? Who are you, exactly? CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan.19): Ethiopian marathon runner Abebe Bikila was selected by his country to compete in the 1960 Rome Olympics. But the honor was offered shortly before the games began, and he had to scramble to get there in time. When he arrived for the main event, he couldn't find any running shoes in local stores that fit comfortably. So he decided to go barefoot for the 26.2-mile race. Success! He won, setting a new world-record time. I propose we make him your role model, Capricorn. May he inspire you to respond to an apparent scarcity or deficiency by calling on earthy alternatives. May you adjust to a problem by deepening your reliance on your natural self. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): After being part of two journeys to Antarctica, Aquarian explorer Ernest Shackleton (1874–1922) assembled a team to try what no one had ever done: crossing the entire continent on foot with pack dogs and motorized sledges. But the proposed 1,800-mile expedition failed soon after it began. That’s when Shackleton did what he is most famous for. His leadership during the harrowing struggle to survive became legendary. I don’t think you will face anything remotely resembling his challenges in the coming weeks. But I suspect that your response to tests and trials will define your success. As you encounter obstacles, you will treat them as opportunities to showcase your resourcefulness and adaptability. You will inspire others to summon resiliency, and you will bring out their best as together you engage in creative problem-solving. Trials will become triumphs. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): I’m not exactly sure where you are going, Pisces, but I’m certain you are headed in the right direction. Your instincts for self-love are at a peak. Your ability to see your best possible future is lucid and strong. Your commitment to gracefully serving all that gracefully serves you is passionate and rigorous. I will congratulate you in advance for locating the exact, robust resources you need, not mediocre resources that are only half-interesting.

I don’t actually buy the central thesis — that a lack of mobility is the main problem damaging “the American Dream.” And blaming it on urbanist prime mover Jane Jacobs would be pure clickbait contrarianism, if more people knew who Jane Jacobs was. That said, the argument hits on so many other interesting points that it’s a pretty essential read anyway. One point that is going to gnaw at my brain for a while is that zoning laws — mandating strict separation of housing from retail, offices, etc. — were born as a work-around to benefit the racist status quo, to keep laundries (and their Chinese immigrant workers) segregated away from existing homeowners. The article goes on to excoriate zoning laws as one of the things stifling the housing market from growing, and freezing Americans in place. From my limited viewpoint here in Pittsburgh, a lot of zoning laws have always seemed to me like just another tool for the idle rich to oppose new housing and make sure their own property values keep climbing ever higher (and who amongst we working folk has the time to hijack a zoning board meeting?). So, yeah, I think zoning laws are mostly bad and easily weaponized to maintain the status quo, and keep newcomers (transplants, immigrants, young people) out. However, I can easily see the exceptions; historic preservation is good, and because most pre-war homes are built to last and come in more useful sizes and combinations than most of what we build today. Plus, some things, like heavy industry, probably don’t belong in the middle of Main Street U.S.A. There’s another theme here that I’m less concerned about than the author — because it ultimately benefits Pittsburgh. It observes that the most economically vibrant places are the one that make it hardest to build — California, “progressive” coastal cities in general — so people are forced to move to less-vibrant places that they can afford. This makes them less productive than they would be otherwise. I mean, Pittsburgh is just sitting here, folks. We’ve got cheap little houses and empty lots galore. We have been vibrant before and could be again. Problem solved. For sale: 1773 Perrysville Ave., Central North Side, $299,000. I love a house with a view, and probably overrate its importance to a significant degree. But I’ve also seen homeowners use the “It will block my view!” argument to torpedo much-needed new housing, which is pretty silly. This cliff dwelling on the North Side should at least enable you to see trouble coming well in advance. Surveying your icy empire swathed in a blanket of sparkling white snow sounds pretty nice. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of LiveWell Apartments LiveWell Apartments, 600 Sixth St. For rent: LiveWell Apartments, 600 Sixth St., Downtown. $1,498-1,955/month. Here’s my contrarian take on Pittsburgh housing: Downtown is good, actually. This isn’t because I don’t believe its myriad, well-documented problems aren’t real — but because they are real, and people apparently want to live there anyway. I don’t have easy answers for homelessness or work-from-home clobbering commercial real estate, but having more people living in apartments Downtown would surely bring some of the old vibrancy back. This building is a big step in the right direction — a beautiful early Beaux Arts terra cotta-clad skyscraper, designed by the great Daniel Burnham, has given up its function as GNC headquarters for a new role as 250 apartments. More of this, please! click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 4003 Coleman St. For sale: 4003 Coleman St., Greenfield, $219,900. Not to get anyone’s hopes up too much, but the sheer amount of price cuts in recent months (including $10,000 knocked off the top here) is starting to add up. Sure, that probably portends ill omens for the economy at large, but hey, housing prices usually only move in the other direction, so take advantage while it lasts. Greenfield is a great neighborhood, so this price-dropping phenomenon isn’t limited to the least attractive corners of the county, either. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of The Roosevelt Building The Roosevelt Building, 609 Penn Ave. For rent: The Roosevelt Building, 609 Penn Ave., Downtown, $1,400/month. Building housing in Downtown Pittsburgh isn’t easy, or something that can be done cheaply. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible, or that the previous paradigm of million-dollar condos and subsidized housing and nothing in between is still in effect. There’s this housing adaptation of the Roosevelt Hotel, built in 1927, for instance. This isn’t the spooky ghost town of “First Side” either; the Roosevelt is right in the heart of the Cultural District. You can walk downstairs, out the door, and be at a world-class symphony or off-Broadway production, or big-league ballgame (or, well, the Pirates) in minutes. It’s not Manhattan, but the same $1,400 there will barely get you a seat on the subway, let alone a place like this. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 4018 Oswald St. For sale: 4018 Oswald St., Brighton Heights, $299,900. If you were going to fly in an airplane, would you choose today’s model over the version made in 1906? Of course! The Wright Bros. had only figured out flight three years before, and planes were basically giant kites with lawnmower engines. So how did we build houses in 1906 that are equal to — and frequently better — than the stuff we build today? (I have no idea). Sure, this particular 1906 house has some olive-green siding and weird little windows that didn’t come with the original, and were not improvements. But this house is going to be here standing strong, even when every 1970s ranch house has crumbled to dust. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Apartments at River View, 300 Liberty Ave. For rent: Apartments at River View, 300 Liberty Ave., Downtown, $1,399/month. This adaptation of an obsolete mid-century office building has units that range from the reasonable ($1,400) to the preposterous ($6,000), which is basically … fine? Neighborhoods that can appeal to renters at different price points and stages of life tend to be lively and interesting, and the sheer range of options in this building alone is pretty remarkable. Perhaps it’s a function of retrofitting a building that was designed for something else: some units are going to be spacious and others will be small and oddly shaped.

If you’re unhappy about the cost of housing, you need to build more of it. Well, not you personally. But someone does. More supply = less upward pressure on prices. There’s no other mechanism for creating the amount of affordable housing we need. Well, aside from economic collapse, crippling depression, or a nightmarish crime wave. That should bring prices down. So, whose job is it to build housing? Kickstarter? Paul Skenes? Gritty? Yes, the government can build homes, but the history of public housing in America isn’t a good one (it’s better in some other countries). Government should probably still do some of that. But that doesn’t seem like a priority for the federal government at the moment, and local government has enough trouble just keeping the lights on. The state would probably have to invent a new tax to make a dent. (I suggest taxing mobile quarterbacks, and the color green. Why? No reason.) Until we come up with some other, better idea, most of our housing comes from people who want to make money. It’s not a great system, but it’s what we have to work with. Communities should demand and incentivize affordability from developers. But the most important thing is getting as much housing built as possible, which is the only thing that will reliably bring prices down. So just build housing. For sale: 1714-1716 Lowrie St., Troy Hill, $265,000. Oh, wow, I have a niece named Victoria and I kind of want to buy her Victoria’s Dairy and open an ice cream shop inside it. Is that so wrong? I’ll be able to afford that approximately one month before the sun finally burns out, so you might want to move faster. This was the American dream before it mutated into a monster McMansion in the suburbs — a place to start a business, build a life apart from the entrenched hierarchies and hatreds of the old country, and live above the shop so your kids can see the value of your work. (Or something like that). Or, if you just want a place to sell your collection of Bubby Brister and Ulf Samuelsson jerseys, go right ahead. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 5302 Butler St., Apt. 1 For rent: 5302 Butler St., Apt. 1, Lawrenceville, $1,125/month. It’s nice to feel wanted, right? Like this apartment is so excited to get you in there that the door is literally hanging open, a moving van is right there with the engine running, and there’s a mop ready to clean those floors one more time (or twice, would that help?). Butler St. in Lawrenceville is a tough place to live if you hate good food, interesting bars, and young people. Somehow, it went from sad, post-industrial decline to startling affluence without national chains ever arriving. Yes, I’m aware that some people are unhappy about all this, but every Larryville old-timer I’ve ever interviewed in the last 20 years seemed thrilled to sell their home to some ignorant out-of-towner and pursue the ancient yinzer dream of moving to Shaler. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 420 Ridge Ave. For sale: 420 Ridge Ave., Carnegie, $114,900. Is Carnegie the new Brighton Heights? By that I mean “a ridiculously undervalued location full of great looking homes for 1990s prices.” This house doesn’t come with every modern convenience; when it was built (in 1900), nobody needed a garage because nobody had a car because they had only just been invented. That metal awning probably sounds like a demolition derby in a rainstorm, so budget a little extra to make it go away. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow The Yards at 3 Crossings, 2645 Railroad St. For rent: The Yards at 3 Crossings, 2645 Railroad St., Strip District, $1,505/month. I’m not going to pretend to love the design of these apartments — the orange and gray-dazzle-camo will not age well. But this is precisely where big new apartment buildings should go — along the Allegheny River in the Strip, where almost everything from food to jobs to recreation is in walking distance. This was industrial land, then largely vacant, so there’s really no one to displace. I’m sure there’s a downside to this, but I struggle to imagine what it is. The rivers are nice now! Build housing on the nice rivers! Build so much of it that moderately affluent newcomers buy/rent there and stop driving up rents on the weird little houses in marginal neighborhoods! click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 2620 Salisbury St. For sale: 2620 Salisbury St., Arlington, $189,900. Every time I think about how much better things were when I was a kid, I just think about something called Salisbury Steak. That was a dish that we were often excited to eat, that looked and tasted like a cut of meat seasoned by sticking it inside your shoe for a week. Food is so much better now; you have no idea. This house is on Salisbury St., which has nothing to do with the steak. In fact, it looks almost spotless for a house that has weathered decades of steel mill soot and brutal winters. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 1350 Evers Dr. For rent: 1350 Evers Dr., Apt. 36, Lincoln-Lemington, $950/month. I can remember when East Liberty had such a reputation for crime and decay that landlords would call it “East End” or even “East Shadyside” instead. Now, they’re stretching the definition of East Liberty to cover all adjacent neighborhoods, because East Liberty is a hot selling point. Honestly, this sucks then and it sucks now — just be honest about where you’re located. You’re not fooling anybody. If this place was really in East Liberty, it would cost like three times as much.

OK, time for a semi-curated array of mildly interesting data points — or a silly Pittsburgh listicle roundup, whichever you prefer. First, something called RealtyHop (a real estate website) says that it takes 3.82 years to afford a $49,000 down payment on a home. Wow, that sounds terrible. I could eat Mrs. T’s frozen pierogies for every meal for a decade and that wouldn’t make a dent in $49,000. Oh, wait, according to the report, this is actually good. Pittsburgh is easier/cheaper than all but four of the top 100 American cities. Things are rough out there. Then, there’s Zumper’s National Rent Index, which notes that Pittsburgh rents — the 49th most expensive market — are up 9.2% in the past year, with the median price of one-bedroom units at $1,300 and two-bedrooms at $1,500. Meanwhile, the national rent index actually decreased this month for one-bedroom units by 0.3%, to $1,534, and increased slightly for two-bedrooms to $1,907. Maybe this is right, and it certainly seems within the realm of plausibility. Even if Zumper sounds like one of those random combinations of syllables thrown together to describe a new medication with a mile-long list of unsettling side effects, like “may cause suicidal thoughts and occasional resurrection after death.” Then there’s Wallethub’s Best and Worst Cities for Football Fans. Yep, we’re number one — which suggests they haven’t talked to a Steelers fan in the past decade or so. Steelers fans are both the best and the worst football fans in America. We’re pretty knowledgeable; you’re never surprised when anyone (drag queens, philosophy professors, your grandma) can diagram a zone blitz or evaluate the nose tackles in this year’s draft class. But we’re also pretty whiny and entitled, and act like it’s the end of the world when we experience the mildest setbacks — or even just fail to win the Super Bowl every year. It could always be worse; contemplate, just for a second, the soul-destroying despair of the average Cleveland Browns fan. And then thank your lucky stars if you’ve avoided that fate. For sale: 122 Richbarn Rd., Brighton Heights, 214,900. Brighton Heights strikes again with this attractive bungalow for a throwback price. That porch seems to have enough room for a dodgeball game, and the interior 1,308 square feet seem very roomy for the price, which has dropped by $5,000 recently. That’s either a good sign or a bad one depending on whether you’re trying to buy or sell. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Gladstone Residences, 327 Hazelwood Ave. For rent: Gladstone Residences, 327 Hazelwood Ave., Hazelwood, $696-1,618/month. Despite the happy talk about new breweries and job opportunities at Hazelwood Green, Hazelwood seemingly grows emptier every year. Part of the problem is just a lack of properties that one could buy or rent. This newly completed redevelopment of the old (1914) Gladstone high school is a drop in the bucket, but a welcome one. It’s got studios and one-and-two-bedroom units in a complex that adapts to challenging hillside topography by connecting two buildings via skywalk. So far, the promises to keep affordable units seem to be holding, though that could obviously change. One side of the property sits on Hazelwood Ave., an unpleasant road that sorely needs some speed bumps. On the other side is a largely abandoned series of streets gradually giving way to the encroaching entropy of the forest. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 16 Walkers Mill Rd. For sale: 16 Walkers Mill Rd., Carnegie, $120,000. To get those low, low prices of yore, you have to expect some compromises. You have to decide what you can live with, and what you can’t live without. Usually, windows are one of those things that you don’t need to worry about though. This odd little aquamarine-painted place in Carnegie does exude a certain woodsy charm, with a farmhouse-like ceiling, floors, and a smattering of critter skulls on the walls (which probably don’t come with the house). The color probably grows on you after a while, but presenting a blank, featureless wall to the street is pretty off-putting. Compromises! click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow Georgian, 5437 Ellsworth Ave. For rent: Georgian, 5437 Ellsworth Ave., Shadyside, $1,055-1,255/month. It’s fun when an apartment building is important enough to have a name, and “Georgian” is pretty good as apartment names go. This is a beautiful building, and rents are somehow still hanging around turn-of-the-century numbers. Sure, that’s a 475-square-foot studio, which is not a lot. But if you’re new to town, or just moved out of a dorm, or simply don’t have the physical and existential weight of decades of stuff weighing you down, it’s probably enough. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 2126 Lautner St. For sale: 2126 Lautner St., Troy Hill, $249,000. Built in 1927, but it doesn’t look a day over 90. Actually, this place cleaned up very nice, and from the inside there’s no way to determine it’s vintage. Very bright, white and minimalist, but the remaining original features — the wooden floor — make it feel a little bit warmer and more inviting. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 3320 Cargill St. For rent: 3320 Cargill St., Polish Hill, $900/month. Are we at that point where “well, at least there are windows” is a meaningful observation? Polish Hill is a great neighborhood, in walking distance to major job centers, amenities, and lots of great places to eat. But the housing stock is still a bit rough, and it’s very hard to build anything here, so you sort of have to take what you can get. Family lore contends that my grandpa, the blacksmith, forged some of the ironwork for the giant, green-domed church in Polish Hill. This might be one of the only neighborhoods that he would recognize, were he alive today, but it would be nice if there were a few new houses/apartments that people could choose.

It’s Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni salt flat, a vast area that’s almost perfectly flat. After a rain, a thin layer of calm water transforms the surface into a perfect reflector that can be used to calibrate observation satellites. In these conditions, it may be almost impossible to tell where the earth begins and the sky ends. I foresee metaphorically similar developments for you during the coming weeks. Boundaries between different aspects of your world — professional and personal, spiritual and practical — might blur in interesting ways. A temporary dissolution of the usual limits may offer you surprising insights and unexpected opportunities for realignment. Be alert for helpful clues about how to adjust the way you see things. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): From day to day, glaciers appear static. But they are actually slow-moving rivers of ice that have tremendous creative power. They can make or reshape valleys, moving tons of dirt and rock. They pulverize, grind, and topple trees, hills, and even mountains. New lakes may emerge in the course of their activity. I invite you to imagine yourself as a glacier in the coming months, Taurus. Exult in your steady transformative power. Notice and keep track of your slow but sure progress. Trust that your persistence will ultimately accomplish wonders and marvels. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): In recent weeks, have you stirred up any dynamic fantasies about exotic sanctuaries or faraway places or mercurial wild cards? Have you delivered enticing messages to inspiring beauties or brave freedom-fighters or vibrant networkers? Have you been monitoring the activities of longshots or future helpers or unification adepts who might be useful to you sooner than you imagine? Finally, Gemini, have you noticed I’m suggesting that everything important will arise in threes — except when they come in twos, in which case you should hunt for the missing third? PS: When the wild things call to you, respond promptly. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Archaeologists found two 43,000-year-old flutes in Germany. Constructed of mammoth ivory and bird bone, they still produce clear notes with perfect pitch. They were located in a cave that contains ancient examples of figurative art. Some genius way back then regarded art and music as a pleasurable pairing! I propose we make these instruments your power symbols for the coming weeks, Cancerian. May they inspire you to resuscitate the value of your past accomplishments. May you call on the help of melodies and memories that still resonate — and that can inspire your future adventures! Your words of power are regeneration, revival, and reanimation. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): It's your unbirthday season, Leo — the holiday that’s halfway between your last birthday and your next. During this interlude, you could benefit from clarifying what you don’t want, don’t believe, and don’t like. You may generate good fortune for yourself by going on a quest to discover rich potentials and stirring possibilities that are as-yet hidden or unexpressed. I hope you will be bold enough to scan the frontiers for sources of beauty and truth that you have been missing. During your unbirthday season, you will be wise to gather the rest of the information you will need to make a smart gamble or daring change. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Austrian playwright Elfriede Jelinek won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004, and Romanian-German author Herta Müller earned it in 2009. But garnering the world’s most prestigious award for writers did not provide a big boost to their book sales. In some markets, their famous works are now out of print. In 2025, I hope you Virgos do in your own spheres what they only half-accomplished in theirs. I would love for you to gather more appreciation and attention while simultaneously raising your income. According to my reading of the astrological omens, this is a reasonable expectation. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): By day, Libra-born Forrest Bess (1911–1977) worked as a commercial fisherman in Texas. By night, he created visionary paintings inspired by symbols that appeared to him in states between sleeping and waking. Other influences in his art came from alchemy, the psychological philosophy of Carl Jung, and Indigenous Australian rituals. His life was living proof that mystical exploration and mundane work could coexist. I’m hoping he might serve you as an inspirational role model. You are in a phase when you have the power to blend and synergize seemingly opposing aspects of your world. You would be wise to meditate on how to find common ground between practical necessity and spiritual aspiration. Are there ways you can unite the desires of your head and heart? Of your need for safety and your longing for adventure? Of your craving for beauty and your fondness for usefulness? SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, arranged for himself to be buried after death with an army of 8,000 soldiers made from terracotta, which is a clay ceramic. Joining the gang below the earth’s surface were 770 horses and 130 chariots. For over 2,000 years, this assemblage was lost and forgotten. But in 1974, farmers digging a new well found it accidentally. In this spirit, I am predicting that sometime in the next five months, you will make interesting discoveries while looking for something other than what you find. They won’t be as spectacular as the terracotta army, but I bet they will be fun and life changing. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Author Zora Neale Hurston said, \"There are years that ask questions and years that answer.\" I will adjust that counsel for your use, Sagittarius. According to my astrological analysis, the first half of 2025 will ask questions, and the second half will answer them. For best results, I invite you to gather and polish your best questions in the next five months, carefully defining and refining them. When July begins, tell life you are ready to receive replies to your carefully wrought inquiries. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Hemoglobin is an iron-bearing protein that’s crucial to most life. It enables the transportation of oxygen in the blood. But one species, the icefish of the Antarctic seas, lacks hemoglobin. They evolved other ways to obtain and circulate enough oxygen in the frozen depths, including larger hearts and blood vessels. The system they’ve developed works well. So they are examples of how to adjust to an apparent problem in ways that lead to fine evolutionary innovations. I suspect you’re now in the midst of your own personal version of a comparable adaptation. Keep up the good work! AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Born under the sign of Aquarius, Clyde Tombaugh discovered the heavenly body known as Pluto in 1930. This was years before he earned advanced degrees in astronomy. His early education was primarily self-directed. The telescopes he used to learn the sky were built from tractor parts and old car components from his father’s farm. During the coming months, I surmise there will be elements of your life resembling Tombaugh’s story. Your intuition and instincts will bring you insights that may seem unearned or premature. (They’re not!) You will garner breakthroughs that seem to be arriving from the future. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): One of the world’s deepest caves is Veryovkina in the nation of Georgia. At its lowest, it’s 7,257 feet down. There are creatures living there that are found nowhere else on earth. I propose we make it your symbolic power spot for now. In my astrological opinion, you will be wise to dive further into the unknown depths than you have in quite some time. Fascinating mysteries and useful secrets await you. Your motto: “Go deeper and deeper and deeper.” Mark as Favorite Unmark as Favorite Tags Free Will Astrology, horoscope, Rob Brezsny Related Content FREE WILL ASTROLOGY March 13-19 By Rob Brezsny Mar 12, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY March 6-12 By Rob Brezsny Mar 5, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY Feb 27 - March 5 By Rob Brezsny Feb 26, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY Feb. 20-26 By Rob Brezsny Feb 19, 2025 Latest in Free Will Astrology FREE WILL ASTROLOGY March 13-19 By Rob Brezsny Mar 12, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY March 6-12 By Rob Brezsny Mar 5, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY Feb 27 - March 5 By Rob Brezsny Feb 26, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY Feb. 20-26 By Rob Brezsny Feb 19, 2025 More » More Free Will Astrology All Columns Current Issue Digital Edition This Week March 12-18, 2025 Previous Issues Slideshow 18 images Runners brave the cold in their undies for charity By Mars Johnson Feb 16, 2025 Trending Affordable-ish Housing in Pittsburgh: the dark gods of Zillow edition By Michael Machosky Mar 14, 2025 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Allegheny Land Trust, Community Forge, KSD Tattoo, and more By Stacy Rounds Mar 10, 2025 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY March 13-19 By Rob Brezsny Mar 12, 2025 Now Hiring in Pittsburgh: Citiparks, Emiliano's, Tiny Seed Farm, and more By Stacy Rounds Mar 3, 2025 Things To Do This Week Pittsburgh’s top events:March 13-19 About Pittsburgh City Paper Contact Us CP Careers RSS Feed Advertise Submit/Promote an Event Job Listings Become a Member Get a Subscription Shop CP Store Sponsored Content Freelance Pitch Guidelines Get Our Daily Newsletter Privacy Policy © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper"

Last week’s column was about how much I hate the dominant greige-minimalist home-design aesthetic. I mean, that’s cool if you want a house with as much character as a Chipotle or one of those fleece vests tech bros wear. (Hey, if that’s your thing, be my guest). Pittsburgh’s housing stock — by some measures, the oldest in the country — does not lend itself to greige very easily, anyway. That’s more of a suburban aesthetic. We don’t look feature the suburbs much in this column, but we probably should, because Pittsburgh has quite a few that don’t conform at all to the current trends. And, because of that, they stay somewhat affordable — without going greige. For example, there are two very different western neighborhoods that seem like great places to live for very different reasons — the urban-ish, walkable Carnegie, and the mostly residential Crafton, which has a lot of really beautiful, very old houses. Here’s a little sampling from each: For rent: 1035 Campbells Run Rd., Carnegie, $800/month. Whoa, that’s green — like somewhere between key lime green and liquified-Grinch green. I don’t hate it. Inside it’s bright and clean and has nice wooden floors, a ceiling fan, and air-conditioning, which is a lot of things for $800 a month. Plus, this house is automatically a local landmark and impossible to miss (the color-blind excepted). click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 206 6th Ave. For sale: 206 6th Ave., Carnegie, $213,000. Steel magnate Andrew Carnegie — benevolent benefactor or robber baron? Eh, probably a bit of both. At least he seemed to feel bad about crushing his workers and everyone in his way and built a bunch of libraries as a sort of self-inflicted penance. It would be nice if our current crop of robber barons did this, instead of, well, you know. The library up on the hill here — the Carnegie Carnegie — is one of the nicest in the region. This house was built when old Andrew Carnegie was still alive, 1902, and looks pretty good for a 123-year-old. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 326 7th Ave. For sale: 326 7th Ave., Carnegie, $199,000. Six bedrooms (!) and enough porch space to drive a Zamboni through, for under $200,000? Oh, and you can walk to perhaps the South Hills’ best coffee shop, Carnegie Coffee Company (a comfy community hub in a converted post office) a lovely little bookshop, Wooly Bear Books and Gifts (soon moving to bigger digs on Main St.), several unpretentious bars, and at least three (!) diners for breakfast. Throw in a record store and a National Park and this is basically paradise for me; your mileage may vary. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 716 Idlewood Ave. For rent: 716 Idlewood Ave., East Carnegie, $1,200/month. Honestly, I want to see people’s books and record collections in a home listing — not to judge them (well, maybe a little, as a treat) — but because it’s evidence of people living full lives in a place. I would also live in a library (Carnegie, of course) if I could, so maybe that’s just peculiar to me. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 66 Thomas St. For sale: 66 Thomas St., Crafton, $249,500. In 1890, when this house was built, there were no cars on the road because they only existed in Germany. (So nobody had the foresight to tack on a three-car garage). And yet, this house was built, and somehow it’s superior to much of what was built after. That much porch space is like having another entire house to hang out in, albeit not one that’s very useful this time of year. I’m not a huge fan of the outdoor paint scheme, but the navy blue cabinetry in the kitchen is oddly appealing. click to enlarge Photo: Courtesy of Zillow 146 Noble Ave. For rent: 146 Noble Ave., Crafton, $875/month. What did this beautiful 19th-century apartment building used to be? A bank that John Dillinger cased? A buggy-whip factory? A cabaret? Thank you to whatever saintly ancestor who decided not raze this thing and put a drive-thru bank or a Taco Bell here. Needless to say, it’s illegal to build extremely attractive, useful, and inexpensive housing for different-sized families in 98% of post-war suburbs, because, well, poor people might want to live there. Their loss; Crafton gets it.
