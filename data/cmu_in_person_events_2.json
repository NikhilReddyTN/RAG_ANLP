        "content": "Have a Question? Let Us Help You! What is annual giving? If I give online, is my information secure? Why is my annual gift important? Can I choose where my money is spent? How many consecutive years have I given? What is the Carnegie Mellon Fund? Is the Carnegie Mellon Fund the same as the Annual Fund? Do company matching gifts count toward donor recognition? What is the Carnegie Mellon University's Tax ID/EIN Number? How much should I give? I'd like to establish a scholarship. What do I do? Where should I direct my gift? What is Carnegie Mellon’s fiscal year? Why is it important? What is the endowment? Endowment is the permanent capital of a university. Endowment refers to assets that are invested in perpetuity, unlike expendable funds, which are typically used for immediate needs. While the endowment principal remains in tact, annually a portion of the income is made available to the university. Therefore, by building the endowment, Carnegie Mellon has a greater ability to pay for its operating expenses. A larger endowment provides the university with greater flexibility in launching new projects or initiatives as well as in providing greater support to faculty and students. A common misconception about a university’s endowment is that it is one \"pot\" of money with which the university can do what it wishes. Endowments are comprised of many separate funds, which are managed as a pool of assets. Donors set stipulations for funds and for what purpose the income may be spent. If you have further questions, contact us at412-268-2582orannual-giving@andrew.cmu.eduand we'll be happy to discuss the ins and outs of endowment, expendable and other fancy financial terms.

        "content": "Create Income with Giving Looking for a way to generate extra income during your retirement years while continuing to support Carnegie Mellon University? A variety of options such as a charitable annuity, charitable trust or gift to a pooled income fund might fit the bill. These options provide you with payments for life, help you reach your retirement and inheritance goals and show your love of the Tartan community. The Office of Gift Planning teamis happy to provide personalized examples of how any of these gifts might work for you and support CMU for generations to come. Contact Us Charitable Annuities This option is a simple and straight-forward agreement between you and Carnegie Mellon University. In exchange for a gift of cash or appreciated assets, you receive fixed payments for life. Why Choose a Charitable Annuity? Types of Charitable Annuities Immediate:You or your chosen beneficiaries immediately start receiving a fixed payment for life, some of which may be tax free. Deferred:After a specific date, CMU will begin to pay up to two annuitants of your choice, fixed annuity payments for life — at a time when you may most want additional cash flow such as in retirement. Flexible:You select a range of dates in the future when you want CMU to begin paying fixed payments to you or up to two annuitants of your choice. This is similar to Social Security payments in that the longer you wait, the higher the payment. Charitable Trusts With a charitable trust, more specifically acharitable remainder trust, you can pursue your philanthropic goals in support of CMU while still generating income for you and your loved ones. Your trust is highly customizable and can be designed to financially support as many people as you wish and eventually benefit multiple charities. It can be a particularly attractive planning tool for gifts of hard-to-value assets that have greatly appreciated in value over the years, such as real estate and closely held business interests. How Does a Charitable Trust Work? Additional Information on Charitable Trusts Types of Charitable Trusts Annuity:An annuity trust pays you the same dollar amount each year that you choose at the start. Your payments remain unchanged for life, regardless of fluctuations in trust investments. Unitrust:A unitrust pays you a variable amount yearly based on a percentage of the value of the trust assets. The amount of your payments is recalculated annually. If the value of the trust increases, so do your payments. Pooled Income Fund A pooled income fund offers you variable income today with an opportunity for future growth — making it an attractive retirement planning tool for younger donors wishing to create a future impact. Why Choose a Pooled Income Fund? This information is for illustration purposes only and should not be considered legal, accounting or other professional advice. Please consult with your personal legal, tax and financial counsel prior to making a charitable gift.

It remains to be the coolest conference I've ever attended! Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I have loved being an active alumnus and serving as an organizer of DC's Globally Plaid series, speaking on alumni panels, serving as a Heinz College mentor, and helping with mock interviewing.

I was part of an international fashion show and also did a ballroom dance group number.

A bonus is actually talking to the students on their research studies. Christian Hagen(HNZ 1996)Niwot, CO Favorite CMU memory:I bleed Carnegie Plaid. If you really want my attention, include Scotty Dog. My first month of school, I had tailgate parties that included such dignitaries as university Deans and the famed mascot himself. This memory is one of my favorites and most mentioned by my good friends from CMU. Why did you join the AAB?My passion for CMU has not waned since leaving Pittsburgh.

This includes recruiting, student consulting initiatives, and attending alumni events near home. I recently moved from Chicago to Colorado. James Harrison(CFA 1993)Houston, TX What do you like most about staying engaged?One of the benefits of being on a college campus is the diversity of thought.

I am indebted to The University for being so supportive in helping me pursue my post-graduate education and my career. I love coming back to campus and interfacing with the students, faculty and staff. This Board provides yet another opportunity for me to have a positive impact at the University level and in the alumni community. Philip Mason(MCS 1967; SCS 1976)Hopkinton, MA Favorite CMU memory:During my 10 years as a CMU undergrad, PhD student, and instructor from the 1960’s through the mid 1970’s, I took advantage of the unique environment where everyone on campus could use CMU computers, initially with punch cards and later in computer rooms with teletypes. I was a participant in the formation of a new discipline. I also loved playing clarinet in the Kiltie Marching and Concert bands with the fabulous music majors. We had memorable trips performing at a National Music Educators convention in Buffalo and at Town Hall in New York City.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Tartan pride is alive in my household. The connection we have from studying at, working at, and/or supporting Carnegie Mellon University is genuine and rewarding. It brings me joy to build personal relationships with the CMU community and receive a smile simply from saying, I am a Tartan, too! Rebecca Paren(SCS 2015)Austin, Texas Favorite CMU Memory:It is really hard to pick just one! A big highlight was planning the concert for the 100th Carnival; being on Activities Board was an amazing community, and getting to plan and see the events was so energizing. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I loved my time at CMU. I got so much out of it, and one of the best parts was the people.

That convenience made it easy to be efficient with projects and homework, which enabled me to indulge in Buggy ... a sincere passion, GO SPIRIT!!! Why did you join the AAB?Having been an active alum for many years, my professional experience will hopefully be extremely helpful to both alums and the university. Specifically, giving-back in any fashion has been a passion for decades and having raised two daughters who are both college graduates, along with corporate experience in recruiting and career development, I believe I can help improve the experience for all parties involved. Andrés Vélez(TPR 2014)New York City Favorite CMU memory:Watching my two older sisters apply to, study at, and graduate from CMU was probably one of the most impactful and inspiring CMU memories of mine. They blazed the trail, set the standards and showed me what was possible at, and with, a degree and network from CMU. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?It is so exciting to be around such a motivated, intelligent and hard-working group of people, across disciplines. I love to hear about what different students and alumni are doing as well as learn from them.

At five years of giving, members receive their first milestone pin to recognize their dedication to the CMU community. The Order of the May is named for Albert C. May (ENG 1921, 1922), who founded the Annual Fund at Carnegie Tech in 1947 and contributed to it every year until he passed away in 1998. The Order of the May honors all those who embody the spirit of generosity and characteristics for which Mr. May is remembered. Commemorative Pins Beginning in March 2024, commemorative Order of the May pins will be issued to donors every five years to celebrate significant milestones of consecutive giving: five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and lifetime membership (awarded at 25 years).
