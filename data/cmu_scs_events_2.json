My thesis presents a practical approach for experts to monitor large-scale aggregate public health data. These novel big data monitoring methods identify data corresponding to quality issues or changes in disease dynamics and are simple, scalable, generalizable, and shown to be accurate in real-world settings based on human-labeled data. When paired with custom user interfaces, these methods have led to a 53-fold increase in monitoring efficiency for data experts at the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Experts can now detect over 200 noteworthy data issues from 15 million new data points each week. The output of this thesis' monitoring approach can directly support public health surveillance, especially at the state or national level, and increase the utility of public health data modernization efforts for data-driven decision-making.  \n\nThesis Committee\nRoni Rosenfeld (Co-Chair)\nBryan Wilder (Co-Chair)\nRayid Ghani\nMatthew Biggerstaff (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\nIn Person and Zoom: \nhttps://cmu.zoom.us/j/96888473741?pwd=9aLy04zEDQZBJ0ols8rR80pKud1YbA.1 Participation.

        "description": "Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, we present both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables. \n\nThesis Committee\nProf. Jean Oh (Chair)\nProf. David Held\nProf. Jeffrey Ichnowski\nUksang Yoo\n\nIn Person and Zoom: \nhttps://cmu.zoom.us/j/96622335877?pwd=mEdxLhQxSC3lgiOKzhC5lqduB2WAfE.1 Participation.

        "description": "Computer security is traditionally about the protection of digital systems from adversaries such as criminals or governments. In this talk, I will explore what I call known-adversary threat models, in which the adversary is a member of the victim's social circles—an intimate partner, family member, or other close acquaintance—and who seeks to cause harm to the victim, not just their technology. Known-adversary threat models are a widespread and increasingly severe problem, and their study opens up a new frontier for computer security research and practice.\n\nThis perspective has emerged from my research and advocacy in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). Our research details the multifaceted and damaging ways in which abusers exploit technology to harass, impersonate, threaten, monitor, intimidate, and otherwise harm their partner via spyware, social media, tracking tools, account compromise, and more. To make progress, I take an advocate-scientist approach that blends ongoing evidence-based design and delivery of clinics that directly assist survivors suffering tech abuse; systemic advocacy for new laws and policies; and basic research into how to design technology to improve its security in the face of known-adversary threats. The latter requires understanding and resolving complex tensions between known-adversary and traditional threat models, with result being principled reworkings of some of our most fundamental security tools to increase security and safety for all users.\n\nThe talk will include discussion of physical, sexual, and emotional violence.\n\n—\n\nThomas Ristenpart: \nhttps://rist.tech.cornell.edu/ is a Professor at Cornell Tech and a member of the Computer Science department at Cornell University.

However, they continue to face critical limitations, including hallucinations and outdated knowledge, which hinder their reliability—especially in expert domains such as scientific research and software development. In this talk, I will argue that addressing these challenges requires moving beyond monolithic LMs and toward Augmented LMs—a new AI paradigm that designs, trains, and deploys LMs alongside complementary modules to enhance reliability and efficiency. Focusing on my research on Retrieval-Augmented LMs, one of the most impactful and widely adopted forms of Augmented LMs today, I will begin by presenting systematic analyses of current LM shortcomings and demonstrating how retrieval augmentation offers a more scalable and effective path forward. I will then discuss my work on establishing new foundations for these systems, including novel training approaches and retrieval mechanisms that enable LMs to dynamically adapt to diverse inputs. Finally, I will showcase the real-world impact of such models through OpenScholar, our fully open Retrieval-Augmented LM for assisting scientists in synthesizing literature—now used by over 30,000 researchers and practitioners worldwide. I will conclude by outlining my vision for the future of Augmented LMs, emphasizing advancements in abilities to handle heterogeneous modalities, more efficient and flexible integration with diverse components, and rigorous evaluation through interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n—\n\nAkari Asai: https://akariasai.github.io/ is a Ph.D. candidate in the Paul G.

        "description": "AI-based decision support (ADS) systems hold the promise of helping trained experts make decisions in healthcare, social services, and other important disciplines. Although these tools often seem to achieve high accuracy by learning patterns in large datasets of historical decisions and outcomes, many ADS systems ultimately fail to support decision-makers. It is as yet unclear why these systems fall short of their potential when integrated into real-world workflows, and how we can design ADS that better fosters complementarity with expert users.\n\nThis thesis aims to reconcile the perspectives of domain experts with the challenges that data science teams face when building ADS. First, I investigate expert decision-makers' perspectives on real AI systems in three high-stakes domains: child maltreatment screening, regional opioid overdose risk, and sepsis treatment in critical care. These studies show that existing ADS systems often neglect experts' broader goals, values, and contextual knowledge by attempting to directly recommend decisions, leading to fundamental misalignments and barriers to adoption. To mitigate these misalignments, I then develop two systems that support data scientists in the challenging work of building ADS models, while enabling domain experts to critique how the models are built and how they might behave in practice. Finally, in my proposed work I plan to evaluate a range of ADS designs that move beyond conventional recommendations. Working in the sepsis domain that I have previously studied, I will conduct think-aloud sessions and a larger-scale survey study to understand how different forms of ADS influence clinicians' reasoning as well as the quality of their decisions.\n\nMy work contributes to the fields of human-AI interaction, data visualization, and AI in healthcare by highlighting the pitfalls and opportunities of designing ADS for experts. In these domains, the AI's predictive task is often just one part of a constellation of related goals; rather than calibrating their reliance on the AI, expert users are likely to adopt its insights in whatever way best meets those goals. Experts are also uniquely equipped to critique and help improve ADS designs as part of model building teams, as long as modeling choices and behaviors are made transparent to them. Finally, my proposed work broadens current evaluation strategies for ADS beyond metrics like trust and reliance, focusing instead on how AI can support or impede reasoning as one small part of a complex workflow. Together, these contributions provide a conceptual and empirical foundation for future ADS systems that live up to the promise of complementing experts.\n\nThesis Committee\nAdam Perer (Chair)\nMayank Goel\nHaiyi Zhu\nSuchi Saria (Johns Hopkins University/Bayesian Health)\n\nAdditional Information: \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O42Wn-_7u8yo63G9l5p_0ouF4TKmxk95?usp=sharing\n\nIn Person and Zoom: \nhttps://cmu.zoom.us/j/98846545071?pwd=itF42pTmwUhZblmM5wdk5McN63IP1S.1 Participation.

        "description": "Join in for an inspiring lecture on the mysteries of prime numbers, presented by James A. Maynard, a Fields Medal laureate: \nhttps://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/news/professor-james-maynard-awarded-prestigious-fields-medal/ and Fellow of the Royal Society.  Prime numbers hold secrets that have fascinated mathematicians for centuries.  For instance, how often do two prime number differ by exactly 2?  This simple yet famous question remains unsolved, despite over a hundred years of dedicated effort.  Recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to number theory, Maynard will explore these enduring puzzles, revealing how patterns in prime numbers connect not only to pure mathematics but also to real-world applications, such as securing our online communications.\n\nAbstract  — How often do two prime numbers differ by exactly 2? This simple (and famous) question is unsolved despite mathematicians working on it for over 100 years. Moreover, basic questions like this about prime numbers turn out to lie at the heart of many important real-world questions. For example, it turns out that the security of internet communication (which we rely on whenever we buy something online) is related to basic questions about patterns in prime numbers which we don't know how to solve!\n\nI'll talk about why prime numbers are so special to mathematicians, how important questions in both pure mathematics and the real world turn out to be connected to primes, and how we are making progress towards solving these famous problems which have been studied for hundreds of years.\n\n—\n\nThe Pittsburgh Mathematical Horizons lecture series was made possible by a generous donation of the Benter Foundation. The lectures are hosted by the University of Pittsburgh.  The lecture is  open and accessible to the science-interested public of all ages, this presentation promises to illuminate the elegance of mathematics and its profound impact on our understanding of the world.  \n\nReception will follow the presentation."

        "description": "As language-related technologies like automatic speech recognition (ASR) and the quality of audio recording on average smartphones continues to improve, this opens the door for new methodologies in linguistic research. In this talk, I show how we’ve leveraged language technologies to develop a new type of sociolinguistic data set, through the MI Diaries project. In MI Diaries, participants self-record “audio diaries” using our open-source smart phone app. This low barrier to participation enables us to obtain (1) much larger quantities of high-quality speech data than previous face-to-face sociolinguistic methodologies allows for and (2) encourages longitudinal participation, meaning that we can actually track sociolinguistic change in real time for some speakers. Integrating ASR with our research framework further enables us to identify and analyze sociolinguistic features that occur too infrequently to analyze using traditional means. I present two case studies of sociolinguistic findings that would not have been possible without this technology: (1) idiosyncratic phonological re-analyses of TRAP during a period of allophonic restructuring in Michigan English and (2) an apparent time analysis of pronunciation change in the infrequent variable post-tonic [tən] (as in button). I end with some discussion of our research framework and how other scholars can adapt it to their own uses. \n\n—\n\nBetsy Sneller: \nhttps://betsysneller.github.io/’s primary research interest is in language variation and change. Her dissertation work focused on the way that dramatic structural sound change (i.e., phonological change) is represented and produced by individual speakers during the change. She has used ethnography, corpora, and experimental methods to investigate how children acquire sociolinguistic and phonological variation. Dr. Sneller is the PI of the MI Diaries project, which collects audio recordings through a mobile app to investigate language change in Michigan, USA. Her work has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the US National Endowment for the Humanities."

Expanding their ability to compile, synthesize, and reason over large volumes of information on the fly will further unlock transformative applications, ranging from AI literature assistants to generative search engines. In this talk, I will present my research on advancing LMs for processing information at scale. (1) I will present my evaluation framework for LM-based information-seeking systems, emphasizing the importance of providing citations for verifying the model-generated answers. Our evaluation highlights shortcomings in LMs’ abilities to reliably process long-form texts (e.g., dozens of webpages), which I address by developing state-of-the-art long-context LMs that outperform leading industry efforts while using a small fraction of the computational budget. (2) I will then introduce my foundational work on using contrastive learning to produce high-performing text embeddings, which form the cornerstone of effective and scalable search. (3) In addition to building systems that can process large-scale information, I will discuss my contributions to creating efficient pre-training and customization methods for LMs, which enable scalable deployment of LM-powered applications across diverse settings. Finally, I will share my vision for the next generation of autonomous information processing systems and outline the foundational challenges that must be addressed to realize this vision.\n\n—\n\nTianyu Gao: https://gaotianyu.xyz/about/ is a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Danqi Chen.

        "description": "My doctoral research addresses two fundamental obstacles to beneficial outcomes from strategic interactions between multiple parties: strategic incentives against cooperation (as in the Prisoner's Dilemma) and the multiplicity of solutions (sometimes called the equilibrium selection problem). As AI systems are increasingly involved in consequential decision making processes on behalf of human principals, understanding how to achieve desirable outcomes in multi-agent AI settings becomes critical. My research leverages unique features of AI systems -- including their transparency, reproducibility, and malleability -- to develop novel game-theoretic approaches that enable better, more cooperative outcomes.\n    \nThree primary research directions form the core of this dissertation. First, the concept of safe Pareto improvements provides a rigorous framework for improving outcomes without resolving equilibrium selection problems. Unlike traditional solution concepts, safe Pareto improvements make qualitative assumptions about pairs of games rather than individual games. This sometimes allows us to prefer playing one game over another, without any judgment about how each of the individual games is played. Second, the concept of program equilibrium explores how the use of mutually transparent decision-making algorithms can allow for cooperation. Third, my research on so-called Newcomb-like decision problems takes inspiration from philosophical branches of decision theory. I investigate how cooperation can be achieved when different parties deploy similar AI systems.\n\nCurrent and planned work extends these directions through several projects, including: connecting program equilibrium with mediated equilibrium; exploring sequential program/mediated equilibrium-type settings; investigating the relationship between self-locating beliefs and decision theory; developing theoretical foundations for safe Pareto improvements, as well as analyzing safe Pareto improvements in a new setting. I've also started to implement some of these theoretical ideas in language models to test their practical applicability.\n\nThesis Committee\nVincent Conitzer (Chair)\nTuomas Sandholm\nFei Fang\nStuart Russell (University of California, Berkeley)\nBen Levinstein (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)\n\nAdditional Information: \nhttps://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/dissertation_proposal.pdf"

Resource analysis has numerous applications, including job scheduling in cloud computing and prevention of side-channel attacks. Two approaches to resource analysis are static analysis and data-driven analysis. Static analysis reasons about programs' behaviors by examining their source code. Data-driven analysis first runs programs on many inputs to collect cost measurements and then statistically analyzes this dataset.\n\nStatic and data-driven resource analyses have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Static analysis is sound: any cost bound successfully inferred is guaranteed to be a valid bound. However, static analysis is incomplete: every analysis technique has a program that it cannot handle. On the other hand, data-driven analysis can infer a candidate cost bound for any program. However, it does not guarantee soundness of inference results.\n\nIn this talk, I describe my recent work (PLDI 2024) on hybrid resource analysis, which integrates static and data-driven analyses. Given a program, the user first specifies which analysis techniques are applied to which code fragments. The two analyses are then performed on their respective code fragments. Finally, their inference results are combined into an overall cost bound of the program. Hybrid resource analysis retains the strengths of constituent analyses while mitigating their respective weaknesses.\n\nI start by introducing background on type-based resource analysis Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA). It automates the potential method from amortized analysis. I next introduce our first contribution: Bayesian data-driven resource analysis. Finally, I present Hybrid AARA, which integrates AARA and Bayesian data-driven analysis via a novel interface between linear programming and sample algorithms.\n\nJoint work with Feras Saad and Jan Hoffmann.\n\nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of the CSD Speaking Skills Requirement"

        "description": "Bringing the promise of quantum computation into reality requires not only building a quantum computer but also correctly programming it to run a quantum algorithm. To obtain asymptotic advantage over classical algorithms, quantum algorithms rely on the ability of data in quantum superposition to exhibit phenomena such as interference and entanglement. In turn, an implementation of the algorithm as a program must correctly orchestrate these phenomena in the states of qubits. Otherwise, the algorithm would yield incorrect outputs or lose its computational advantage.\n\nGiven a quantum algorithm, what are the challenges and costs to realizing it as a program that can run on a physical quantum computer? In this talk, I answer this question by showing how basic programming abstractions upon which many quantum algorithms rely - such as data structures and control flow - can fail to work correctly or efficiently on a quantum computer. I then show how we can leverage insights from programming languages to re-invent the software stack of abstractions, libraries, and compilers to meet the demands of quantum algorithms. This approach holds out a promise of expressive and efficient tools to program a quantum computer and practically realize its computational advantage.\n\n—\n\nCharles Yuan: \nhttps://www.csail.mit.edu/person/charles-yuan is a Ph.D. candidate at MIT CSAIL working with Prof. Michael Carbin.

        "description": "Shortly after the 1918 pandemic, the word “robot” was coined in a play about mechanical workers organizing a rebellion to defeat their human overlords. A century later, emerging advances in Artificial Intelligence and robotics, fueled by venture capital and governments, are disrupting labor, trade, and political stability. Claims about “superintelligence” and existential threats to humanity raise new questions about the essential distinctions between humans and machines.\n\nTo contextualize a series of his artworks that explore this boundary, Ken Goldberg references Sigmund Freud’s Uncanny (1919) and Masahiro Mori’s Uncanny Valley (1970). Ken will share robot paintings from his first art exhibit at CMU and art installations such as the Telegarden: \nhttps://goldberg.berkeley.edu/garden/Ars/ (1995-2004), a living garden tended by a robot operated by over 100,000 visitors over the Internet, and AlphaGarden (2020-), a fully automated garden that took an unexpected twist during the pandemic.\n\nKen will also present two new projects: Ancient Wisdom (2024), a collection of wooden sculptures addressing AI and ecology in the Getty Museum’s Pacific Standard Time exhibition in Los Angeles, and Breathless (2023), an 8-hour robot-human dance performance that premiered at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, NY.\n\n—\n\nKen Goldberg: \nhttps://goldberg.berkeley.edu/ is an artist, inventor, and UC Berkeley Professor. He is a Professor in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department, with secondary appointments in EECS, Art Practice, the School of Information, and Radiation Oncology at the UCSF Medical School. Ken is Director of the CITRIS \"People and Robots\" Initiative and the UC Berkeley AUTOLAB: https://autolab.berkeley.edu/ where he and his students pursue research in geometric algorithms and machine learning for robotics and automation in surgery, manufacturing, and other applications. Ken developed the first provably complete algorithms for part feeding and part fixturing and the first robot on the Internet. Despite agonizingly slow progress, Ken persists in trying to make robots less clumsy. He has over 200 peer-reviewed publications and eight U.S. Patents. He co-founded and served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. Ken's artwork has appeared in 70 exhibits including the Whitney Biennial and films he has co-written have been selected for Sundance and nominated for an Emmy Award. Ken was awarded the NSF PECASE (Presidential Faculty Fellowship) from President Bill Clinton in 1995, elected IEEE Fellow in 2005 and selected by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society for the George Saridis Leadership Award in 2016. He lives in the Bay Area and is madly in love with his wife, filmmaker and Webby Awards founder Tiffany Shlain, and their two daughters. \n\nKen earn his PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, his BSEE in Electrical Engineering, the University of Pennsylvania, and a BSE in Economics from UPenn-Wharton.
