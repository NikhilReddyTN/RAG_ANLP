Additionally, the Center has minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) filters of 13 and 14 in each of its air handlers; the CDC standard is MERV 13.

The convergence of the three rivers could take travelers the entire way to the Gulf of Mexico and was located on the tip of the frontier. Today, we’re still a traveler’s city. Conveniently located within 500 miles of nearly half the U.S. population and less than a 90-minute flight from nearly half of North America's population, planning a trip to Pittsburgh is easier than you may think.
