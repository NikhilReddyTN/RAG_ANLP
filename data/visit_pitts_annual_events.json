The previous years‚Äô events have hosted artwork, music, films, and performances from more than 700 participants. Planning MeetingsA group of dedicated volunteers meets over the span of three months leading up to the show to plan, organize and execute the show. New members are needed each year. If you are interested in contributing to Art All Night, join our team. Subscribe to the email list and/or follow all the social media feeds for details. Show Build OutJoin us in making the show a success! Volunteers are needed for setup tasks the month and especially the week leading up to the event. Build out is what it sounds like, volunteers build panels, stages, the areas for children‚Äôs activities and the live painters. Just show up with a cordless drill (if you have one) and you will be put to work. Registration & Drop OffThe morning of the show, before the event starts, hundreds of artists come to the location to drop off their art (and register it if they did not do that online at home). Rain or shine this happens from 10 am to 2pm sharp, so prepare according to the weather and don‚Äôt be late! The Show!The show usually occurs during the last weekend of April. It‚Äôs a uniquely packed 22 hours geared for all ages, an engaging event open to all. Come check it out anytime from 4pm on a Saturday to 2pm on Sunday. Experience creativity, community, and inspiration come to life. Don‚Äôt miss out! #ArtAllNightPittsburgh The AuctionAll the art that was created overnight at Art All Night by our onsite artist volunteers gets auctioned off at noon on Sunday. You could own your very own original Art All Night art and feel good about those proceeds going to fund future Art All Night events. Event TeardownAt 2 pm on Sunday the show shutters its doors and the task of restoring the building to its original state begins. Constructed panels and partitions need to be uninstalled, materials sorted and packed up. Volunteers do the important work of maintaining the Art All Night reputation of leaving buildings in the best condition. Consider being a part of this valuable volunteer team!"

Also, it only seems possible to star an artist for your √¢¬Ä¬úmy schedule√¢¬Ä¬ú on the schedule page, not on the list of acts themselves.
