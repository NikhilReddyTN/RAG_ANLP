        "content": "Biography  Andy Warhol, born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928, was the youngest of three sons born to Andrej Warhola and Julia Zavacky Warhola. His parents immigrated to the Unite d States from the European region that is now Slovakia, settling into the working-class neighborhood of Uptown in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Warhol graduated from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Fine Art in Pictorial Design in 1949 and soon after moved to New York City to pursue a career as a commercial artist.  Throughout the 1950s, he became one of the most successful illustrators of his time and won numerous awards for his work. His clients included Tiffany & Co.,The New York Times, I. Miller Shoes, Bonwit Teller, Columbia Records, Fleming-Joffe, NBC, and others. Much of his commercial work was based on photographs and other source images, a process he would use for the rest of his life. While he continued to work as a commercial artist throughout his career, in the early 60s Warhol transitioned into the fine art world, gaining notoriety in the nascent Pop Art movement. Early Pop paintings were based on comics and ads, with his series ofCampbell’s Soup Cansin 1962 creating a buzz in the art world that launched Warhol as a celebrity. Other early subjects drew upon Warhol’s life-long fascination with Hollywood and sensationalism; in 1962 he began a large series of celebrity portraits, including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Elizabeth Taylor. He also produced a series of “death and disaster” paintings at this time – canvases included images of electric chairs, suicides, and car crashes. Throughout his career Warhol continually explored different mediums to create art. In 1963 he began to make films, and created many classics of avant-garde cinema, includingSleep(1963),Empire(1964),Kiss(1963-64),The Chelsea Girls(1966), and a body of work known asScreen Tests(4-minute portrait films, from 1964-1966). He broadened his activities into the realm of performance art with a traveling multimedia show calledThe Exploding Plastic Inevitable, which featured the rock and roll band The Velvet Underground. Andy Warhol poses with a step guide.On June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas, a writer who had appeared in Warhol’s filmI, a Man(1967-68), came into the studio and shot Warhol in the chest, angered over a script she wrote and thought Warhol stole.  In the year following his recovery he co-foundedInterview, a magazine devoted to film, fashion, and popular culture that continues to this day.Interviewtestified to Warhol’s lifelong obsession with film stars and other contemporary celebrities. In 1974 Warhol started a series ofTime Capsules, cardboard boxes that he filled with the materials of his everyday life, including mail, photos, art, clothing, collectibles, etc. TheTime Capsulesnumber over 600 boxes, providing an intimate and detailed look at the artist’s life and process. Warhol accepted commission work as early as 1963, but portrait commissions became a significant source of output and income as he mixed further with New York’s high society circles. Whether captured in photographs or paintings, Warhol’s work blurred the lines between artist, socialite, and celebrity with his 70s and 80s work, capturing the images of everyone from Liza Minnelli, Halston, Grace Jones, Mick Jagger, and many others. In the mid-80s, Warhol collaborated on artworks with young artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. Warhol and Basquiat together produced over 150 collaborative canvases over a four-year period. In the mid-1980s his television shows,Andy Warhol’s TVandAndy Warhol’s Fifteen Minutes,aired on Madison Square Garden cable television and on MTV. In addition to his many portrait commissions, from the 1970s onward, Warhol’s solo output continued producing a prolific number of paintings, prints, photographs, and drawings. Series includingMao,Ladies and Gentlemen,Skulls,Oxidation, and many others, culminating in hisLast Supperpaintings, which were shown in Milan in early 1987. Warhol died in New York City on February 22, 1987, due to complications following surgery to remove his gall bladder. After Warhol’s death The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. was founded to promote the “advancement of visual arts.” The Andy Warhol Museum was announced in 1989 and opened in Pittsburgh in 1994.

Values Founding The Warhol is one of the four Carnegie Museums, and a collaborative project between Carnegie Institute, Dia Art Foundation, and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.

Originally built in 1911 as a distribution center for products sold to mills and mines, The Warhol was redesigned by architect Richard Gluckman and features seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground level that houses The Factory education studio and the conservation lab.

        "content": "Publications The Warhol works with curators, artists, and scholars to produce exhibition catalogues and scholarly publications that illuminate contemporary culture. KAWS + Warhol A never-before-seen look at the striking thematic parallels between KAWS and Andy Warhol, two of the most iconic artists of our time As celebrated artists that draw from popular culture, KAWS and Andy Warhol are known for creating art that is approachable beyond the confines of the traditional art world. While at first glance, both artists’ works often appear celebratory and joyful, they share a number of dark common threads beneath the surface: tragedy as spectacle and meditations on death and dying. When these two bold bodies of work are juxtaposed, that connection is made explicit and powerful. This book highlights the artistic intersection of KAWS and Warhol, featuring their takes on death and disaster, advertising, nostalgia, abstraction, skulls, and self-portraiture. Accompanying a major exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum that will travel internationally, it presents some of the most standout and analogous works from two of the most popular artists of all time. Foreword by Patrick Moore, with an interview by Laurie Simmons and essays by Thomas Crow and Marianne Dobner  Published by Monacelli, a Phaidon company, 2024 $69.95 Marisol and Warhol Take New York This book charts the emergence of Marisol Escobar (1930–2016) and Andy Warhol (1928–87) in New York during the dawn of Pop art in the early 1960s. Through essays, interviews, and prose, the book explores the artists’ parallel rise to success, the formation of their artistic personas, their savvy navigation of gallery relationships, and the blossoming of their early artistic practices from 1960 to 1968. The exhibition features key loans of Marisol’s work from major global collections, along with iconic works and rarely seen films and archival materials from The Andy Warhol Museum’s collection. By situating Marisol's work in dialogue with Warhol’s, this new collection of writing seeks to reclaim the importance of her art; reframe the strength, originality, and daring nature of her work; and reconsider her as one of the leading figures of the Pop era. Edited by Jessica Beck. Text by Angie Cruz, Jeffrey Deitch, Eleanor Friedberger, Jennifer Josten, Franklin Sirmans.  Published by The Andy Warhol Museum, 2021 $45 Fantasy America Originally published in 1985, Warhol’sAmericafeatures photographs both taken and collected by the artist during his cross-country travels and in-person encounters over the previous decade. The book, an idiosyncratic love letter to America, finds Warhol reflecting on everything from travel, beauty, and fame to politics, technology, and the American Dream. Three decades later,Fantasy Americainvites artists Nona Faustine, Kambui Olujimi, Pacifico Silano, Naama Tsabar, and Chloe Wise to revisit this seminal publication and contribute their own art. All New York–based, they, like Warhol, are cross-disciplinary artists drawn to repetition, seriality, and image appropriation in their work. Foreword by Alan Pelaez Lopez.

Since Clerkin formed the experimental trio with Patrick Benjamin and Sunny-Joe Paradisos in 2020, they have been cultivating their unique hybrid aesthetic that combines elements of folk, dub, and psychedelia, as part of Bristol’s underground music scene. In a review in The Wire, the band is described sonically as, “Drifting from dubby minimalism to smudged acid jazz, Tara’s stark and tuneful voice acts as the vehicle for her concise poetic lyricism. The group coalesce disparate influences into a cohesive sound, reflecting a romantic view of a familiar world.” They visit the intimate Warhol theater just after their appearance at the acclaimed Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee.Pittsburgh-based cellist, Ricki Weidenhof, opens the evening.

As a lifelong artist and educator, as well as an experienced arts administrator, programmer, and community convener, I am thrilled to return to my hometown of Pittsburgh as the new director of The Andy Warhol Museum. The Warhol was actually my very first job (in 1997) after graduating from college and I have such fond and strong memories of the museum, with Warhol’s life and work having a powerful impact on my approach to artmaking, teaching, and collaborating. Watching visitors’ eyes widen with growing understanding of Andy’s art as I demonstrated the silk screening process; seeing the unexpected connections being made by out-of-town visitors as they discovered an unknown detail of Warhol’s background that resonated with their own stories; anticipating the unveiling of aTime Capsule’scontents; imagining the interplay between Warhol, Basquiat, and Clemente on their collaborative pieces; and taking original “selfies” in a photobooth–all are memories that fuel my passion for serving in this new role. I am excited to honor the good work of the amazing Warhol staff and leadership and build upon that legacy as we look to leverage Warhol’s resonance for future growth and engagement with returning and new audiences. With such a breadth of programming, including the Sound Series, Youth Invasion, the film & video collection, on-going archivist work, the exhibition program (from 2001’sPopular CultureSthat impacted me directly to the currentKAWS + Warholexhibition), the stellar learning and public engagement programs, as well as the new Pop District initiative–The Warhol Museum family has much to celebrate, learn from, and build upon. Upon my arrival back in Pittsburgh at the end of March, I’m planning to dedicate the first few months to listening to and learning from the community in order to inform future strategy and direction for The Warhol. From current staff, advisory board members, artists, donors, and partners to local community members, youth, and Pittsburgh leaders, I am looking forward to hearing their feedback and honoring their voices as we craft our future vision together. Drawing upon my experience as an early visual art educator, my work as director of arts for Chicago Public Schools, my leadership of the vast education portfolio at the Kennedy Center, and most recently serving a broad national audience as the executive director of the National Art Education Association (NAEA), I’m confident that my skills in developing successful creative programming, building strategy, collaborating and convening the community, as well as leveraging innovative practices will serve The Warhol and Pittsburgh community well.  –   Mario Rossero, Director, The Andy Warhol Museum   Related events Meet Mario, the new director of The Warhol Friday, March 14, 2025,5–8 p.m. Left:Mario Rossero,Self-Portrait, 2004Right:Mario Rossero,Self-Portrait, 2019 More about the museum Footer Address Additional Resources Additional Resources Social Links"

        "content": "Notice of Compliance with Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, and the ADA Policy on Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 Title IX Compliance Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (CMP) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in its educational programs, activities, and employment practices. Prohibited conduct includes all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, violence, assault, dating violence, domestic violence, interpersonal violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation. This policy prohibits sex discrimination or harassment against all CMP employees and all students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, including: employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals. Title VI, Section 504, and Age Discrimination Act Compliance CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, on the basis of age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law. CMP also prohibits retaliation against someone for reporting prohibited conduct. This policy requires CMP to: 1) investigate reports of prohibited conduct under this policy, 2) establish formal and informal grievance procedures to ensure a fair process, and 3) appoint Coordinators. Inquiries or complaints related to this policy should be directed to CMP’s Department of Human Resources at HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org or 412-622-3311. Anyone who violates this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Role and Responsibilities of the CMP Coordinators CMP has designated a Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, and ADA Coordinator (“Coordinator”). Additionally, CMP has designated a Deputy Coordinator for each museum component and central services department and for its students. The Coordinator is responsible for: 1) ensuring CMP complies with and carries out its responsibilities under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, and its implementing regulations; 2) educating the museum community about how to file a complaint and the investigation process; and 3) overseeing the implementation of this policy, grievance procedures, and the investigation process. All questions or complaints may be referred to the Coordinators at the Department of Human Resources. General contact information for the office is below. Information about specific personnel for each component within the office can be found in CMP’s grievance procedure within this policy, entitled “Reporting Procedure for Sex Discrimination & Harassment.” Coordinators can be reached at the Department of Human Resources, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, 4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, 412-622-3311, HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org. The CMP Coordinator is: Scope of Policy This policy supplements CMP’s other anti-discrimination and harassment policies for persons covered by the terms of this policy. Prohibited Conduct Defined – Harassment and Discrimination Sex Harassment and Discrimination All CMP employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing CMP employees and students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities under this policy based on that individual’s sex or gender (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and regardless of the harasser’s sex or gender. Sexual harassment means any harassment based on someone’s sex or gender. It includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual’s sex or gender), as well as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or visuals, or any other conduct that is of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment includes various forms of offensive behavior based on sex. Examples of prohibited conduct can be found in CMP’s policy on “Sexual & Other Unlawful Harassment.” Other Harassment or Discrimination Under this policy, CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment by employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs on the basis of that student’s age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law.

Reporting Procedure for Discrimination & Harassment CMP encourages any CMP employee or student covered by this policy who believes they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation under this policy, or who are aware of any such conduct against others, to immediately provide a written or verbal report to the Department of Human Resources Coordinators. Each CMP component has a primary Coordinator along with deputy coordinators, whose information is contained in this policy. Complaints may also be made to the Department of Human Resources by email at HRConnect@CarnegieMuseums.org.

Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent practical and permitted by law. Investigations will be conducted as confidentially as possible and related information will only be shared with others on a need-to-know basis. Those involved in such investigations are required to be truthful, accurate, and cooperative throughout the investigation process. Those who report misconduct are known as complainants. Those against whom a complaint is lodged are known as respondents. Complaints should be as detailed as possible and include a description of the complained of conduct, the names of all individuals involved as well as any witnesses, and the dates on which the complained of conduct occurred. If discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment, will be taken. CMP may also report conduct to law enforcement, as appropriate. Initial Assessment The Coordinator will conduct an initial assessment of any reported conduct. As part of the assessment, the Coordinator will, among other things: consider the expressed resolution preferences by the reporting party; assess the circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct; address any immediate physical and emotional safety concerns; notify the reporting party of their right to contact law enforcement if warranted by the circumstances; provide the reporting party with information about the procedural options available under this policy; assess for pattern evidence by the respondent; and explain CMP’s policy prohibiting retaliation. Following the initial assessment, the Coordinator will determine whether this policy is implicated and whether an informal or formal resolution is appropriate and articulate those conclusions to the complainant. CMP strives to assess, investigate, and resolve all reports of potential misconduct under this policy within sixty (60) days. Resolution and Investigation Procedures Informal Resolution CMP’s informal resolution process aims to appropriately investigate and, if necessary, address alleged misconduct without requiring a formal resolution process described below. Under an informal resolution process, a complainant reports alleged misconduct under this policy to the Coordinator. The Coordinator will give notice to the respondent of the alleged misconduct and may gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the Coordinator may gather additional information by meeting with relevant witnesses (identified by either the Coordinator or the complainant and respondent) and collecting any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party may be heard throughout the informal resolution process. CMP strives to complete any informal resolution process within thirty (30) days; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. Following an investigation, the Coordinator may or may not then impose sanctions or other disciplinary action as appropriate. Neither party may appeal an informal resolution once final. Formal Resolution If the Coordinator deems a formal resolution to be appropriate, CMP will begin the formal resolution process described in this sub-section. CMP strives to complete any formal resolution process within sixty (60) days excluding any appeals; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. During an investigation, both complainants and respondents may have an appropriate advisor who may observe any hearings or interviews as well as provide support, guidance, and advice during an investigation. The Coordinator will begin or continue an investigation by providing written notice to each party that an investigation has begun and will also appoint an investigator. The appointed investigator may be a CMP Coordinator that will not formally adjudicate the complaint or external appointed investigator appointed at CMP’s sole discretion. The appointed investigator will gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the investigator may conduct other fact-finding by meeting with relevant witnesses and gathering any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party is entitled to be heard throughout the investigation process. Following the investigation, the investigator will submit a written report summarizing the facts and outlining areas of agreement and disagreement between the parties. The report may redact irrelevant or prejudicial information as necessary. The Coordinator will then share the report with each party, allowing them time to review. A party has five (5) days to review the report and submit responses for consideration into the final report. Once a report is finalized, the investigator will determine whether the respondent is responsible for the alleged misconduct. The investigator will use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard and inquire whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of misconduct. Upon this determination, the investigator will recommend adjudicatory action and sanctions to the Coordinator, including, but not limited to: a warning letter, suspension, expulsion, termination, or a no contact order. The Coordinator will then formally adjudicate through a written letter to each party notifying them of the outcome. Either party has the right to appeal the adjudicatory action letter submitted by the Coordinator. A party must appeal the letter in writing within ten (10) days and must state one of three limited grounds: 1) a procedural error which materially affected the outcome of the investigation; 2) the existence of new information unavailable to the investigators during the investigation which could have materially affected the outcome; or 3) the recommendation of the investigators and/or adjudicatory action taken by the Coordinator was clearly erroneous based on the evidence gathered during the investigation. Appeals must be heard by an Appeal Officer. The Appeal Officer may be any Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator not involved in the original proceeding. The Appeal Officer will review the findings of fact, investigation record, investigator recommendations, and adjudication letter to determine whether the appealed decision should be affirmed or reversed. The Appeal Officer must submit a written determination within fifteen (15) days of an appeal.  ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh"

        "content": "Holding Still, Holding On March 14 – April 21, 2025 Photograph by the Carnegie Mellon School of Art MFA Class of 2025 For the first time, The Warhol and Carnegie Mellon University School of Art MFA Program co-present a joint exhibition. Holding Still, Holding Onlaunches an exciting new series spotlighting theMFA programfrom the school where Andy Warhol earned his degree in pictorial design in 1949 (then the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University). Holding Still, Holding Onfeatures new works by the CMU School of Art MFA Class of 2025—Frankmarlin, Izsys Archer, Tingting Cheng, Chantal Feitosa-Desouza, and Max Tristan Watkins. The exhibition spans wide-ranging media and highlights the distinct perspectives of these five artists as they complete their final year of study. Presented in The Warhol’s rotating exhibition gallery, the exhibition offers a dynamic exploration of contemporary artmaking. The featured artists inHolding Still, Holding Oneach employ diverse approaches to storytelling, through mediums including photography, painting, archival assemblage, sculptural installations, text, sound, and film. Their works collectively explore the intersections of memory, place, and belonging, together revealing art’s unique capacity to hold and transform complex personal and collective histories. The Carnegie Mellon University School of Art MFA Program is an interdisciplinary, experimental, research-based program that provides students with a challenging and supportive context to expand and develop their work and thinking as artists. As one of the top-ranked graduate programs in the country, the school views artmaking as a vital social, critical, and intellectual pursuit. Graduate students are encouraged to employ a comparative and intersectional approach to critical and cultural theories, and to allow this inquiry to inform and expand what it means to be an artist and to make art within the contemporary condition. Contributing Artists Izsys Archer Instagram:@Izsys Izsys Archer is a self-proclaimedSpace Taker-Upperoriginally from Lafayette, Indiana. She graduated with a BFA in photography from the Kansas City Art Institute. Within her practice, she explores her intrinsic need to create through physical, digital, and ritualistic spaces of the Archive. Perpetual self-portraiture becomes a performance of identity as she interrogates notions of domesticity, memory, and Black iconography to wander on a journey of self-actualization and representation. Archer was a Durwood Intern, in which she focused on curation and research at H&R Block Artspace in Kansas City, Missouri. She has shown work at Haw Contemporary and co-curated exhibitions at Leedy-Voulkos Arts Center. While in Pittsburgh, Izsys has been a BOOM Universe Resident and currently a part of 1Hood Media’s Artivist Academy Cohort. Tingting Chen Website:tingtingcheng.comInstagram:@Tingting_Cut Tingting Cheng is a cross-media artist whose oeuvre is deeply informed by the ritualistic traditions of the Chu state and the cultural hybridity shaped by globalization. Working across diverse media, she mobilizes cultural archives as forms of “contemporary witchcraft,” integrating natural, synthetic, and vernacular materials to cultivate ritualistic engagement with audiences while subverting commodification. In her exploration of appropriation and the semiotics of advertising, Cheng incorporates elements such as detritus, propaganda imagery, anime, and conspiracy discourses to scrutinize mechanisms of influence and dissemination. By synthesizing poetic and political dimensions, Cheng critiques consumerist ideologies, explores relational poetics, and engages with techno-animism. Cheng received her BFA from the Hubei Institute of Fine Arts, where she was honored with the K11 Emerging Artist Jury’s Special Recommendation Award in 2021. Her work has also been supported by The Sylvia and David Steiner Film Fund in Carnegie Mellon University. Chantal Feitosa-Desouza Website:chantalfeitosa.comInstagram:@ChantalFeitosa Chantal Feitosa-Desouza is a Brazilian United Statesian from Queens, New York. She is a filmmaker, a learner, and a facilitator of workshops and public events beyond the traditional classroom setting. Her practice is guided by the visual process of collage and its potential to create new histories from found fragments. Her work is always proposing slower methods of thinking, remembering, and storytelling for an audience. Chantal received her BFA in film/animation/video from Rhode Island School of Design with a concentration in literary arts & studies in 2018. Her work has screened at locations including Bodega Film Festival, Harlem International Film Festival, Vidlings & Tapeheads, and Silver Eye Center for Photography. She was an artist in residence at the Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Residency Unlimited, and Smack Mellon. Frankmarlin Website:frankmarlinsantos.comInstagram:@Frankmartian In his practice, Frankmarlin takes a look into the invisible, sees beyond what is presented and asks questions he doesn’t know the answers to. With a sense of urgency, his works explore themes of erasure, lineage, surveillance, healing, and the beauty of mundane Black experiences. Frankmarlin, graduated with a BFA in studio arts from Kutztown University in 2020. Throughout his life, he’s made messes, spoke when spoken to, and danced to bring his family joy in moments of sorrow. Max Tristan Watkins Website:maxtristanwatkins.cargo.siteInstagram:@MaxTristanWatkins Max Tristan Watkins is an artist and writer born in Canterbury in the UK. His practice draws from various historical tools of control and their absurdities. Currently, he is interested in the European early-modern book as an information technology. With a literary sensibility that favors quotation, citation, trope, and idiom, he takes pleasure in following rabbit holes and constructing webs of footnotes. At the center of his work is the precise absence of something unarticulated, gestured towards and acted out in miniature, euphemism, or parable. His prints, paintings, and books often toy with ideas of the body double, the facsimile, or the absent original. A subject he returns to often is the disjointed, open(ed) or chimeric body – and its misrepresentations in taxonomies, anatomies, and histories. Max received his BFA from the University of Oxford, where he was a Waugh Scholar, Stuart Morgan Prize winner, and Gibbs prize winner. His work has been supported by the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry and the Douglas “Wrong Way” Corrigan Research Fellowship. He is a current Tomayko Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University and will be the recipient of a Maker-Creator Fellowship at Winterthur Museum in 2025. About the School of Art The Carnegie Mellon School of Art is the premier location for theinterface between art, technology, and interdisciplinary art practice.

Email:membership@carnegiemuseums.orgMail:Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh4400 Forbes AvenuePittsburgh, PA  15213Attention: Membership  Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Online Privacy Policy Last Updated January 3, 2022 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (“Carnegie Museums” or “us” or “we” or “our”) own and operate a number of web sites and mobile applications including but not limited to the carnegiemuseums.org, cmoa.org, carnegiesciencecenter.org, carnegiemnh.org, and warhol.org web sites (the “Sites”). This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to information collected by Carnegie Museums through the Sites, through any other online location where this Policy is published, and through our other interactions with you, including but not limited to, via mail, telephone, email, online transactions, online programming and onsite visits at our museums or to Carnegie Museums programs, exhibits or events at other locations (collectively with the Sites, the “Services”). This Policy only applies to information that you provide or we collect from you through the Services identified above. Other web sites, mobile applications, and online services, including any third-party services you use to interact with Carnegie Museums, may have their own privacy policies and you should consult those policies accordingly. Policy Changes Carnegie Museums reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. Since this Policy may change as we modify or expand our Services, we suggest you check back from time to time in order to understand how we currently handle your information. Our Policy’s effective date will always be set forth at the beginning and end of the Policy. Any changes will be immediately incorporated into this Policy. Any change to this Policy is effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any changes are made to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If any changes are unacceptable to you, you are no longer authorized to use the Services and should cease all such use. The Information We Collect Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is generally defined as information that, by itself or in combination with other information, is reasonably capable of being linked to a specific individual. Depending on how you interact with Carnegie Museums, there are certain aspects of the Services where we will only collect Personal Information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide, and other aspects of the Services provided through the Sites where we may automatically collect data from you, including your Internet Protocol address (IP address), cookies, and other online identifiers that may include portions of Personal Information through the use of tracking technology (see the “Information Collected Automatically” section, below). For example, Personal Information you voluntarily provide to the Carnegie Museums may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, username and password, age/birthdate, credit/debit card number or other payment information, photograph, image, voice, likeness or other identifiable characteristics, office address and other business or organizational information, or any other type of data that, directly or indirectly, is reasonably capable of being associated with someone. You may be asked to provide such Personal Information to Carnegie Museums when you: Carnegie Museums generally will not ask you to provide any sensitive data, such as your religious beliefs, citizenship status, sexual orientation, or your race or ethnicity, but you may be able to voluntarily provide such sensitive data in content that you upload, post or otherwise provide on or through the Services. To the extent you voluntarily make any sensitive data available through the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such data may be processed by Carnegie Museums as necessary to provide the Services in accordance with your instructions. Information Collected Automatically There are areas of the Sites where Carnegie Museums or our service providers may automatically collect certain data as you use the Sites and navigate elsewhere online, such as your IP address and other data about your Internet connection, your operating system, browser type, and other services or equipment you use to access the Sites, and usage data about your interaction with our Sites. This automatically collected data generally does not identify any specific individual, but to the extent such data is reasonably capable of identifying you or another person, we will treat such data as Personal Information. This automatically collected information may include data on how you use our Sites, what pages you have visited, or any errors that occurred while you were visiting our Sites. This information may be used by Carnegie Museums to help us in developing content and improving our Sites to create the best experience for our visitors. The technology used to automatically collect this information may utilize cookies, which are small files sent to your browser by our Sites when you visit. Cookies can be used to track usage patterns, trends and visitor behavior, as well as to record other information regarding your visit. These cookies may allow us to share information with our trusted advertising partners which enables us to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms based on your previous interactions with our Sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change the preference on your browser to reject them. Doing so however, may affect your ability to use certain features of our Sites. We may also use third-party analytics providers which could automatically collect certain Personal Information and other data about you through the Sites including, but not limited to, your IP address and/or other online identifiers. Third-party cookies or other tracking technology may be used through this process to track data such as the times you most frequently use the Sites, what devices you use to access the Services, what parts of the Services you visit and the links you use to get there. These data and analytics service providers may use such information to track how you use the Services, measure the performance of the Services, improve features on the Services, and provide Carnegie Museums with tools that satisfy overall operating needs for the Services. Carnegie Museums may then use feedback from these service providers to improve the Services and our interactions with you. All of the above-referenced IP addresses and other data will be collected in an automated manner and we may maintain that information or associate it with certain other data, which may include Personal Information you provide voluntarily through the Services. This helps us improve our Services, deliver better and more personalized Services, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and store information about your preferences. How We Use Your Information Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to appropriately respond to your requests and to provide a variety of Services. Personal Information regarding your interests will allow us to provide materials to meet your specific needs. Museum personnel may, for example, use the Personal Information to customize offers, target communications through mail and email, and to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms.  More specifically, Carnegie Museums may use your Personal Information and other data to: Carnegie Museums or its designees may, from time to time, compile statistics on visitors to our museums and Sites and/or work with others compiling statistics or performing other quantitative analysis. In these situations, data that Carnegie Museums has related to your interactions with the Services may be used to aggregate statistical information to analyze visitor interest or other aspects of non-profit organization-related activities. The information aggregated will not include any Personal Information as it relates to a single visitor. Sharing Information Carnegie Museums may share certain portions of Personal Information with vendors that help provide certain Services on behalf of Carnegie Museums in order to make the Services function properly. This may include sharing certain kinds of Personal Information, including without limitation, your credit card, debit card or other payment information, and/or your voice, likeness and any other Personal Information you make available in connection with Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other Services with: Under certain circumstances, we may trade or exchange contact information such as your mailing and email addresses among other Personal Information you provide during registration processes online, over the phone, or in-person at our museum locations, with reputable third-party museums and other cultural organizations that are not related to Carnegie Museums. If you do not want your information to be provided to such third-party organizations in connection with this activity, please contact us atmembership@carnegiemuseums.orgor call us at 412.622.3314. You also can review the “Your Choices” section, below, for other details on how you may be able to request changes regarding Carnegie Museums’ handling of Personal Information it maintains about you. As stated above, Carnegie Museums may use video conference service providers when providing virtual learning programs or other online events. When registering for such online Services, please review any information made available about the video conference service provider for the applicable program or event, including that provider’s privacy policy, for more details about how that provider may handle the Personal Information or other data it collects from you. Other third parties, such as social media platforms and other providers of services that rely on user generated content may be able to collect certain data that could include your Personal Information over time and across different online services when you interact with the Sites and other online Services. If at any time it becomes reasonably necessary, we will release the Personal Information and other data Carnegie Museums maintains about you if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or in cooperation with a government or law enforcement investigation, to comply with a court order, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Carnegie Museums, its personnel, the users of its Services, or others. Personal Information received or held by Carnegie Museums may be transferred if our ownership status changes. Under such circumstances, Carnegie Museums will make reasonable efforts to cause any successor to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. We also may disclose your Personal Information to other service providers to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts related to your use of the Services, or as otherwise described to you at or before the point when we collect your Personal Information. As a donor, member, and visitor of the Carnegie Museums, as a user of the Sites or our other Services, and by providing to or otherwise allowing Carnegie Museums to collect the Personal Information and other data referenced above, you agree, without limitation or qualification, that Carnegie Museums may process such Personal Information and other data in accordance with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Again, please check back periodically for changes to this Policy. Your Choices Depending on where you are and how you use our Services such as, for example, if you participate in our membership program, you may be able to ask questions or make certain choices with respect to Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you. For example, in some situations you may be able to request (subject to applicable legal exceptions): In addition, depending on where you are when you use our Services, you may submit requests regarding Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you, such as requests to: If at any time you would like to request the ability to edit or delete any Personal Information Carnegie Museums may have about you, opt-out of receiving further information from Carnegie Museums, limit what we share, or if you otherwise wish to ask Carnegie Museums to cease using your Personal Information in the manners specified in this Policy (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), please call the Membership Office at 412.622.3314 or send us an email using the addressmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Carnegie Museums is required to try to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information. If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, Carnegie Museums will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Information we store about you before responding to your request. If more information is needed to verify your identity in certain situations, Carnegie Museums may deny your request or ask for more details as necessary to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure and deletion. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, nor does it guarantee that we will be able to process your request. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. The Carnegie Museums reserve the right to refuse any request made regarding your Personal Information if we are unable to process the request for any reason, such as if we are unable to verify the identity of the person making the request or if we cannot authenticate the legitimacy of the request using reasonable efforts. Carnegie Museums is under no obligation or duty to verify the legitimacy of any request regarding Personal Information. Any removal of content by Carnegie Museums does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. Carnegie Museums will do our best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Information from the specified uses. Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request. If the request relates to information Carnegie Museums needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward. Carnegie Museums reserve the right to maintain proper records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from the Carnegie Museums, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send us a detailed email atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell web sites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. The Sites are not currently configured to respond to “do not track” or similar automated privacy controls. To learn more about ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that occur when you browse the Internet generally and may lead to targeted advertising, visit theNetwork Advertising Initiative web siteand theDigital Advertising Alliance web site. Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that certain third parties may receive information through the Services. Since some of these third parties may respond differently than Carnegie Museums to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information. Information Security To protect your Personal Information, Carnegie Museums uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information and other data stored on or through our Services. Personal Information provided to or collected by Carnegie Museums is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information and other data that could include your Personal Information by placing it on a secure portion of our Sites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of Carnegie Museums. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information. The transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Carnegie Museums, for example. Therefore, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Sites. If you are concerned about sending information to Carnegie Museums online, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. Carnegie Museums is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online. Carnegie Museums retains collected information for as long as needed to fulfill the stated purpose for which the Personal Information was collected or otherwise processed, and thereafter for a variety of legitimate purposes in support of Carnegie Museums and our Services. Carnegie Museums also will retain collected information connected to organizational records for periods of time required or permitted by law. These may include retention periods that are: (1) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations that apply to Carnegie Museums’ operations; (2) for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or (3) needed to maintain adequate and accurate organizational records.  If Carnegie Museums determines that information is no longer needed and no legal obligation to retain such data exists, it will delete such information. Our record-keeping times will be consistent with applicable law. If you have any questions about the security or retention of your Personal Information, please contact us. Children’s Information Carnegie Museums may collect certain Personal Information from teenagers who are between 13-18 years old and qualify to receive free access to the Carnegie Museums and our Services through our Teen Membership program. We will use this Personal Information to introduce teens who enroll in the program to our museum locations and Services, to organize events and tours related to the Teen Membership program, to provide transportation to such events and tours, and to partner with community-based organizations that serve teens. The Sites are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, individuals under 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 is authorized to use the Sites, and minors younger than 13 are not permitted to provide any information on or through the Sites without the verified consent of any such minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If you are under 13 years of age, DO NOT: use or provide any information on or through the Sites; use any of the Sites’ features; use any interactive or public commenting feature on the Sites or through other online Services; and/or provide any information about yourself to Carnegie Museums. Carnegie Museums does not and will not knowingly collect or request any information, including Personal Information, from any person under 18 years of age without the consent of the minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If Carnegie Museums learns that we have received Personal Information from any person under 18 years of age without the appropriate consent of the minor’s parent(s) or guardian(s), Carnegie Museums will delete that information. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18, and would like to enroll your child in Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other online Services, believe your child may have used or uploaded or posted information through the Sites inadvertently or without authorization, and such information is publicly available, or if you believe Carnegie Museums might otherwise have information from or about any person under 13 years of age, please contact us immediately atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. International Use and Transfers If you are outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with any local laws regarding your use of the Services, and any related data collection. You also agree and acknowledge that by providing any data through the Services, including Personal Information, that such information may be transmitted to, and stored in, the United States. If you are in the European Economic Area (the “EEA,” which includes the 27 European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (collectively, the “EU”) when you use our Services,  or if you use our Services from other regions with laws governing the collection, use and transfer of Personal Information across international borders, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and processing globally. By providing your information, you hereby agree to permit any transfer and processing by Carnegie Museums in accordance with this Policy. If you are located in the EU, then with the exception of uses for which we have obtained your consent, your Personal Information is processed to perform our obligations under a contract with you or another organization on behalf of which we are providing Services, or where the processing is in support of our legitimate interests as described in this Policy and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms under any data protection laws and regulations that may be applicable. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), individuals in the EU also may have the right to lodge a complaint about Carnegie Museums’ processing of your Personal Information with a supervisory authority. In particular, such individuals may lodge a complaint in the EU Member State where they live or work or where the alleged violation took place. Your Personal Information may be disclosed to and processed by staff operating in the United States. Disclosure will be to individuals who work for Carnegie Museums and organizations with which we have contracted to process or store this data on Carnegie Museums’ behalf. The entities that receive Personal Information as a result of international transfers are required to follow our instructions with respect to the use of Personal Information and comply with appropriate security measures to protect your information. External Links The Services may contain links to external web sites or other online services, including those embedded in third-party advertisements or sponsor information, which are not controlled by Carnegie Museums. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and data collection policies for such third-party services. You should consult the privacy policies of those third-party services for details. Carnegie Museums may also allow interaction between our Services and other third-party services online, including social media providers. This interaction may include plugins that allow you to share information with persons outside of the Services. Please consult the privacy policies of such third-party providers before using them to make sure you are comfortable with the level of sharing.
