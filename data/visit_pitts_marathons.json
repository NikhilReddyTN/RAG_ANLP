        "content": "Rachel Carson Trail Challenge — Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy NavigationSearch SiteAdvanced Search… History Rachel Carson Trail ChallengeHike the trail in one day!https://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/events/challengehttps://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/@@site-logo/RCTClogo.svgRachel Carson Trail ChallengeHike the trail in one day!Overview The twenty-eighth annual Rachel Carson Trail Challenge will take place on June 21, 2025, the Saturday of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. The Challenge is a 37-mile long, one-day, sunrise to sunset endurance hike on nearly the entire rugged Rachel Carson Trail. Unlike a footrace, the \"challenge\" is not to win, but to endure, to finish the hike in one day. This time, the Challenge starts in Harrison Hills Park at sunrise and ends 37 miles later in North Park. The deadline for finishing is sunset, 8:54 PM or 15 hours 4 minutes, whichever comes first.If 37 miles sounds too daunting, we offer two shorter events that same day. The first is the Homestead Challenge, an 19-mile hike from near the Rachel Carson Homestead. The second is a 7-mile Friends & Family Challenge from Hartwood Acres Park. All events finish in North Park.The Course The Challenge has two dimensions: the first is to endure mile upon mile of tortuous hill climbing and descent in unpredictable weather conditions; the second is to stay on the trail without getting lost. Obviously, those who have hiked the trail before will have some advantage in maintaining the proper route. (Training hikes covering various sections and the entire trail are held beforehand).The Rachel Carson Trail is a \"primitive\" trail in the sense that no special grading or surfacing materials are used. While the trail is blazed with yellow blazes, there will be an occasional missing blaze where a tree has fallen or when you are following a logging road, a power line or gas line; there will be blow downs, washouts, poison ivy, nettles, bugs, loose gravel and rocks, gullies, and wet stream crossings. There are no switchbacks on the trail; all hills  some are quite steep  are traversed directly up and down. You must be prepared to expect the unexpected and think the unthinkable. The better hiker you are, the better you will do on the Challenge. All hikers will be given a course guide to assist them on their journey. There will be four checkpoints throughout the hike, offering water, Gatorade, various snacks, and basic first aid. Hikers are expected to carry all their own gear and necessities, including snacks, water, first aid and raingear. The Challenge entry fee includes a t-shirt, shuttle bus, checkpoint support, cookout, and a course guide. The shuttle bus is available to take participants from the finish to check-in just before sunrise, and again later in the afternoon to take those finishers who parked at the start back to their vehicles.Registration The registration process for the 2025 Challenge will open on March 1, 2025. See the Challenge 2025 page for event details. VolunteersThe Challenge needs volunteers on Challenge Day! We will need people throughout the day, from morning registration to checkpoints and sweeps along the trail to the finish. People can volunteer for as few as two hours. If you'd like to help out, review the Volunteer Roles and Responsibilities and sign up!Forum Discuss, comment on, or ask questions about the Challenge on the Conservancy Facebook page.Past Events2024 Challenge: \"Withering Heat Bests Hikers\" | Images | Split Times2023 Challenge: \"Boomers Keep Booming\" | Images | Split Times2022 Challenge: \"Where's the Heat?\" | Images | Split Times2021 Challenge: \"There Are Limits, and Then There Are Limits\" | Images | Split Times2020 Challenge: Not held (pandemic)2019 Challenge: \"A Decade of Mud\" | Images | Split Times2018 Challenge: \"Discomfort Zone\" | Images | Split Times2017 Challenge: \"A Mini Mudfest\" | Images | Split Times2016 Challenge: \"A Typical Challenge\" | Images | Split Times2015 Challenge: \"A Mudfest for the Ages\" | Images | Split Times2014 Challenge: \"The Challenge Yin and Yang\" | Images | Split Times2013 Challenge: \"The Suffering Will End\" | Images | Split Times2012 Challenge: \"It's a Test\" | Images | Split Times2011 Challenge: \"It's a Personal Journey\" | Images | Split Times2010 Challenge: \"Down a Notch\" | Images | Split Times2009 Challenge: \"Rain and Shine\" | Images | Split Times2008 Challenge: \"Just An Adventure\" | Images | Split Times2007 Challenge: \"An Amazing Day\" | Images | Split Times2006 Challenge: \"And miles to go before I sleep\" | Images | Split Times2005 Challenge: \"The Many Paths to the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge\" | Letters | Images | Split Times2004 Challenge: \"The Slip 'n Slide\" | Letters | Images | Split Times2003 Challenge: \"Mudapalooza '03\" | Letters | Images | Split Times2002 Challenge: \"Hikers Finally Conquer the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge\" | Images | Split Times2001 Challenge: \"Mud Pie Challenge\" | Images | Split Times2000 Challenge: \"Whew...!
