    "content": "Music by Giacomo Puccini Libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa His escape is her cage. In this groundbreaking new production created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect. Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real. Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy."

    "venue": "BITZ OPERA FACTORY",
    "content": "Music by Jennifer HigdonLibretto by Jerre Dye A family portrait When Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings. This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending! Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia. Funded in part by The Amphion Foundation, Inc. Performance takes place at The Bitz Opera Factory (Pittsburgh Opera's headquarters), 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh's Strip District. Saturday, April 26, 2025  * 8:00 PM- ~9:15 PM (approx. end time) Ending One. Tuesday, April 29, 2025  * 7:00 PM- ~8:15 PM (approx. end time) Ending Two. Friday, May 2, 2025 * 7:30 PM- ~8:45 PM (approx. end time) Ending Three.

    "title": "La Bohème",
    "date": "Sat, Oct 18 - Sun, Oct 26, 2025",
    "venue": "BENEDUM CENTER",
    "content": "Music by Giacomo Puccini Libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa • OCTOBER 18, 21, 24, 26, 2025 When a candle flickers, love sparks. Set against the backdrop of 1830’s Paris, La Bohème follows four impoverished artists surviving with little more than friendship, passion, and their love for art. When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death. La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs."

    "venue": "BYHAM THEATER",
    "content": "Music by Gregory Spears Libretto by Greg Pierce Based on the novel by Thomas Mallon • NOVEMBER 14, 15, 16, 2025 The Red Scare, tinted lavender. At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic. Antony Walker conducts; Brian Staufenbiel directs."
