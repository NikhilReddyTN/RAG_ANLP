She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life.\nHowever, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.”\nBy Mallery Avidon\nDirected by Anya Hilpert\nPerformances April 23-25\nTickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.\nReserve Tickets\nContent & Sensory Advisories",

    "date": "April 25, 2025",
    "time_location": "4 p.m.\nJohn Wells Video Studio, Purnell Center for the Arts",
    "description": "Grace was supposed to have a certain kind of life. She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life.\nHowever, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.”\nBy Mallery Avidon\nDirected by Anya Hilpert\nPerformances April 23-25\nTickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.\nReserve Tickets\nContent & Sensory Advisories",

    "description": "Settlement, industrialization, urbanization and redevelopment have each left a profound mark on the region’s built environment. The architecture bears testimony to the forces that shaped it, but buildings can only tell part of the stories. The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors. These architectural records document an irretrievable past (for buildings demolished or left unbuilt), facilitate the preservation and reuse of extant buildings, and inform our understanding of our surroundings.\n\nFor the past 40 years, the Architecture Archives collections at Carnegie Mellon University have documented thousands of projects and the work of hundreds of designers. Records have been obtained from architects and their firms, families, property owners, and governments. This wide diversity of materials—preliminary sketches, renderings, specifications, photographs, publications and architectural models—helps piece together the rich history of Pittsburgh and the region.\nVisit the exhibit website to learn more.",

    "description": "Carnegie Mellon University entered the 80s as a well-respected regional university, but President Richard Cyert’s vision at the start of the decade would help turn CMU into an international leader in innovation, technology and the arts.\nBefore long, robotics, computer software and the Internet were integral parts of the campus. In 1984, Terregator—the “world’s first rugged, capable, autonomous outdoor navigation robot”—was completing its field testing at CMU. In 1985, the university began working with Apple founder Steve Jobs to develop part of the Mach operating system that ran on his NeXT computer workstation. In 1986, CMU launched the Andrew system, a joint endeavor between IBM and CMU to create the world’s first university-wide computer network and file system.\nThis growth led the university to develop a comprehensive video marketing plan that attracted the attention of high school guidance counselors, parents, and students from around the country.\nBy the decade’s end, the university experience had transformed in ways few could have imagined.\nLearn more at https://library.cmu.edu/about/exhibits/cmu-1980s",
