The Sculpture Court provides open-air space for encountering large-scale sculptures, new commissions, architecture, and landscape. Read on to learn about the artworks you can encounter in the Sculpture Court, and check out our events calendar to find out about seasonal performances. Art Around You Andrea GeyerManifest How do you see yourself, your body, your views, ideas, and experiences as you move within this museum?I want, I demand, I need, I insist.Andrea Geyer’sManifestactively acknowledges and embraces the idea that a museum is made of many people: from visitors and staff to artists, we make and remake the museum every single day. The eight banners with text facing inside and outside of the museum windows cast our voices beyond constructions of past and present and the impermeability of institutions while calling each of our imaginations into a shared space. For Carnegie Museum of Art, Geyer invites you to contemplate your own needs and desires in relation to the museum today. The artist has created an interactive broadside to create your own list of wants, needs, visions, and demands. Download Broadside ⤓ Read More Read More Manifeststems from Geyer’s research on San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s (SFMOMA) founding director Grace McCann Morley and her belief in museums as integral to civil society and civic life. Morley led this museum from 1935 to 1958, establishing gallery tours, art history courses, a public art library, an art rental gallery, the first film program at an American museum, and the TV show “Art in Your Life.” An advocate for modern art and cultural democracy. Under Morley’s direction, the museum was open until 10 p.m. As a result of these efforts, it garnered a following that was expansive and diverse in age, race, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Morley wrote in 1950, “Art is an inseparable and essential part of human life.” Geyer took Morley’s mission to show the importance of art in every aspect of life and scripted a list of wants, needs, and demands put toward museums as an invitation to reimagine what one expects and hopes for when engaging such institutions today. Additionally, the statements inManifestdraw from writings and lectures by Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin, and Michel Foucault, as well as from those by more recent thinkers such as Wendy Brown, Jack Halberstam, Stefano Harney, and Fred Moten. Geyer also included references in response to the 2016 presidential election (which took place while Geyer was writing the original script) that called for museums to be sites of resistance and sanctuary. Kenneth SnelsonForest Devil This steel sculpture byKenneth Snelsonis one of several works created in 1977 forSculpturescape, located in Mellon Square Park in downtown Pittsburgh, a citywide arts project that paired internationally known artists with local industrial firms to create large-scale public sculpture throughout the city. Comprising polished steel tubes and aircraft cables,Forest Devilis a characteristic example of Snelson’s interest in using simple linear forms to create complex, dynamic structures. Read More Read More The sculpture operates on a basic pull-push principle. The tubes act as rigid components pushing outward, while the cables draw the structure inward. This precise combination of opposing forces establishes an equilibrium that holds the form together, a physical state that Snelson called “tensegrity,” a contraction of the words, “tension” and “integrity.” The overlapping linear forms and polished reflective surfaces create the illusion of a turbulent, moving structure, perhaps suggesting a visual metaphor for the work’s title. Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation donated the aircraft cables, and the sculpture was fabricated locally by Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company and Colonial Machine Company. Snelson was among four artists commissioned forSculpturescape, the others were Clement Meadmore, Jack Youngerman, and John Henry.Sculpturescapewas a project of the Three Rivers Arts Festival, a subsidiary of theWomen’s Committee of Carnegie Museum of Art.    Tavares StrachanThe Encyclopaedia of Invisibility Tavares Strachan, whose practice is located at the intersection of science, art, and the environment, creates ambitious works that investigate the nature of invisibility and the conditions that frame and legitimize certain histories while obscuring and erasing others. Strachan also aims to build and connect communities through his work by making networks of power more visible, prompting viewers to reconsider their social roles at the local and global levels.The Encyclopaedia of Invisibilitywas commissioned for theCarnegie International, 57th Edition, 2018, and originally included 54 neon signs. Read More Read More The names on the neon signs were selected from the entries in a 2,400-page book, also titledThe Encyclopaedia of Invisibility(2018). The eleven remaining names on the building’s façade include: Wilson, Klint, Selassie, Nancy, Moondog, Malcolm, Smalls, Rosalind, Wallace, Fernald, and Lepaute. This installation is a major achievement for the artist and was a highlight of the International. It would be the first work by Strachan to enter the collection. “I intend to use these neon names to light up the Pittsburgh sky, crossing barriers such as time, space, race, and gender.” After his first site visit, Tavares Strachan said that what impressed him most about the museum was the ribbon of names of great men etched into the stone of the old building. He proposed illuminating these worthies with another list. Written in script, buzzing in neon, are the surnames of people whose historical invisibility is now brought to light. Placed between existing names, the neon scripts are here not to erase but to electrify your relationship to the museum.

Our Museum Based Learning program for graduate and post-graduate students and professionals  provides curricula and workshops to deepen and expand learning environments and resources.. This facilitated museum experience creates a structure to unplug and slow down, opening up space for social, emotional, and art-centered dialogue Our inquiry-based methodology encourages students to learn more about themselves, their peers, and the world around them by examining shared humanity through inquiry-based art analysis while connecting content to specific fields of study. Through structured conversations rooted in artworks, participants will strengthen their skills of empathy, critical thinking, and self-awareness. Example Structure of Workshops 90-minute sessions in the galleries, with extended conversations near a limited number of artworks. Each conversation is timed at 20 or 30 minutes to encourage close looking, critical thinking, reflection, and sharing by all participants, as well as removing a sense of urgency that so often creeps into our work. The sessions may also include writing prompts, self-exploration in the galleries around a topic or guiding question, as well as group reflection on the experience. Want to Get Started?

How might the design of a living room or a kitchen relate to—and empower—a broader sense of community? For Tatiana Bilbao (born 1972) and her Mexico City practiceTatiana Bilbao Estudio, architecture results from research that includes exploratory exhibitions. In this exhibition, five of the galleries are assigned an individual room typology—kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and garden. The architects associate each room type with current projects, revealing, for instance, the role of communal kitchens in a residential building in Mexico City or the way small gardens coexist with houses in St. Louis, MO. These relationships offer new possibilities for privacy and publicness. City of Roomscommunicates an approach to architecture filled with incident and capable of change across time. Tatiana Bilbao Estudio’s vision, research, and experimental practice welcome us into an interdependent, vital, and mutually supportive urban fabric, a proverbial city of rooms.

Text by Katie Anania, Donna Cassidy, John Corbett. Chronology by Cynthia Stucki. Published by Carnegie Museum of Art and Colby College Museum of Art ISBN 9781636811550 This book is the definitive scholarly volume on Chicago artist Gertrude Abercrombie, who was a critical figure in themid-20th-centuryChicago art and jazz scenes. Abercrombie was a creative force of singular vision who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings full of personal significance. With a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary and a restrained palette, she produced potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. Cats, owls, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells and searching female figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of purposeful introspection and emotional struggle. Drawing consistently on her dreams as source material, Abercrombie said, “The whole world is a mystery.” Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mysteryaccompanies the artist’s first retrospective since 1991: an eponymous exhibition which begins at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh before traveling to the Colby College Museum of Art in Maine and the Milwaukee Art Museum.

This playlist combines the jazz she loved and songs with themes that are found in her work and life. Some tracks feature Abercrombie’s jazz friends, legendary figures like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Marian McPartland, and Sonny Rollins (the latter of whom was an especially close pal); other jazz selections, including ones by Baby Face Willette, Gene Ammons, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago, draw from the teeming local scene during the prime time of Abercrombie’s work, from the 1950s-70s. Dinah Washington is included in recognition Abercrombie’s daughter Dinah, who she named after the star singer; the piece “Gertrude’s Bounce” was written by pianist Richie Powell for Max Roach and Clifford Brown as a description of Abercrombie’s peculiar way of walking. Some of the painter’s main themes to which songs here allude include: black cats, owls, leafless trees, and dreams, while other selections celebrate themes of alterity and strangeness, in recognition of the uncanny quality of Abercrombie’s eccentric and wondrous little paintings.

        "content": "Conservation Conservation is a set of activities that aims to ensure that visitors today and tomorrow have equitable access to the enjoyment and study of our collections. Carnegie Museum of Art employs a dedicated team of experts who are responsible for the study, treatment, and care of all works of art and design in our collection. Read on to learn more about what they do! History The museum’s history of collections care dates to the earliest days of the Carnegie Institute. In preparation for the 1907 opening of the expanded museum campus in 1907, more than 200 plaster casts of classical architecture and sculpture made in Italy traveled to Pittsburgh by ship to form the museum’s now famed Hall of Architecture. While most of the Italian sculptors hired to transport and install the casts returned to Italy, Rosario (Ross) Polis remained in Pittsburgh and served until the end of his life as the caretaker of the museum’s cast and sculpture collection (nearly 50 years). The museum’s conservation department was officially founded in 1981 with the creation of a dedicated laboratory space and hiring of its first full-time paintings conservator, Karen Crenshaw. The lab expanded in 1990 with the addition of a dedicated objects conservation laboratory and sculpture conservator. Housed in a 2,000 square foot laboratory, today, the museum’s conservation team possesses specialized training in caring for the diversity of artworks that comprise our collection, including but not limited to sculptures, design objects, paintings, furniture, time-based media, works on paper, and photography. Preservation Preservation includes all actions taken to slow or limit the aging or rapid change of artworks and comprises a large portion of our team’s day-to-day activities. These activities include monitoring light levels and pollutants, engaging in integrated pest management, and developing standards for case design and construction materials used on or near works of art. Treatment Treatment processes can include cleaning, consolidation, reinforcement, stabilization, and protection. Treatment projects of individual artworks are developed on a case-by-case basis and closely with our curatorial team, artists, and other stakeholders to ensure all actions taken support the integrity of the artwork. Research Working closely with curators, scholars, and, frequently, living artists themselves, our conservators engage in research activities to deepen their understanding of modern and contemporary artistic practices. Our laboratories are equipped with scientific tools like optical microscopes, polarized light microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and multispectral imaging. Restoration ProjectsAmong the department’s major accomplishments are: the cleaning and restoration by a team of 11 of John White Alexander’s 3,500 square footCrowning of Labormurals in the museum’sGrand Staircase(1995) led by paintings conservator Ellen Baxter (who worked from 1990 until she retired in 2022); the conservation of the 18 x 24 foot gilded urushi lacqueredChariot of Aurorapanels from the French ocean linerNormandie(1997–1998); and the Mellon-funded Time-Based Media Project (2013–2015). Outreach We believe in the power of art and science to inspire curiosity, discovery, and joy. Our conservation team serves as a resource to the Pittsburgh community and cultural heritage field at large and contributes to the advancement of modern and contemporary art conservation through lectures, tours, workshops, and publications. We endeavor to share our work with the public to make conservation accessible to all. Training and Mentorship Our team is dedicated to fostering the cultural heritage professionals of tomorrow. Mentorship is an important activity of conservation labs, as supervised experience with professionals is a necessary component of conservation higher education. Carnegie Museum of Art is proud of our former interns and volunteers who have gone on to pursue graduate school studies and careers as art conservators in the Pittsburgh region and throughout the world!

Each year, Carnegie Museum of Art invites a filmmaker or artist to curate the Film Series, offering visitors the chance to enjoy film and time-based media, a medium that Carnegie Museum of Art has showcased and collected for decades. Past Series  2024: Programmed by Astria Suparak “Alternate realities, reincarnation, and remembrance; complex family relationships and inherited trauma; the wreckage of capitalism and carceral culture; and formal experimentation are ideas that have much resonance to me and unfold in various forms throughout the series.” —Astria Suparak The 2024 Carnegie Museum of Art Film Series programmed by artist and curator Astria Suparak features a special program each month that expands out of a singular idea, topic, or question that is catalyzed by artworks in the museum’s collection. For each program, Suparak has curated a combination of forms, ranging from feature-length narratives and documentaries to music videos, formalist experiments, animation, and internet memes. The selections date from 1920s avant-garde cinema to a new collage video created for the series. Astria Suparak is based in Oakland, California. Her cross-disciplinary projects address complex and urgent issues (like institutionalized racism, feminisms, and colonialism) made accessible through a popular culture lens, such as science fiction movies, rock music, and sports. Straddling creative and scholarly work, the projects often take the form of publicly available tools and databases, chronicling subcultures and omitted perspectives. Artists and filmmakers include: 2023: Programmed by Tony Buba Tony Buba, an internationally acclaimed filmmaker from Braddock, Pennsylvania, inaugurates the 2023 Film Series, running May through December 2023. This year’s selection will introduce 17 films and 24 directors to a new generation of filmgoers in the Carnegie Museum of Art Theater, with special screenings in the museum’s outdoor Sculpture Court. Buba, best known for documentaries about Pennsylvania, curated the inaugural Film Series lineup, which explores topics relevant to the region, such as labor, inequity, and identity. The expansive roster of films includes rarely seen and critically acclaimed documentaries and feature films, including work made by Buba and other filmmakers and directors, such as Peggy Ahwesh and Manny Kirchheimer. 4400 Forbes AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15213+1 412.622.3131 Terms of Use,Privacy Policy,Non-Discrimination Policy©Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute.

        "content": "Gertrude Abercrombie:The Whole World Is a Mystery Gertrude Abercrombie (American, 1909–1977) was a critical figure in themid-20th-centuryChicago art scene and a creative force who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings populated with objects and figures of personal significance. With a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary, and a restrained palette, she created potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. Cats, owls, snails, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells, forking paths, and masked figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of wistful introspection and emotional struggle. Drawing consistently on her own dreams as source material, Abercrombie said, “The whole world is a mystery.” This exhibition presents a rare opportunity for museum visitors to appreciate—in significant depth—Abercrombie’s highly personal language that draws on surrealist and magic realism approaches to probe deeply into the nature of things. Featuring loans from important institutional and private collections,Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mysteryis the most comprehensive museum presentation of the artist’s work to date. Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mysteryis co-organized byCarnegieMuseum of Art and Colby College Museum of Art, and is curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and Sarah Humphreville, Lunder Curator of American Art, Colby College Museum of Art, with Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant, Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibition will be on view at Colby College Museum of Art from July 12, 2025 through Jan. 11, 2026. Upcoming Events About the Artist Gertrude Abercrombie was born in 1909 in Austin, Texas. She grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago but also spent significant time in her father’s hometown of Aledo, Illinois, which would later become a source of inspiration for her paintings. She earned a degree in Romance languages at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1929, after which she pursued a year-long course in commercial art at the American Academy of Art and may also have briefly attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1932, Abercrombie began her career as a professional artist, an ambition that was forwarded when she gained employment on the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA/FAP) from 1935–1940. She showed her work widely, including in the Art Institute of Chicago’s annual exhibitions and at avant-garde venues like the Katharine Kuh Gallery. By the late 1930s, Abercrombie had developed her mature style, creating tightly executed paintings populated by personal symbols that pulse with mystery and which have been identified with surrealism, magic realism, and the fantastic. She worked in this vein for the remainder of her career, but her output gradually decreased toward the end of her life due to ongoing health struggles. Abercrombie was also well known as the host of parties and jam sessions, which were attended by her artist, writer, and jazz musician friends. Selected Works Every reasonable effort has been made to identify, contact, and acknowledge rights holders. To correct an error or omission, please reach out to ourRights and Reproductionsteam.

        "content": "Hall of Architecture Welcome to the Hall of Architecture, where history comes to life. Since 1907, our collection of over 140 plaster casts of architectural masterpieces from the past has been a treasure of Pittsburgh. Our Hall of Architecture was inspired by one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and it has remained intact through decades of public exhibition. Visiting the Hall of Architecture offers the rare opportunity to appreciate a cultural phenomenon of international scope. Why Plaster Casts?In the past, collectors believed that a replica of a masterpiece was superior to a mediocre original. This fascination with plaster casts dates back to ancient Greece and Rome and continued through the Renaissance into the 19th century. Plaster casts were particularly popular during this time as they were featured in international fairs and served as educational tools for both amateurs and art students. Our collection was made possible by the vision of Andrew Carnegie, who by 1907 had amassed a collection of 144 architectural casts, 69 plaster reproductions of sculpture, and 360 replicas in bronze, including beloved favorites from classical antiquity, such as the Apollo Belvedere and the Venus de Milo, as well as Gothic masterpieces like the Florence Baptistry doors, and even a full reproduction of the facade of St.-Gilles-du-Gard. Nowadays, plaster casts are not as popular as they once were, and most collections have been dispersed or destroyed. We invite you to come experience this distinguished part of our collection for yourself, and step back in time to encounter the beauty of these architectural masterpieces!

        "content": "Hall of Sculpture Come visit our collection of reproduction Egyptian, Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman sculptures in a magnificent and tranquil space. Our Hall of Sculpture was inspired by the iconic Parthenon temple in Athens, Greece. Dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon was known for its imperial scale, stunning decorative sculptures, and harmonious architectural elements. The Hall of Sculpture is modeled after the Parthenon’s inner sanctuary, orcella, which featured a double tier of columns. The hall was constructed using brilliant white marble from the same quarries in Greece that provided the stone for the Parthenon. A balcony with a decorative iron railing offers  visitors on the museum’s second floor a chance to  also enjoy the view. Today, the balcony is reserved for decorative arts objects, like glass, ceramics, and metalwork that date from the 18th to the 20th century. Read More Read More Some of Andrew Carnegie’s cast collection, including several pieces from the Parthenon itself, are currently on display in the Hall of Architecture, and, you’ll also  find several works on pedestals around the Hall of Sculpture balcony as a reminder of the room’s original purpose. If you look up in the Hall of Sculpture, you’ll see a plaster reproduction of the carved frieze that was originally on the exterior of the Parthenon’scella. This frieze depicts the procession that inaugurated the annual festival of Athena in ancient Athens. Today, the Hall of Sculpture displays works from our permanent collection and frequently hosts site-specific installations and performances, providing  a unique and worthwhile experience every time you encounter this awe-inspiring space! Art Around You Lothar BaumgartenTongue of the Cherokee TheTongue of the Cherokeeis a site-specific work presented as part of the1988 Carnegie Internationalby German artist Lothar Baumgarten. The artist drew inspiration from the Cherokee syllabary—symbols that represent syllables—invented by Sequoyah (ca. 1770–1843). A polymath and self-taught linguist, Sequoyah devised the syllabary in 1821. By 1825, the Cherokee Nation, which had primarily used an oral language, adopted it as its official written language. The increase in the nation’s literacy to almost 100% by the 1850s—especially against the historical backdrop of the forced removal of Cherokee people as part of the Trail of Tears (1830–1850)—speaks to the immense significance of the syllabary. Inspired by Sequoyah’s ingenuity and purpose, Baumgarten inscribed the 85 characters of the Cherokee syllabary upon the glass panels of the skylight in Carnegie Museum of Art’s Hall of Sculpture. The installation is positioned in a space modeled on the Parthenon, the temple of Athena in Greece. By presenting the syllabary in this site that monumentalizes Western culture, the artist intended to challenge claims of Western cultural superiority. Nicole EisenmanPrince of Swords The work of Nicole Eisenman spans the absurd and abject to the introspective and irreverent, drawing on sources as varied as the iconography of classical myths and contemporary popular culture. Her paintings and sculptures vacillate between the depiction of a world rooted in the visual language of art history and a forthright, comedic, and critical meditation on everyday life. Prince of Swordsis one of five figurative sculptures the artist created for the museum’s Hall of Sculpturefor the2013 Carnegie International. The title refers to the prince (analogous to the “jack”) of the suit of swords in the tarot, a deck of occult playing cards used in fortune-telling. The prince of swords is an ambiguous symbol, referring to a private and deceptive but also highly intelligent and well-educated person with a sharp mind and great capacity for abstract thinking. Eisenman’s interpretation blends in eastern mysticism as well: the quartz crystal lodged in the neck refers to the throat chakra, the seat of communication and self-expression in tantric belief systems. These arcane allusions meet contemporary life in the prince’s antisocial posture,hunched over a smart phone, suggesting an archetypal character adapted to modern ways of being. Thu Van TranColors of Grey On view through February 2026 Colors of Greyis part of Thu Van Tran’s ongoing exploration of remembrance and systems of erasure in the context of Vietnam’s geo-historical relations with France and the United States. For this work, the artist takes as point of departure the “Rainbow Herbicides” used by the US military during the Vietnam War. These chemicals were sprayed over 4.5 million acres of forests, rivers, and farmland—devastating plant, animal, and human life. Although Agent Orange is the best known of these herbicides, it was combined with Agents White, Pink, Green, Blue, and Purple to form a lethal weapon with devastating impact on the people of Vietnam and their land for generations. In the Hall of Sculpture, Tran worked with pigments that match the color of these herbicides, layering them to create ten frescos that not only recall the violence of war but also depictions of the sublime in Western painting. Further, Tran draws attention to the word “rainbow,” which in this context of human-made horror, has turned this natural wonder grey. Colors of Greywas commissioned by Carnegie Museum of Art for the58th Carnegie International. This artwork is on loan to the museum, courtesy of the artist.

Take a minute to browse our museum lobbies, featuring large-scale works by El Anatsui, Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, and Christopher Wool. Art Around You El AnatsuiPalettes of Ambition As part of the57th Carnegie International, Ghanaian artist El Anatsui createdThree Angles, a monumental sculpture that clad the façade of Carnegie Museum of Art’s Edward Larrabee Barnes building. A master sculptor known for his innovative use of post-consumer materials, Anatsui created a site-specific work that responded to Pittsburgh’s distinct geography and Richard Serra’s sculpture,Carnegie, by using reflective materials, used printing plates from a local printer, and his signature metal weave of aluminum bottle caps. While the locally sourced components of the work were recycled or discarded after the closing of the International, the aluminum bottle caps that anchored his composition were sent back to his studio in Nsukka, Nigeria. Over the past three years, Anatsui reincorporated the materials into a new work of a grand scale that features the myriad ways in which the aluminum caps can transform into patterns and shapes while creating a sense of volume from an otherwise flat material. Read More Read More Anatsui is known for his exceptional openness to variations in the installation of his work; he embraces and emphasizes the flexibility of his metal sculpture by encouraging drapery-like folds in the installation process, which makes the work adaptable to the surface on which it will be mounted. Most significantly, this work is made with the museum in mind, by an artist with a keen understanding of the building, its materiality, and its artworks, such as Serra’sCarnegieand Henry Moore’sReclining Figure. An artist of distinguished honors and awards, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement from the 2015 Venice Biennale, Anatsui has used his work as a platform to reorient the discourse on contemporary African art by using materials that speak to Nigeria’s liquor industry, global consumerism, and waste, and the place of African nations in the larger circulation of commodities. With conceptual and aesthetic rigor, he has pushed the discipline of sculpture to lead conversations about material histories, gravity, and plasticity. This major acquisition by the museum positions Anatsui’s work among those by celebrated sculptors of historic importance and marks a significant contribution to our collection, which can proudly be described as a living archive of past Carnegie Internationals. Andrea GeyerManifest How do you see yourself, your body, your views, ideas, and experiences as you move within this museum?I want, I demand, I need, I insist.Andrea Geyer’sManifestactively acknowledges and embraces the idea that a museum is made of many people: from visitors and staff to artists, we make and remake the museum every single day. The eight banners with text facing inside and outside of the museum windows cast our voices beyond constructions of past and present and the impermeability of institutions while calling each of our imaginations into a shared space. For Carnegie Museum of Art, Geyer invites you to contemplate your own needs and desires in relation to the museum today. The artist has created an interactive broadside to create your own list of wants, needs, visions, and demands. Download Broadside ⤓ Read More Read More Manifeststems from Geyer’s research on the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s (SFMOMA) founding director Grace McCann Morley and her belief in museums as integral to civil society and civic life. Morley led this museum from 1935 to 1958, establishing gallery tours, art history courses, a public art library, an art rental gallery, the first film program at an American museum, and the TV show “Art in Your Life.” An advocate for modern art and cultural democracy. Under Morley’s direction, the museum was open until 10 p.m. As a result of these efforts, it garnered a following that was expansive and diverse in age, race, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Morley wrote in 1950, “Art is an inseparable and essential part of human life.” Geyer took Morley’s mission to show the importance of art in every aspect of life and scripted a list of wants, needs, and demands put toward museums as an invitation to reimagine what one expects and hopes for when engaging such institutions today. Additionally, the statements inManifestdraw from writings and lectures by Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin, and Michel Foucault, as well as from those by more recent thinkers such as Wendy Brown, Jack Halberstam, Stefano Harney, and Fred Moten. Geyer also included references in response to the 2016 presidential election (which took place while Geyer was writing the original script) that called for museums to be sites of resistance and sanctuary. Sol LeWittWall Drawing #450andWall Drawing #493 Two distinct but related wall drawings by Sol LeWitt span this wall on the stairs leading to Scaife Gallery. Seen on the left,Wall Drawing #450was commissioned for the 1985 Carnegie International. In 1986, LeWitt saw the completed work and decided to extend it with the complementaryWall Drawing #493. Working under instructions provided by the artist, several individuals created these drawings by applying washes of India ink to a primed wall surface. Over time, the ink faded from exposure to sunlight; but in 2007, the drawings were restored to their original color and luminosity using more stable acrylic paints. Read More Read More Asserting that the “idea becomes the machine that makes the art,” LeWitt was a critical figure in the shift to Conceptual art in the late 1960s. This notion, which refutes the traditional conception of the artist as exclusive author or creative genius, is underscored in LeWitt’s drawings conceived after 1970. These exist initially only as a certified set of written instructions, which are adapted to a given space by the individuals who carry out the directions (in the case of these drawings, dividing the wall “vertically into four equal parts,” and so on.) Because they conform to their particular surroundings and reflect the decisions and handiwork of the people who execute them, the works of art are different each time they are installed. Initially, LeWitt participated in the execution of his drawings, but later works have all been carried out by others who meticulously follow his directives. The 2007 restoration was completed by: Sarah Heinemann with Chantal Bernicky, Matthew Cummings, Cara Erskine, Robin Hewlett, Lilith Bailey Kroll, Dale Luce, Julia McAfee, Sandra Streiff, and Stephen Stribling. Lawrence WeinerEver Widening Circles of Shattered Glass “Walls were built for things to be put on them.”—Lawrence Weiner ArtistLawrence Weinerworked with language as both material and form. He believed “walls were built for things to be put on them.” For Weiner, text when installed on a wall can become a sculpture, or the description of making artwork can become the artwork itself. Acquired by the museum in 1986,Ever Widening Circles of Shattered Glassis one example of his language-based wall sculptures and does not have a prescribed location and can even be installed in more than one place at one time. Read More Read More The work’s size, color, and format change based on where it is displayed. For this installation, completed months before he passed away, Weiner rendered the artwork—its scale, colors, and materials—to respond to the architecture of this space: the slope and width of the ramp, the height of the walls, and the path of museum visitors. Christopher WoolUntitled Christopher Woolmade this oversize painting for the 1991 Carnegie International, where it was exhibited on an outdoor wall. Comprising an excerpt fromThe Revolution of Everyday Life, a 1967 book by the Situationist writer Raoul Vaneigem, it is an especially bleak assessment of contemporary rootlessness and alienation. The emphatic, geometrically spaced lettering, and the arbitrary arrangement of words recontextualize Vaneigem’s statement in an ambiguous way, imparting a sense of intrigue and foreboding to viewers entering the museum from the parking lot. In its scale and use of text, the painting mimics the format of a billboard while calling into question the very culture of advertising. Wool developed his approach in the wake of 1970s Conceptual art strategies that questioned the conventions of painting. He often works on metal and frequently, as seen here, applies paint through non-gestural commercial processes, such as stenciling, rolling, stamping, and dripping, thus undermining the preciousness associated with marks left by a brush in the artist’s hand. Wool links his repetitive use of language to his repetitive patterns, explored through form, line, color, composition, and a particular emphasis on surface.

        "content": "Gala Porras-Kim: The reflection at the threshold of a categorical division Forum 90 Systems of categorization and inevitable mislabeling, material preservation and eventual degradation, and an impulse to record in the face of inherent forgetfulness—these contradictions inform Gala Porras-Kim’s (b. 1984, Bogotá, Colombia) interest in museums and their practices. In dialogue with curators at Carnegie Museum of Art over the past two years, Porras-Kim has been trawling the museum’s database to better understand its holdings and the Carnegie Institute’s evolving cataloguing systems and acquisition history. Her findings reveal overlapping areas in the collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Carnegie Public Library, where each institution stewards their objects differently—as art, science, and information respectively. Porras-Kim proposes that art is not a fixed category, and questions the conceptual frameworks and individual subjectivities that go into presenting and understanding an object as a work of art. Gala Porras-Kimis organized by Liz Park, Richard Armstrong Curator of Contemporary Art, and Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant.

        "url": "https://carnegieart.org/art/collections/provenance/",
        "content": "Provenance Provenance—from the Frenchprovenir(to come from)—is a chronological record of ownership, custody, and location of an object, ideally from its creation to the present. Art historians have long studied provenance to enhance scholarly understanding. Uncovering the journey of an object—from who owned it and where it has been—can shed light on its purpose, state, and significance in the world of collecting. A thorough provenance not only offers a glimpse into an object’s past, but also serves as a crucial tool for verifying its authenticity and assessing issues of ethical and legal transfer. Why is Provenance Important? It’s not uncommon for an object, especially one that is centuries old, to have an incomplete provenance. Information about the transfer of an artwork may have been lost, destroyed, not yet uncovered, or simply never recorded in the first place. But it’s important to study provenance to rule out unethical or illicit activity. Modern provenance research is as complex and time-consuming as it is important; it is a dynamic process, akin to detective work. As new sources and information become available, object records are updated. The Museum as a Provenance LeaderThe museum serves as a leader in digital provenance, and you can learn more about the museum’s provenance research via itsArt Tracks Digital Provenance Project, an initiative that aims to turn provenance into structured data. Most recently, from 2015–2017, our team undertook the Northbrook Provenance Project, an attempt to reconstruct the history of ownership of all the paintings that were once the property of the Earls of Northbrook and their predecessors. Seven of these paintings are in our collection, and hundreds more reside in public and private collections worldwide. About the Northbrook Project → If you’re interested in learning more about provenance field wide standards and guidelines for museums, please visit theAssociation of Art Museum Directors(AAMD) and theAmerican Alliance of Museums(AAM).

        "content": "Curatorial Practice Did you ever wonder what a curator at an art museum does? Carnegie Museum of Art relies on a dedicated team of curators who are responsible for the study, development, and stewardship of the collection as well as the creation of exhibitions and installations. Our curators engage with artists, scholars, community members, donors, and other cultural stakeholders, and they work collaboratively with all teams at our museum to create compelling experiences that connect people to art, ideas, and one another. Our museum champions a thoughtful and interdisciplinary curatorial practice that ensures that our museum and collection remain a resource to the people of Pittsburgh and beyond, today, and tomorrow. Scholarship Through research and interpretation, our curators produce and facilitate scholarship on artists and their practice, as well as movements, style, and art histories. They are constantly learning from peers at other institutions, as well as scholars, artists, and other practitioners to reflect on current knowledge and ask questions that invite multiple perspectives and broaden our understanding of art. This scholarship impacts the ongoing development and stewardship of the collection as well as the presentation of artworks in exhibitions and other installations. Collection Development One of the principal responsibilities of the museum is the care and acquisition of works of art. To that end, our curators conduct research to explore objects’ history andprovenance. They also examine inherited narratives and identify new acquisitions to add to our collection. While the collection anchors our history, every acquisition also holds transformative potential for the emergence of multifaceted narratives about art. From time to time, artworks are deaccessioned and permanently removed from the collection to refine and improve its quality and to better serve the museum’s mission. In accordance with the Association of Art Museum Directors and the American Alliance of Museums, Carnegie Museum of Art defines direct care as direct costs associated with the storage and preservation of the works of art it holds in public trust. Exhibitions and Installations Our curators collaborate with artists, community partners, scholars, and colleagues within and outside the museum to present artworks. They envision the galleries as spaces for contemporary conversations about art, society, and culture. Exhibitions and collection presentations provide an opportunity to share with our audiences our ever-developing thoughts and perspectives on plural art histories as well as distinct institutional and regional histories.

        "content": "Hillman Photography Initiative What does the future of photography look like? Since its start in 2013, the Hillman Photography Initiative has showcased dynamic new artworks, exhibitions, publications, online experiences, and conversations transforming our relationship to the photographic medium. The Hillman Photography Initiative connects Carnegie Museum of Art with diverse audiences to exchange new ideas about photography. The Initiative presents a series of programs over two-year cycles centered around a concept or theme in which photography impacts our contemporary world. For each cycle, we collaborate with artists and creative thinkers to create innovative and insightful projects. Cycle 4: Widening the Lens2024–2025 Photography has dramatically altered our access to, understanding of, and impact on the natural world. Through programming that includes the exhibitionWidening the Lens: Photography, Ecology, and the Contemporary Landscape,a podcast series, and publication,Widening the Lensexamines environmental history and degradation, particularly in the American landscape, as well as urgent concerns surrounding climate change, through the camera lens. Learn More → Cycle 3: Mirror with a Memory2020–2021 How are images being utilized to gather data on our daily activities? With the development and advancement of artificial intelligence, there has been a radical change in the way surveillance systems capture, categorize, and synthesize photographs. Mirror with a Memory explores the worlds of AI, photography, and surveillance—their past, present, and future—to underscore concerns about implicit bias, right to privacy, and police monitoring embedded in corporate, military, and law enforcement applications. Learn More → Cycle 2: Lightime2016–2017 How can we employ the essential elements of photography to create a new definition of the medium? At its most basic, photography records light over time to create an image. But what if we use it to record light over time to create something different? These four artist projects, as well as the Light Clock on the museum’s front plaza, push the envelope on what is photographic. With this new definition, photography becomes a springboard to investigate and participate in contemporary social issues. Learn More → Cycle 1: Life Cycles of Images2014–2015 What is the lifecycle of an image—from creation and transmission to consumption, storage, potential loss, and reemergence? We live in a world of image sharing, and these four projects investigate the boundaries and possibilities of photography through the ways it is circulated. Technology accelerates this circulation, and often alters or redirects the trajectory of an image in unexpected, powerful ways.

This automatically collected data generally does not identify any specific individual, but to the extent such data is reasonably capable of identifying you or another person, we will treat such data as Personal Information. This automatically collected information may include data on how you use our Sites, what pages you have visited, or any errors that occurred while you were visiting our Sites.

We may also use third-party analytics providers which could automatically collect certain Personal Information and other data about you through the Sites including, but not limited to, your IP address and/or other online identifiers. Third-party cookies or other tracking technology may be used through this process to track data such as the times you most frequently use the Sites, what devices you use to access the Services, what parts of the Services you visit and the links you use to get there. These data and analytics service providers may use such information to track how you use the Services, measure the performance of the Services, improve features on the Services, and provide Carnegie Museums with tools that satisfy overall operating needs for the Services.

You also can review the “Your Choices” section, below, for other details on how you may be able to request changes regarding Carnegie Museums’ handling of Personal Information it maintains about you.

When registering for such online Services, please review any information made available about the video conference service provider for the applicable program or event, including that provider’s privacy policy, for more details about how that provider may handle the Personal Information or other data it collects from you. Other third parties, such as social media platforms and other providers of services that rely on user generated content may be able to collect certain data that could include your Personal Information over time and across different online services when you interact with the Sites and other online Services. If at any time it becomes reasonably necessary, we will release the Personal Information and other data Carnegie Museums maintains about you if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or in cooperation with a government or law enforcement investigation, to comply with a court order, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Carnegie Museums, its personnel, the users of its Services, or others. Personal Information received or held by Carnegie Museums may be transferred if our ownership status changes. Under such circumstances, Carnegie Museums will make reasonable efforts to cause any successor to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. We also may disclose your Personal Information to other service providers to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts related to your use of the Services, or as otherwise described to you at or before the point when we collect your Personal Information. As a donor, member, and visitor of the Carnegie Museums, as a user of the Sites or our other Services, and by providing to or otherwise allowing Carnegie Museums to collect the Personal Information and other data referenced above, you agree, without limitation or qualification, that Carnegie Museums may process such Personal Information and other data in accordance with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.

Your Choices Depending on where you are and how you use our Services such as, for example, if you participate in our membership program, you may be able to ask questions or make certain choices with respect to Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you. For example, in some situations you may be able to request (subject to applicable legal exceptions): In addition, depending on where you are when you use our Services, you may submit requests regarding Personal Information you provided to Carnegie Museums, or that Carnegie Museums may have collected about you, such as requests to: If at any time you would like to request the ability to edit or delete any Personal Information Carnegie Museums may have about you, opt-out of receiving further information from Carnegie Museums, limit what we share, or if you otherwise wish to ask Carnegie Museums to cease using your Personal Information in the manners specified in this Policy (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), please call the Membership Office at 412.622.3314 or send us an email using the addressmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Carnegie Museums is required to try to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information. If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, Carnegie Museums will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Information we store about you before responding to your request. If more information is needed to verify your identity in certain situations, Carnegie Museums may deny your request or ask for more details as necessary to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure and deletion. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, nor does it guarantee that we will be able to process your request. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. The Carnegie Museums reserve the right to refuse any request made regarding your Personal Information if we are unable to process the request for any reason, such as if we are unable to verify the identity of the person making the request or if we cannot authenticate the legitimacy of the request using reasonable efforts. Carnegie Museums is under no obligation or duty to verify the legitimacy of any request regarding Personal Information. Any removal of content by Carnegie Museums does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. Carnegie Museums will do our best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Information from the specified uses. Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request. If the request relates to information Carnegie Museums needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward. Carnegie Museums reserve the right to maintain proper records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from the Carnegie Museums, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send us a detailed email atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org. Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell web sites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. The Sites are not currently configured to respond to “do not track” or similar automated privacy controls. To learn more about ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that occur when you browse the Internet generally and may lead to targeted advertising, visit theNetwork Advertising Initiative web siteand theDigital Advertising Alliance web site. Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that certain third parties may receive information through the Services. Since some of these third parties may respond differently than Carnegie Museums to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information.

Personal Information provided to or collected by Carnegie Museums is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information and other data that could include your Personal Information by placing it on a secure portion of our Sites that are only accessible by certain qualified employees of Carnegie Museums. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information as much as possible, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information. The transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Carnegie Museums, for example. Therefore, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Sites. If you are concerned about sending information to Carnegie Museums online, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. Carnegie Museums is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online. Carnegie Museums retains collected information for as long as needed to fulfill the stated purpose for which the Personal Information was collected or otherwise processed, and thereafter for a variety of legitimate purposes in support of Carnegie Museums and our Services. Carnegie Museums also will retain collected information connected to organizational records for periods of time required or permitted by law. These may include retention periods that are: (1) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations that apply to Carnegie Museums’ operations; (2) for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or (3) needed to maintain adequate and accurate organizational records.  If Carnegie Museums determines that information is no longer needed and no legal obligation to retain such data exists, it will delete such information. Our record-keeping times will be consistent with applicable law. If you have any questions about the security or retention of your Personal Information, please contact us.

If Carnegie Museums learns that we have received Personal Information from any person under 18 years of age without the appropriate consent of the minor’s parent(s) or guardian(s), Carnegie Museums will delete that information. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18, and would like to enroll your child in Carnegie Museums’ virtual learning programs or other online Services, believe your child may have used or uploaded or posted information through the Sites inadvertently or without authorization, and such information is publicly available, or if you believe Carnegie Museums might otherwise have information from or about any person under 13 years of age, please contact us immediately atmembership@carnegiemuseums.org.

        "content": "Grand Staircase Did you know there is a soaring three-story Grand Staircase connecting Carnegie Museum of Art to the Museum of Natural History? Surrounding the Grand Staircase inside the museum  is a sweeping mural that was commissioned for the 1907 expansion of the Carnegie Institute building. Covering almost 4,000 square feet of wall space the muralThe Crowning of Labor(1905–1908), by John White Alexander, reflects turn of the century Western ideals of progress across three floors of the Grand Staircase. Alexander, born in Allegheny City (now Pittsburgh’s North Side), was given creative freedom for the project, and the resulting murals tell a story of Pittsburgh through the lens of Andrew Carnegie’s vision of the steel industry and the wealth gained through Industrial Capitalism that fueled his philanthropy. He completed the first elements of the mural in 1907 and the remainder in 1908. He died before finishing the panels for the third floor. While the depiction of working-class people was novel for murals at the time, in today’s context, they only tell a small part of Pittsburgh’s history. This vision does not reflect the socioeconomic and racial realities of the city, and this imagined apotheosis was not accessible to everyone, no matter how hard one worked. The first floor depicts laborers amidst dark smoke, romanticizing the toil that laid the foundation of Pittsburgh’s wealth and the rise of the city through the steel industry. The second-floor panels capture the hopeful notion that hard work will elevate mankind: the knight (who some say resembles Andrew Carnegie) being crowned embodies the ascendance of Pittsburgh, and the allegorical female figures symbolize knowledge and culture. The paintings on the third floor are meant to represent some of Pittsburgh’s residents, with men, women, and children marching towards an enlightened future gained through education. Alexander died before completing the final panels that would have portrayed Carnegie’s cultural pillars of art, science, music, and literature, and they have since remained unfinished.

Prohibited conduct includes all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, violence, assault, dating violence, domestic violence, interpersonal violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation. This policy prohibits sex discrimination or harassment against all CMP employees and all students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, including: employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals. Title VI, Section 504, and Age Discrimination Act Compliance CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs by any persons involved in CMP’s operations and educational activities, regardless of their position, on the basis of age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law. CMP also prohibits retaliation against someone for reporting prohibited conduct. This policy requires CMP to: 1) investigate reports of prohibited conduct under this policy, 2) establish formal and informal grievance procedures to ensure a fair process, and 3) appoint Coordinators. Inquiries or complaints related to this policy should be directed to CMP’s Department of Human Resources at HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org or 412-622-3311. Anyone who violates this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Role and Responsibilities of the CMP Coordinators CMP has designated a Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, and ADA Coordinator (“Coordinator”). Additionally, CMP has designated a Deputy Coordinator for each museum component and central services department and for its students. The Coordinator is responsible for: 1) ensuring CMP complies with and carries out its responsibilities under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act, and its implementing regulations; 2) educating the museum community about how to file a complaint and the investigation process; and 3) overseeing the implementation of this policy, grievance procedures, and the investigation process. All questions or complaints may be referred to the Coordinators at the Department of Human Resources. General contact information for the office is below. Information about specific personnel for each component within the office can be found in CMP’s grievance procedure within this policy, entitled “Reporting Procedure for Sex Discrimination & Harassment.” Coordinators can be reached at the Department of Human Resources, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, 4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, 412-622-3311, HRConnect@carnegiemuseums.org. The CMP Coordinator is: Scope of Policy This policy supplements CMP’s other anti-discrimination and harassment policies for persons covered by the terms of this policy. Prohibited Conduct Defined – Harassment and Discrimination Sex Harassment and Discrimination All CMP employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing CMP employees and students who participate in CMP’s educational programs or activities under this policy based on that individual’s sex or gender (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and regardless of the harasser’s sex or gender. Sexual harassment means any harassment based on someone’s sex or gender. It includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual’s sex or gender), as well as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or visuals, or any other conduct that is of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment includes various forms of offensive behavior based on sex. Examples of prohibited conduct can be found in CMP’s policy on “Sexual & Other Unlawful Harassment.” Other Harassment or Discrimination Under this policy, CMP also prohibits discrimination or harassment by employees, volunteers, students, trustees, advisory board members, committee members, contractors, vendors, or other CMP-affiliated individuals against students who participate in CMP’s educational activities or programs on the basis of that student’s age (40 and over), race, color, national origin, or disability, as required by law.

Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent practical and permitted by law. Investigations will be conducted as confidentially as possible and related information will only be shared with others on a need-to-know basis. Those involved in such investigations are required to be truthful, accurate, and cooperative throughout the investigation process. Those who report misconduct are known as complainants. Those against whom a complaint is lodged are known as respondents. Complaints should be as detailed as possible and include a description of the complained of conduct, the names of all individuals involved as well as any witnesses, and the dates on which the complained of conduct occurred. If discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment, will be taken. CMP may also report conduct to law enforcement, as appropriate. Initial Assessment The Coordinator will conduct an initial assessment of any reported conduct. As part of the assessment, the Coordinator will, among other things: consider the expressed resolution preferences by the reporting party; assess the circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct; address any immediate physical and emotional safety concerns; notify the reporting party of their right to contact law enforcement if warranted by the circumstances; provide the reporting party with information about the procedural options available under this policy; assess for pattern evidence by the respondent; and explain CMP’s policy prohibiting retaliation. Following the initial assessment, the Coordinator will determine whether this policy is implicated and whether an informal or formal resolution is appropriate and articulate those conclusions to the complainant. CMP strives to assess, investigate, and resolve all reports of potential misconduct under this policy within sixty (60) days. Resolution and Investigation Procedures Informal Resolution CMP’s informal resolution process aims to appropriately investigate and, if necessary, address alleged misconduct without requiring a formal resolution process described below. Under an informal resolution process, a complainant reports alleged misconduct under this policy to the Coordinator. The Coordinator will give notice to the respondent of the alleged misconduct and may gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the Coordinator may gather additional information by meeting with relevant witnesses (identified by either the Coordinator or the complainant and respondent) and collecting any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party may be heard throughout the informal resolution process. CMP strives to complete any informal resolution process within thirty (30) days; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. Following an investigation, the Coordinator may or may not then impose sanctions or other disciplinary action as appropriate. Neither party may appeal an informal resolution once final. Formal Resolution If the Coordinator deems a formal resolution to be appropriate, CMP will begin the formal resolution process described in this sub-section. CMP strives to complete any formal resolution process within sixty (60) days excluding any appeals; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations. During an investigation, both complainants and respondents may have an appropriate advisor who may observe any hearings or interviews as well as provide support, guidance, and advice during an investigation. The Coordinator will begin or continue an investigation by providing written notice to each party that an investigation has begun and will also appoint an investigator. The appointed investigator may be a CMP Coordinator that will not formally adjudicate the complaint or external appointed investigator appointed at CMP’s sole discretion. The appointed investigator will gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent. At their discretion, the investigator may conduct other fact-finding by meeting with relevant witnesses and gathering any evidence, including correspondence between the parties. Each party is entitled to be heard throughout the investigation process. Following the investigation, the investigator will submit a written report summarizing the facts and outlining areas of agreement and disagreement between the parties. The report may redact irrelevant or prejudicial information as necessary. The Coordinator will then share the report with each party, allowing them time to review. A party has five (5) days to review the report and submit responses for consideration into the final report. Once a report is finalized, the investigator will determine whether the respondent is responsible for the alleged misconduct. The investigator will use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard and inquire whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of misconduct. Upon this determination, the investigator will recommend adjudicatory action and sanctions to the Coordinator, including, but not limited to: a warning letter, suspension, expulsion, termination, or a no contact order. The Coordinator will then formally adjudicate through a written letter to each party notifying them of the outcome. Either party has the right to appeal the adjudicatory action letter submitted by the Coordinator. A party must appeal the letter in writing within ten (10) days and must state one of three limited grounds: 1) a procedural error which materially affected the outcome of the investigation; 2) the existence of new information unavailable to the investigators during the investigation which could have materially affected the outcome; or 3) the recommendation of the investigators and/or adjudicatory action taken by the Coordinator was clearly erroneous based on the evidence gathered during the investigation. Appeals must be heard by an Appeal Officer. The Appeal Officer may be any Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator not involved in the original proceeding. The Appeal Officer will review the findings of fact, investigation record, investigator recommendations, and adjudication letter to determine whether the appealed decision should be affirmed or reversed. The Appeal Officer must submit a written determination within fifteen (15) days of an appeal.  ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh"

        "content": "Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive The Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive is a living resource of 20th-century American life as seen through the lens of Charles “Teenie” Harris and activated by the participation of the Pittsburgh community and dedicated museum staff. The archive primarily consists of over 75,000 black-and-white and color negatives that comprise Harris’s work as a photojournalist, studio owner, and artist. In addition, nearly 5,000 feet of 16mm motion picture film includes original footage, spliced with commercial newsreel and cartoon footage from the 1940s and 1950s. In 2001, Carnegie Museum of Art purchased the negatives and all rights from the artist’s family and formed an initial advisory committee of Harris family members, academics, and Pittsburgh community leaders, who have since informed how the museum stewards the archive. In addition to this group’s specialized knowledge, many more archive users and stakeholders from a range of lived experiences have helped identify people, places, and events depicted in the photographs over the years. Critical details based on first-person accounts and cutline information found in Harris’s professional work with Flash, a weekly news picture magazine based in Washington, DC, and the Pittsburgh Courier also inform the archive’s catalogue information. As was common with newspaper photographers, Harris did not title individual images. For cataloguing and identification purposes, museum staff have assigned descriptions to the photographs based on their content. Beginning in 2005, archivists began gathering oral histories from people whose lives have intersected with Harris’s or the subjects of his images. The archive now holds over 60 oral histories. This important resource is of unparalleled value to historians, authors, film, television, and theater producers, documentarians, educators, students, and, most importantly, Pittsburgh’s African American community from which it originated. Today, Carnegie Museum of Art continues the work of identifying and updating the archive’s information through connecting with researchers and people whose experiences and familial memories are reflected in the photographs the museum stewards. The Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive is open to all visitors who want to access it for personal, scholarly, and artistic projects. Browse the Archive →  In the Galleries FAQs The Charles “Teenie” Harris Archive consists primarily of photographic negatives. As a whole, the collection consists of more than 70,000 negatives (58,970 of which are 4×5 inch black-and-white negatives; 14,350 are black-and-white negatives in medium formats estimated between 1965 and the 1980s; and 454 are nitrate negatives in varying sizes that seem to date from the late 1910s to early 1940s). Additionally, the collection contains an undetermined number of 35mm black-and-white and color negatives that have yet to be cataloged and approximately 5,000 feet of 16mm motion picture film, featuring original Harris footage spliced with commercial newsreel and cartoon footage, most from the 1940s. Finally, Carnegie Museum of Art maintains 560-lifetime gelatin silver prints of Harris images, including many that were printed or hand-colored by the artist. Separately, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s Oliver Room holds 3,000 prints acquired in 1997. The archive’s holding of negatives contains most of Harris’s work but may not be complete. Certain negatives of documented Harris images are missing. A small portion of the archive may be the work of other photographers for the Pittsburgh Courier. Where doubt exists, the catalog record reads “attributed to Charles ‘Teenie’ Harris” if the work is likely to be his; or “American, 20th century” if the photographer’s identity is unknown. Copy negatives of another photographer’s work are ascribed to Harris “after another photographer,” who is named if known. How do we catalog the negatives?Carnegie Museum of Art actively sought to shape its management of the archive in collaboration with an advisory committee of Harris family members, academic specialists, and Pittsburgh community leaders who insisted on the African American community’s ownership of the history represented in Harris’s images. Consequently, the archive catalog is based on first-person accounts by Harris’s subjects and contemporaries or contemporaneous publications such asFlash Newspicture Magazineand thePittsburgh Courier. It is updated regularly as new information becomes available.Titles of Harris’s photographs are descriptive and based on the content of the image. As an intentional practice, community members or contemporaneous published sources such as thePittsburgh Courierprovide valuable information such as personal names, locations, dates, and events.

Carnegie Museum of Art actively sought to shape its management of the archive in collaboration with an advisory committee of Harris family members, academic specialists, and Pittsburgh community leaders who insisted on the African American community’s ownership of the history represented in Harris’s images. Consequently, the archive catalog is based on first-person accounts by Harris’s subjects and contemporaries or contemporaneous publications such asFlash Newspicture Magazineand thePittsburgh Courier. It is updated regularly as new information becomes available. Titles of Harris’s photographs are descriptive and based on the content of the image.
